# Phase 6 Final Report: Root Cause Analysis Complete

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Session Duration**: ~8 hours  
**Result**: Root cause definitively identified  
**Next Steps**: Clear path to resolution  

## Executive Summary

Through systematic investigation across 6 phases, we have definitively identified the root cause of the detector geometry correlation issue (4% vs target >99.9%). The problem is **NOT** in beam center calculations or rotation logic, but in **basis vector rotation calculations** that produce different results between C and Python implementations.

## Journey to Discovery

### Phase 1-2: Initial Investigation
- ✅ Built parallel trace infrastructure
- ✅ Identified pivot mode mismatch (C using BEAM instead of SAMPLE)

### Phase 3: Pivot Mode Fix
- ✅ Fixed C parameter generation to use correct pivot mode
- ❌ Correlation remained at 4% - pivot mode wasn't the root cause

### Phase 4: Beam Center Investigation
- ✅ Fixed MOSFLM axis mapping (F↔S swap)
- ✅ Corrected unit conversion assumptions
- ❌ Correlation still at 4% - beam center wasn't the full issue

### Phase 5: Rotation Hypothesis Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive rotation test suite
- ✅ Proved rotation matrices are mathematically identical
- ❌ Rejected rotation hypothesis - matrices were perfect

### Phase 6: Deep C Analysis & Final Discovery
- ✅ Discovered C logging bug (showed 5.125e-05 instead of 0.05125)
- ✅ Confirmed beam center calculations are actually correct
- ✅ **FOUND IT**: Basis vector calculations differ by 39mm for tilted case

## The Root Cause

### What's Working ✅
- **Baseline detector**: 99.34% correlation (excellent!)
- **Beam center**: Perfect match (0.05125 m)
- **Rotation matrices**: Mathematically identical
- **Pivot mode**: Correctly using SAMPLE when needed

### What's Broken ❌
**Basis vector rotation produces different results:**
```
Configuration: rotx=5°, roty=3°, rotz=2°, twotheta=20°

Python pix0_vector: [0.109814, 0.022698, -0.051758] m
C pix0_vector:      [0.095234, 0.058827, -0.051702] m
Difference:         39mm (enough to destroy correlation)
```

### Why It Happens
1. **Convention switching**: C automatically switches from MOSFLM to CUSTOM when `-twotheta_axis` is specified
2. **Different calculation paths**: Even accounting for conventions, the rotation sequences produce different results
3. **Compounding effect**: The 39mm offset propagates to all pixels, causing 4% correlation

## Technical Details

### Key Discovery from C Code Analysis
The C code has complex convention logic:
```c
if(twotheta_axis_specified) {
    convention = CUSTOM;  // No +0.5 pixel offset
} else {
    convention = MOSFLM;  // Adds +0.5 pixel offset
}
```

This wasn't documented and creates different geometric calculations.

### Verification Method
Created multiple debugging tools:
- `debug_tilted_detector.py`: Step-by-step geometry tracing
- `compare_c_python_pix0.py`: Direct pix0_vector comparison
- `test_convention_fix.py`: Convention switching logic test

## Path to Resolution

### What Needs to Be Fixed
1. **Implement CUSTOM convention** in PyTorch when twotheta_axis is specified
2. **Match exact rotation sequence** that C uses for basis vectors
3. **Verify pix0_vector** matches within 1e-12 tolerance

### Expected Outcome
Once basis vector calculations match:
- pix0_vector difference should be < 1e-12 m
- Correlation should jump from 4% to >99.9%
- All test cases should pass

## Lessons Learned

1. **Logging can mislead**: The C logging bug sent us down wrong paths
2. **Systematic testing works**: Each phase eliminated possibilities
3. **Trace infrastructure is invaluable**: Parallel traces found the exact issue
4. **Convention documentation critical**: Undocumented CUSTOM convention caused confusion
5. **Small differences matter**: 39mm offset destroys correlation completely

## Artifacts Created

### Test Infrastructure
- 5 diagnostic tools in Phase 4
- 4 rotation test scripts in Phase 5
- 3 debugging scripts in Phase 6
- Comprehensive trace comparison framework

### Documentation
- Detailed phase reports for each investigation
- Root cause analysis documents
- Convention discovery documentation
- Implementation checklists

## Metrics

- **Total investigation time**: ~8 hours
- **False leads pursued**: 3 (pivot mode, beam center, rotation matrices)
- **True root cause**: Basis vector calculation difference
- **Lines of diagnostic code**: ~2000
- **Correlation improvement**: 0% so far (fix not yet implemented)

## Recommendation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement CUSTOM convention handling in PyTorch Detector
2. Fix basis vector rotation sequence to match C
3. Validate correlation achieves >99.9%

### Estimated Time to Fix
- Implementation: 1-2 hours
- Validation: 30 minutes
- Total: 2.5 hours to complete resolution

## Conclusion

After extensive investigation, we have definitively identified that the detector geometry correlation issue stems from a 39mm difference in basis vector calculations between C and Python implementations. This is caused by undocumented convention switching in the C code and different rotation calculation sequences.

The path to resolution is clear: implement the CUSTOM convention logic and match the exact basis vector rotation sequence. This should immediately resolve the correlation issue and achieve the target >99.9%.

**Status**: Investigation complete, root cause identified  
**Next Phase**: Implementation of basis vector fix  
**Confidence Level**: Very high - issue precisely localized

**Follow-up**: The definitive root cause was discovered in a subsequent session - see [`history/2025-01-10_convention-switching-breakthrough.md`](./history/2025-01-10_convention-switching-breakthrough.md). The C code analysis was correct, but the real issue was that the test infrastructure was forcing C into CUSTOM convention while PyTorch used MOSFLM, creating a false comparison. Fix involved correcting the test infrastructure, not the PyTorch implementation.
