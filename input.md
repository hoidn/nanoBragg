Summary: Close out C18 ledger by logging the 900s tolerance evidence in the tracker and fix_plan records.
Mode: Docs
Focus: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 / Next Action 15 – Phase Q ledger and tracker closure
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T071423Z/ledger_update.md (summary of tracker edits)
Do Now: Update reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md with the C18 839.14 s result and tolerance approval; append Attempt entry #80 in docs/fix_plan.md referencing the tracker update (no pytest).
If Blocked: Capture current tracker snapshot to reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T071423Z/ledger_update_blocked.md and note blocker in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts.
Priorities & Rationale:
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T071423Z/summary.md — validation evidence for 839.14 s runtime and 900 s ceiling.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:525 — codifies the 900 s tolerance that must be mirrored in tracker.
- arch.md:375 — architecture note referencing the same tolerance; tracker must match this source.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:38 — checklist reminder about slow-gradient expectations, ensure tracker cross-links here.
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md (Phase Q table) — now shows Q4 [D]; Q6 remains open until tracker is updated.
How-To Map:
- Edit reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md: move C18 status to RESOLVED, log runtime 839.14 s and tolerance 900 s, cite phase_q/20251015T071423Z summary.
- Document the change in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts as Attempt #80 (Phase Q Q6) pointing at the tracker path and new ledger snapshot.
- Write reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T071423Z/ledger_update.md summarizing the edits (include before/after counts and links to tracker + fix_plan rows).
- Skip pytest; after edits run git status and capture diffs for tracker + fix_plan + new summary.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not alter non-C18 rows in remediation_tracker.md.
- Keep ASCII formatting; avoid breaking table alignment in tracker.
- Preserve existing artifact paths; reference the exact STAMP directories already in use.
- Do not update tolerance docs again—just reference them.
- No full-suite pytest reruns this loop; evidence-only per mode.
Pointers:
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:525
- arch.md:375
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:38
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md (Phase Q section)
Next Up: If time remains, start staging remediation_tracker.md updates for C2 gradient guard closure audit (still pending cross-check).
