Summary: Close Phase R by aggregating chunk 03 evidence and syncing the ledgers so the test-suite initiative can archive cleanly.
Mode: Docs
Focus: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase R ledger sync (R4)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_r/20251015T102654Z/summary.md; reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md; docs/fix_plan.md
Do Now: Next Action 18 — Phase R ledger sync (documentation aggregation); no pytest run required
If Blocked: Capture the outstanding blockers in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history and drop a TODO in plans/active/test-suite-triage.md under Phase R R4, then stop.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:800 ties R4 to the new summary + tracker sync, so completing it clears the critical initiative gate.
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md:374 documents R4 exit expectations; aligning artifacts here keeps Ralph’s workflow deterministic.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_r/20251015T102654Z/timing_summary.md is the canonical runtime evidence that the summary must quote.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_r/20251015T102654Z/commands.txt ensures future reruns can reproduce the guarded ladder.
How-To Map:
- export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md
- Draft reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_r/20251015T102654Z/summary.md summarizing Attempt #84: include totals (43 pass / 9 skip / 1 xfail), 846.60 s runtime, env guard citation, and reference timing_summary.md + commands.txt.
- Update reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md to reflect Phase R completion (C18 row resolved, 43 pass chunk baseline, Phase R status).
- Refresh docs/fix_plan.md entry [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] logging Attempt #84 completion, mark Next Action 18 done, and cite new summary path.
- Verify plans/active/test-suite-triage.md Phase R R4 guidance still matches the final steps once edits land; note completion in Attempts History.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not rerun pytest; this loop is documentation-only evidence capture.
- Keep protected assets (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, supervisor.sh, input.md) untouched.
- Preserve 905 s tolerance messaging pulled from timing_summary.md; do not revert to 900 s.
- Avoid editing historical attempt stamps or artifact directories outside the new summary.
- Ensure environment variable snippets stay inline (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 etc); no multiline shell fragments.
- When editing markdown tables, maintain pipe alignment and checklist markers ([ ], [P], [D]).
- Do not collapse Attempt history bullets in docs/fix_plan.md—append instead.
- Keep vectorization or parity plans untouched; focus solely on Phase R aggregation.
- Respect ASCII-only edits; no Unicode beyond existing content.
- Check git status before finishing to avoid stray files.
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:800
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md:374
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_r/20251015T102654Z/timing_summary.md
- arch.md:360
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:520
Next Up: If time remains, stage Phase R summary handoff by preparing a skeleton ledger_update.md under reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_r/20251015T102654Z/.
