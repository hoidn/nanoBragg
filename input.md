Summary: Close Phase K3 by refreshing the remediation tracker and syncing the ledger.
Mode: Docs
Focus: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Full pytest run and triage
Branch: main
Mapped tests: none — docs-only (Phase K3 tracker refresh)
Artifacts: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/, reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_k/20251011T072940Z/analysis/summary.md, docs/fix_plan.md
Do Now: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase K3 tracker refresh — update phase_j remediation docs and extend Attempt #16 (docs-only)
If Blocked: Capture the blocker in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log and ping galph in galph_memory.md before switching tasks.
Priorities & Rationale:
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_k/20251011T072940Z/analysis/summary.md lines 38-63 call for Phase K3 tracker updates before resuming remediation.
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md lines 29-54, 146-154 now gate completion on K3 tracker + ledger sync.
- docs/fix_plan.md lines 60-79 list the new Next Actions (tracker refresh, extend Attempt #16, unpause SOURCE-WEIGHT-002).
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md needs counts/status freshened (C3→4 failures, mark C2/C15 resolved) per Phase K data.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_sequence.md still shows determinism sprint pending; update progress bar + remaining targets to keep Sprint 1 sequencing accurate.
How-To Map:
- Edit reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md to: set C3 count=4 & status "in_progress", mark C2/C15 as ✅ resolved with Attempt #10 validation note, update totals (31 failures, 14 clusters), and refresh executive summary stats.
- Update reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_sequence.md: mark Sprint 1.1 Determinism COMPLETE, adjust Sprint 1 progress (3/17 failures resolved), and note next focus (Sprint 1.2 Source Weighting with 4 failures remaining).
- Append tracker-refresh details + artifact pointers to docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #16 entry once edits are staged; keep numbering intact and cite updated reports paths.
- Record new artifact stamps if you duplicate phase_j/ tracker files; otherwise note "Updated" + timestamp inside each document.
- No pytest required this loop; run `git diff` before commit to verify only docs changed.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not change counts for clusters without new evidence (only C2, C3, C15 shift this loop).
- Keep Phase J documents timestamped; if you copy to new folder, mirror naming scheme `phase_j/<STAMP>/` and update references accordingly.
- Preserve markdown tables' alignment; use monospace counts so downstream parsing scripts remain stable.
- Do not modify reports outside Phase J/K directories or any protected asset listed in docs/index.md.
- Avoid editing plan checkpoints unrelated to C2/C3/C15; other clusters stay frozen until new evidence.
- Maintain Attempt numbering continuity in docs/fix_plan.md (stay on Attempt #16; note tracker refresh as continuation).
- Keep source-weighting plan paused until tracker refresh is committed; note this in fix_plan if timing slips.
- Remember to set `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` only when running torch code—no executions needed here.
- Avoid introducing new plan IDs or changing priorities without supervisor sign-off.
- Run git status before commit to ensure only the intended docs are staged.
Pointers:
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md:29-54,146-154 — current Phase K status + K3 checklist.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_k/20251011T072940Z/analysis/triage_summary.md — latest counts to port into tracker.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md — document to update with new counts.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_sequence.md — sprint ordering to adjust.
- docs/fix_plan.md:60-79 — refreshed Next Actions + Attempt #16 anchor for ledger sync.
Next Up: once tracker/ledger are updated, resume [SOURCE-WEIGHT-002] Phase C implementation (Option A) per sprint roadmap.
