Context Reminders:
- Phase F1–F3 evidence already landed; this loop only consolidates documentation.
- CUDA benchmarks remain blocked; do not attempt GPU runs until device-placement fix exists.
- Keep timestamps consistent with existing Phase F bundles (20251009, 20251222) to avoid fragmenting evidence.
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase F4 summary consolidation — run `pytest --collect-only -q` after drafting `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/summary.md`, appending to `commands.txt`, and syncing plan + ledger updates.
If Blocked: Capture blocker details in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/summary_blockers.md` with command transcripts, document the stall in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts, keep plan row F4 marked [ ], and notify supervisor in the Attempt narrative.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/vectorization.md:72 — F4 remains the lone open Phase F task; summary deliverable is the gate for moving to Phase G.
  Confirm the row flips to [D] and references Attempt #16 after this loop.
- docs/fix_plan.md:3385 — Next Actions now foreground F4 consolidation and require explicit reference to the CUDA perf blocker.
  Keep the blocker paragraph verbatim so downstream loops know the exact condition to rerun CUDA.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/perf/20251009T050859Z/perf_summary.md — Canonical CPU metrics (13.80 Mpx/s @ 256², 18.89 Mpx/s @ 512²) that must be quoted.
  Preserve the 0.0% deltas; they prove no regression occurred.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/perf/20251009T050859Z/perf_results.json — Raw data backing the summary tables (200 repeats per size).
  Pull variance/stddev numbers directly rather than rounding them away.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/validation/20251222T000000Z/summary.md — Source for the Phase F2 functional proof that needs to be cited verbatim.
  Reference the specific tests (8/8) and oversample toggles when summarising.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/validation/20251222T000000Z/env.json — Environment metadata to replicate in the combined summary.
  Mention masked CUDA + CPU device to show device neutrality.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md#1.4 — Device/dtype discipline that the summary must affirm (CPU evidence complete, CUDA pending blocker).
  The summary should explicitly state CUDA rerun is blocked, aligning with §1.4 expectations.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md#1.5 — Requires collect-only proof for documentation loops; hence the mapped test.
  Include the collect log path so reviewers know the proof exists.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md — Checklist items should be ticked in the summary to show compliance.
  Cite the checklist to demonstrate vectorization guardrails were observed.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70-150 — Background on vectorization expectations; cite if explaining why no perf regression occurred.
  Pull phrasing when describing why vectorisation kept throughput flat.
- docs/index.md — Reminder that Protected Assets must stay untouched when editing docs; ensure compliance is restated if necessary.
How-To Map:
- Step 1: Re-read Phase F2 validation summary and environment files to extract the exact test cases, devices, and results that need to be referenced.
  Highlight oversample toggles, tilted detector cases, and CPU-only execution in your notes.
- Step 2: Review Phase F3 perf bundle (`perf_summary.md`, `perf_results.json`, `commands.txt`, `env.json`) and note throughput, variance, and regression thresholds for both detector sizes.
  Capture both cold and warm timings; they belong in the summary tables.
- Step 3: Inspect existing `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/summary.md` (if present); if absent, create it with front-matter covering initiative, timestamp, and commit SHA.
- Step 4: Draft the summary with sections for Context, Validation Recap, Performance Recap, Runtime Checklist Compliance, CUDA Blocker Status, and Next Steps so reviewers can skim by topic.
- Step 5: Embed markdown tables comparing Phase F2 validation outcomes and Phase F3 performance metrics against their respective baselines; cite the exact artifact paths in footnotes for reproducibility.
- Step 6: In the validation section, list the eight AT-ABS-001 tests by name and result so the reader can see coverage breadth.
- Step 7: In the performance section, include both throughput (Mpx/s) and mean warm runtime, plus standard deviation to reinforce stability.
- Step 8: Explicitly reference docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md and highlight which guardrails were satisfied during F2/F3 work.
- Step 9: Add a “Blockers & Follow-ups” section that re-states the CUDA device-placement issue (docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #14) and prescribes the trigger for rerunning GPU benchmarks.
- Step 10: Append a “Commands & Evidence” section listing the commands executed historically (from the existing bundles) plus the new collect-only proof so evidence trails remain intact.
- Step 11: Update `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/commands.txt` by appending git SHA, date, a note about the summary doc, and the exact `pytest --collect-only -q` command (ensure chronological order preserved).
- Step 12: Run `pytest --collect-only -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_f/pytest_collect_phase_f4.log 2>&1` to provide discoverability proof; mention the log in the summary and Attempt.
- Step 13: Add a short paragraph in the summary that references docs/development/testing_strategy.md#1.4-1.5 to frame why CPU-only evidence suffices today.
- Step 14: Once the summary is finalized, flip plan row F4 to [D] with a note referencing the summary file and Attempt #16; ensure Status Snapshot remains accurate.
- Step 15: Add Attempt #16 under docs/fix_plan.md summarizing the summary content, key metrics, commands log, collect-only output, and reiterating the CUDA blocker status (include links to both bundles).
- Step 16: Re-read `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to verify they now point at CUDA rerun + Phase G tasks after your edits and that no stale guidance remains.
- Step 17: Double-check `git status -sb` to ensure only expected documentation files changed prior to handing off.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Forgetting to cross-link both Phase F2 and Phase F3 bundles inside the new summary.
  Each section should cite the exact timestamped directory.
- Dropping the explicit mention of the CUDA benchmark blocker and its trigger for resolution.
  Without it, future loops may re-run CUDA prematurely.
- Skipping updates to `commands.txt`, which would break the evidence chain for Phase F.
  Commands log is mandatory for every evidence bundle.
- Rewriting or removing existing validation/perf artifacts; this loop should add references only.
  Preserve historical files untouched.
- Omitting the collect-only log, leading to a testing strategy violation.
  The log proves selectors still import; keep it in reports/.
- Leaving plan row F4 or docs/fix_plan Next Actions in an inconsistent state after documenting progress.
  Double-check both files before committing.
- Editing production code paths or tests; stay in documentation/plan files only.
  Performance code changes belong to separate loops.
- Neglecting to cite the PyTorch runtime checklist compliance in the summary narrative.
  Explicitly state which bullets were satisfied.
- Forgetting Protected Assets from docs/index.md when modifying documentation files.
  Do not rename/delete files listed there.
- Misstating metrics (e.g., rounding away the 0.0% delta that underpins the “no regression” claim).
  Quote to at least two decimal places.
- Allowing the summary to imply CUDA perf is complete when it remains blocked.
  Make the blocker section prominent.
- Losing track of timestamp conventions; all paths should stay under the existing 20251009 / 20251222 bundles.
  New artifacts (like collect log) should match the Phase F root directory.

Next Up:

- 2) After the summary lands, begin Phase G documentation updates (runtime checklist, architecture notes) and log closure Attempt marking VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 complete.
