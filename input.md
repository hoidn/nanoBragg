Summary: Synthesize the Phase L failure set into Phase M artifacts (failures.json, cluster mapping, tracker delta, next-steps brief).
Mode: Docs
Focus: docs/fix_plan.md#test-suite-triage-002-full-pytest-rerun-and-triage (Next Action 20 — Phase M failure synthesis & remediation hand-off)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2026-01-test-suite-refresh/phase_m/$STAMP/{analysis,notes}
Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md#test-suite-triage-002-full-pytest-rerun-and-triage — Execute Phase M tasks M1–M4 using Phase L STAMP `reports/2026-01-test-suite-refresh/phase_l/20251015T190350Z/` as input. Capture failures.json, cluster_mapping.md, tracker update, and next_steps.md under a new Phase M STAMP, then record the attempt in docs/fix_plan.md and galph_memory.
If Blocked: Document the blocker (e.g., missing scripts, parsing failure) in `reports/2026-01-test-suite-refresh/phase_m/$STAMP/analysis/blockers.md` with log snippets and notify galph via fix_plan Attempts History.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/test-suite-triage-phase-h.md: Phase M table (M1–M4) requires synthesis artifacts before remediation can resume.
- docs/fix_plan.md: Active Focus now targets Phase M; Next Action 20 flagged READY pending classification bundle.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-refresh/phase_l/20251015T190350Z/analysis/summary.md: Provides authoritative failure counts and deltas to reference in the mapping.
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md: Baseline tracker that must be refreshed with Phase L counts.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §1.4: Reference for environment/timeouts when describing gradient timeout remediation options in next steps.
How-To Map:
- `STAMP=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`
- `BASE=reports/2026-01-test-suite-refresh/phase_m/$STAMP`
- `mkdir -p "$BASE"/analysis "$BASE"/notes`
- `INPUT=reports/2026-01-test-suite-refresh/phase_l/20251015T190350Z`
- Parse failures: `python - <<'PY2'
import json, sys
from pathlib import Path
failures = []
for line in Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text().splitlines():
    if line.startswith('FAILED '):
        parts = line.split()
        failures.append({"nodeid": parts[1], "summary": ' '.join(parts[2:])})
Path(sys.argv[2]).write_text(json.dumps(failures, indent=2) + '\n')
PY2" "$INPUT"/logs/pytest_full.log "$BASE"/analysis/failures.json`
- Map clusters: create `$BASE/analysis/cluster_mapping.md` summarising each failure group (CREF, PERF, TOOLS, CLI, GRAD, VEC) with links to Phase G + Phase L summaries; flag any new regressions.
- Tracker refresh: either edit `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md` in-place with new counts or author `$BASE/analysis/tracker_update.md` detailing deltas and owner assignments; note whichever path you take in the doc header.
- Next steps brief: draft `$BASE/analysis/next_steps.md` with remediation ordering, required decisions (e.g., gradient timeout policy), and selectors/commands per cluster.
- Update documentation: append Attempt entry to `docs/fix_plan.md` (Next Action 20) citing `$BASE`; add the run to galph_memory Attempts History with STAMP + key findings.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not overwrite or delete Phase L artifacts; reference them read-only.
- Avoid running pytest; this loop is evidence-only.
- Keep failure parsing deterministic (stable ordering, include nodeids).
- When updating the remediation tracker, preserve existing historical rows and note deltas clearly.
- Reference authoritative docs (specs/arch/testing strategy) when noting remediation implications.
- Include absolute or repo-relative paths in all new markdown tables.
- Use ASCII only; avoid Unicode bullets/quotes.
- Commit updates after verifying diffs; no partial edits left staged.
- Update fix_plan and galph_memory in the same STAMP to avoid drift.
- Do not modify protected assets listed in docs/index.md.
- Capture $STAMP in every new artifact filename or header to maintain traceability.
