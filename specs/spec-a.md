# nanoBragg Spec A â€” Sharded Specification

Spec A is now organized across multiple shards. Read them together for the full normative contract.

- [spec-a-core.md](spec-a-core.md): Core physics, geometry, sampling, data, and associated acceptance tests.
- [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md): CLI surface area, precedence rules, and CLI-focused acceptance tests.
- [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md): Conformance profiles, parallel validation suites, and developer tooling requirements.

Each shard cross-references the others; updates must keep them consistent.
