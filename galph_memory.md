## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (galph loop current)
- `git pull --rebase` blocked by long-standing dirty artifacts (`parallel_test_visuals/*`, `.claude`, `trash/test_parity_matrix.py`); left untouched per policy.
- Deep analysis vs long-term goals:
  * AT-012: commit 7f6c4b2 introduced cross-product rescaling but still fails triclinic parity (corr 0.9658) and breaks Core Rule #13 by sticking with formula `V_star`; tests relaxed to rtol=3e-4.
  * Performance: `_compute_physics_for_position` still compiled per instantiation; inline tensor factories and `.to()` calls remain; crystal clamps still allocate guard tensors—same bottlenecks blocking perf goals.
  * Agent hygiene: Ralph continues verification-only loops despite routing rules; recent commits (7f6c4b2) lack diagnostics and introduce spec regressions.
- Actions this loop:
  * Updated `plans/active/at-parallel-012/plan.md` to highlight the 7f6c4b2 regression and require restoring `V_actual` (Task C0) plus reinstating 1e-12 test tolerances.
  * Logged Attempt #14 in `docs/fix_plan.md` recording the failed parity attempt and Core Rule #13 violation; added regression note under the active item.
- Next steps for Ralph:
  1. Work under `prompts/debug.md`, revert the formula-volume change, and execute Plan Tasks A1–B2 before re-running parity.
  2. Capture fresh rotation matrix traces (Plan A1/A2) and store under `reports/2025-09-30-AT-012-debug/`.
  3. Defer performance work until AT-012 parity passes and metric duality is back to ≤1e-12.

## 2025-09-30 (galph loop L)
- Reviewed dirty state, stashed for `git pull --rebase`, re-applied afterward (coin roll = heads triggered commit review).
- Findings toward long-term goals:
  * `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:489-668` still constructs guard tensors with `torch.tensor(...)` inside the hot path and keeps formula-volume `V_star`, so Core Rule #13 remains broken and every call recreates device/dtype constants.
  * `src/nanobrag_torch/utils/geometry.py:210-239` builds rotation matrices via `R = Rz @ Ry @ Rx` with fresh `torch.zeros(...)`; orientation vs C remains unverified and matrix allocation happens on CPU regardless of caller device.
  * `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:193-233` performs repeated `torch.tensor(1e-12, ...)` allocations and an `incident_beam_direction.to(...)` inside the compiled kernel; this matches the perf slowdowns captured in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` (≤256² still ~200× slower than C).
- Ralph history check (last ~5 commits):
  * 7f6c4b2 claims parity fix but keeps triclinic corr at 0.9658, relaxes metric-duality tests to 3e-4 (`tests/test_crystal_geometry.py:175-234`), and drops portable-path discipline in new debug scripts (`reports/2025-09-30-AT-012-debug/compare_rotation_matrices.py:11`).
  * 058986f introduces WIP misset reorder plus `loop.sh` automation that unconditionally re-runs `prompts/main.md`, perpetuating routing violations.
- Actions this loop:
  * Added `ROUTING-LOOP-001` to `docs/fix_plan.md` with explicit steps to strip the extra `prompts/main.md` call and redundant `git pull` invocations from `loop.sh`.
  * No new multi-turn plan; existing AT-012 and PERF plans already cover needed technical work.
- Open items for next loop:
  1. Ensure AT-012 Plan Phase A (C/Py rotation matrix diff) actually starts; no artifacts yet.
  2. Enforce restoration of 1e-12 metric-duality tolerances once V_actual reinstated.
  3. After loop.sh guard lands, confirm automation stays on `prompts/debug.md` while AT parity fails.

## 2025-09-30 (galph loop M)
- Alternate-path recovery completed: rebase aborted, merged remote hygiene commit, preserved supervisor updates, and pushed combined history (`git merge origin/feature/spec-based`, commits `5d5c411`, `a385365`, `98ecc0b`).
- Restored `loop.sh` as a protected automation asset with single `prompts/debug.md` invocation per loop to enforce routing compliance; script lives at repo root and remains executable.
- Remote now synchronized; only `.claude` submodule remains dirty (user-managed). Next supervisor loop should verify Ralph updates Plan `ROUTING-LOOP-001` before altering the script further.

## 2025-10-01 (galph loop N)
- Coin flip → tails, so skipped commit-history audit this round and focused on strategic triage.
- Deep-dive checkpoints vs long-term goals:
  * **Parity:** `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` still uses formula-volume `V` when regenerating reciprocal vectors, so Core Rule #13 metric duality stays broken; Plan AT-PARALLEL-012 remains untouched beyond A0. Ralph must execute tasks A1–C3 prior to another parity attempt.
  * **Performance:** `_compute_physics_for_position` no longer calls `.to()`, but helper layers (`angles_to_rotation_matrix`, misset rad conversion) keep allocating CPU tensors every instantiation; Dynamo graph signatures still churn, blocking cache reuse. Also noted residual guard factories created via `torch.tensor(...)` in crystal cross-product rescaling.
  * **Agent hygiene:** fix_plan still listed reopened items as "done"; cleared that ambiguity and called out routing/plan dependencies explicitly.
- Updated `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` to phased template with explicit Phase 1 checklist (P1.1–P1.5) covering geometry helper refactor + compile graph capture; added cache/fusion phases with concrete exit criteria.
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md`: flagged PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 1 blockers, annotated reopened AT-012/REPO-HYGIENE-002 entries, and logged new audit update directing Ralph to finish P1.x before cache work.
- Follow-ups for Ralph:
  1. Resume AT-PARALLEL-012 plan at Phase A once working under `prompts/debug.md`; restore `V_actual` path and capture rotation matrix comparisons.
  2. When parity unblocked, execute PERF plan Phase 1 tasks (P1.1–P1.4) and archive compile trace diffs as required by P1.5 before attempting caching.
  3. Close routing loop guard (`ROUTING-LOOP-001`) so automation stops invoking `prompts/main.md`.

## 2025-10-01 (galph loop O)
- Deep dive (long-term goals):
  * `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:651-670` still locks to formula volume (`V_star = 1/V`) and skips `V_actual`, violating Core Rule #13 and explaining persistent triclinic parity failure.
  * `tests/test_crystal_geometry.py:175-234` tolerances remain relaxed to 3e-4, masking the metric-duality regression introduced in 7f6c4b2.
  * `_compute_physics_for_position` retains hot-path tensor factories (e.g., `torch.tensor(1e-12)` in the tophat branch), keeping torch.compile caches unstable and blocking perf gains.
- Coin flip → heads: reviewed Ralph commits `7f6c4b2`, `f0aaea7`, `a52ceec`.
  * `7f6c4b2` reintroduced formula-volume logic and loosened unit tests without raising parity correlation (still ≈0.9658).
  * `f0aaea7` falsely marked AT-012 complete with no new metrics or artifacts; parity still fails.
  * `a52ceec` swapped `torch.maximum` → `clamp_min`, but left other dynamic tensor allocations and guard tensors in place.
- Actions:
  * Recast `plans/active/at-parallel-012/plan.md` into phased checklist (Phases A–E) and added explicit tasks to restore `V_actual` and reinstate 1e-12 tolerances.
  * Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Active Item + Attempt history (Attempt #16 marked INVALID) and added guardrail forbidding status changes without fresh parity artifacts.
- Follow-ups for Ralph:
  1. Execute Plan Phase A (C/Py rotation matrices) and Phase B trace capture under `prompts/debug.md`.
  2. Restore `V_actual` and strict metric duality tolerances before any new parity attempt (Plan Phase C/D).
  3. After geometry fix, resume PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 1 tasks (remove remaining tensor factories). If `.claude` artifacts persist, ignore as user-managed but ensure clean staging before supervisor loops.

## 2025-10-01 (galph loop P)
- Synced with remote (git pull --rebase) before review; no conflicts this round.
- Closed AT-PARALLEL-012 effort: archived plan at `plans/archive/at-parallel-012/plan.md` with all phases marked [D]; docs/fix_plan.md summary now reflects Attempt #16 success (corr≈0.99963, tolerances back to 1e-12).
- Verified routing automation: `loop.sh` now emits only `prompts/debug.md`; logged proof under `reports/routing/2025-10-01-loop-verify.txt` and marked `[ROUTING-LOOP-001]` as done in fix_plan.
- Performance gaps vs long-term goals remain: `_compute_physics_for_position` still fabricates tensors every call (`torch.tensor(1e-12)` etc.), `sincg` lattice branch uses `.item()` inside hot loops, and guards in `crystal.py`/`simulator.py` still rely on `torch.maximum` (see `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:289,770,1182`). PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 1 tasks P1.1–P1.5 remain outstanding.
- Action items for Ralph next loop: follow PERF plan Phase 1 (hoist guard tensors, eliminate `.item()` in hot path), then tackle REPO-HYGIENE-002 checklist; no further parity work needed unless regressions appear.
- Repo state: `.claude` remains locally dirty per user policy; no other uncommitted files.
- Updated supervisor startup instructions: attempt `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, abort on timeout, then fall back to merge pull; log whichever path occurs.
- Current branch should be `feature/spec-based`, but repo is presently in detached HEAD due to the ongoing rebase; fix before next loop.

## 2025-10-01 (galph loop Q)
- Startup sync: unstaged local edits blocked `git pull --rebase` (galph_memory.md/supervisor.sh); stashed, completed the existing rebase, restashed, pulled latest (commit 1940066), restored local notes. Repo now clean except for plan/fix_plan updates made this loop.
- Coin flip → tails, so skipped commit-history audit per instructions.
- Long-term goal assessment:
  * `scripts/benchmarks/investigate_compile_cache.py` (commit 1940066) only measures CPU float64 single-source cases and emits console text—no GPU coverage, no JSON artifacts, no multi-source proof.
  * `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` currently throws `ZeroDivisionError` when warm setup hits 0 (observed while invoking `--help`), leaving PyTorch vs C steady-state comparison unverified.
  * Torch.compile still wraps the shim method per instance; caching appears to work for trivial cases but lacks validation for mixed dtype/device workloads, so performance claims remain anecdotal.
- Actions this loop:
  * Reopened PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 2/3 objectives by rewriting `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` to focus on multi-device cache validation and steady-state benchmarking (Phases 2–4 checklists refreshed).
  * Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` active item and attempt log with new blocking issues (missing GPU coverage, benchmark tool crash) and linked plan tasks.
- Follow-ups for Ralph:
  1. Extend `investigate_compile_cache.py` per plan P2.1, then run CPU/GPU cache validation batches and publish JSON/log artifacts (P2.2–P2.4).
  2. Harden `benchmark_detailed.py` to tolerate zero warm-setup time and add CLI size controls before collecting new CPU/GPU runs (P3.1–P3.3).
  3. Only after capturing these metrics decide whether further graph work (Phase 4) is needed.
- Repo status for next loop: expect pending changes in docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md until committed this round; no other dirty files tracked.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop R)
- Startup sync succeeded (timeout 30 `git pull --rebase` → already up to date); no conflicts to resolve.
- Deep scan vs long-term goals surfaced three hot spots: (1) ROI mask reallocated every run inside the compiled region (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:579-598`), (2) misset conversion still instantiates fresh tensors per invocation (`src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:598-604`), and (3) `sincg`/`sinc3` compile wrappers create new graphs per detector geometry (`src/nanobrag_torch/utils/physics.py:24-102`). Bench tooling still lacks multi-device coverage (`scripts/benchmarks/investigate_compile_cache.py`) and the warm-speed print divides by zero when warm setup hits 0 (`scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py:243-267`).
- Updates this loop:
  * Logged new findings in `docs/fix_plan.md` (PERF-PYTORCH-004 update; REPO-HYGIENE-002 marked as reopened) and expanded the PERF plan with tasks P2.5 (Dynamo logs) and P3.4 (ROI/misset caching) plus revised P3.5 decision gate.
  * No new multi-turn plan required beyond refreshing PERF roadmap; repo hygiene plan remains active.
- Guidance for Ralph next loop:
  1. Implement plan tasks P2.1–P2.5, emitting JSON + `TORCH_LOGS=dynamic` artifacts under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-compile-cache/`.
  2. While touching the simulator for P3.4, hoist ROI mask/misset tensors and rerun benchmarks per plan P3.1–P3.5.
  3. After ROI caching lands, revisit performance gap vs C and decide on Phase 4 only if warm runs remain >1.5× slower.
- Repo state leaving loop: only `docs/fix_plan.md` and `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` modified; will commit as SUPERVISOR perf-alignment update. `.claude` and other user-managed artifacts untouched.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop S)
- Startup sync: `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` returned "Already up to date."; no conflicts or dirty files before analysis.
- Deep review confirmed the simple_cubic AT-012 harness still enforces an 86% peak-match tolerance; fresh run yielded `Correlation 1.0`, `Matches 43 / 50` (command logged via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python - <<'PY' ... PY`).
- Added active fix item `[AT-PARALLEL-012-PEAKMATCH]` to `docs/fix_plan.md` with guidance to investigate the missing peaks, archive diagnostics under `reports/2025-10-02-AT-012-peakmatch/`, and only tighten the assertion once ≥95% matches are restored.
- No new multi-turn plan needed; PERF roadmap already covers ROI mask/misset caching and Dynamo logging from prior loop, but reiterate that Phase 2 tasks (multi-device cache validation) remain outstanding.
- Guidance for Ralph:
  1. Execute the new fix_plan item by diagnosing the missing simple_cubic peaks, publishing parity artifacts, and tightening the assertion once ≥95% matches are achieved.
  2. Continue PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 2 work (P2.1–P2.5) and prep for Phase 3 once cache validation artifacts exist.
  3. While investigating AT-012, confirm the triclinic/tilted variants remain at spec; queue follow-up if additional relaxations surface.
- Repo state on exit: modified `docs/fix_plan.md` and `galph_memory.md` only (no code changes).
## 2025-09-30 17:04:25 (galph loop current)
- Reviewed docs/fix_plan.md against prompts/update_fix_plan.md; file deviates heavily from required template (no per-item Reproduction/Attempts sections, multiple items updated per loop, inflated status claims).
- Header still states AT suite fully passing and AT-012 fixed despite prior logs showing parity failures; needs correction and pruning before Ralph loops resume.
- Determined no new multi-turn plan yet; priority is to rewrite fix_plan using canonical structure and strip duplicate routing-violation entries.
- Heads coin flip → skimmed latest commits (8974cb4..00f822a); activity dominated by supervisor touch-ups, no new technical progress from Ralph to assess.
- Tree left clean; no commits this loop.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop T)
- Local dirty: prompts/update_fix_plan.md predates this loop; left untouched per policy.
- Deep scan for long-term goals flagged multi-source broadcast bug (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:109-135) still raising expand shape errors when sources>1; perf plan Phase 2 remains blocked on this.
- Reconfirmed per-run ROI mask fabrication and mask dtype casts (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:586-602, 950-979) likely causing the missing peaks; noted constant tensor factories in __init__ (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:358-395) and misset tensor rebuilds (src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:565-608).
- Benchmark tooling gaps persist: investigations script still CPU-only (scripts/benchmarks/investigate_compile_cache.py) and detailed benchmark divides by zero on 0s warm setup (scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py:249-287).
- Authored new phased plan at plans/active/at-parallel-012-peakmatch/plan.md and cross-referenced fix_plan; item now ready for Ralph to execute under prompts/debug.md.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: Phase A of peak-match plan (rerun test, capture artifacts) then Phase B tracing; continue PERF-PYTORCH-004 P2.1–P2.5 once multi-source expand fix lands.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop T addendum)
- Noted existing working-copy edit in `prompts/update_fix_plan.md`; change predates this loop and left untouched per supervisor policy.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop U)
- Restored `docs/fix_plan.md` with compact active item ledger plus key completed sections (Protected Assets, routing guard, AT-024 regression, PERF Phase 2, triclinic fix); added dtype hypothesis to AT-012 plan (Phase B4).
- Reintroduced `docs/fix_plan_archive.md` to hold extended history while keeping main plan at 204 lines (<1000).
- Next actions for Ralph: follow updated plan B4 (float32 vs float64 peak detection) during AT-012 investigation, continue REPO-HYGIENE-002 H1–H6, and execute PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan tasks P2.1–P2.5 / P3.1–P3.5.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop V)
- Startup sync: `git pull --rebase` initially blocked by `prompts/update_fix_plan.md`; stashed (`git stash push -m "galph-pre-pull"`), pull returned "Already up to date.", then `git stash pop` restored the pending edit.
- Deep analysis toward long-term goals:
  * AT-012 peak gap now traced to dtype: rerunning the simple_cubic harness and casting `simulator.run()` to float32 before `find_peaks` yields 50/50 matches (mean Δ0.0 px) whereas float64 stays at 45/50 (43 matched). Command logged under `python - <<'PY' ...` and codified as Plan Phase B4 (`plans/active/at-parallel-012-peakmatch/plan.md`).
  * Multi-source configuration still brittle—`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:404` dereferences `beam_config.source_wavelengths` without a fallback; providing `source_directions` alone reproduces the AttributeError. Needs default-to-main-wavelength handling before Phase 3 performance work.
  * Benchmark tooling bug confirmed: `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py:149` sums the boolean `cache_hit` flag into `timings['total']`, inflating warm-run totals by +1 s and masking true torch.compile gains. Also observed the warm-path divide-by-zero warning when setup=0.
  * Test harness still enforces the relaxed 86% threshold (`tests/test_at_parallel_012.py:169`); tightening awaits the dtype fix plus ROI checks in Phase B1–B3.
- Coin flip → heads → commit review: inspected `51110d4`, `cb6a761`, `a661afc`, `be3398b`.
  * `51110d4` correctly validated torch.compile caching but left multi-source failure and benchmark timing bug unresolved; float32 cache speedup numbers remain valid but need refreshed once CLI is fixed.
  * `cb6a761` patched device drift (`F_cell.to(...)`) yet retained CPU-only constants; full device neutrality (incident beam, cached tensors) still outstanding.
  * `a661afc` documented GPU issues without actionable mitigation; needs follow-through once simulator constants are hoisted.
  * `be3398b` solved the AT-024 float mismatch cleanly—no regressions spotted.
- Planning/docs updates:
  * Verified `plans/active/at-parallel-012-peakmatch/plan.md` now includes Phase B4 dtype task plus supervisor note; no new plan required beyond reinforcing Phase B execution order.
  * `docs/fix_plan.md` already captured Attempt #2 (float32 diagnostic); added guidance to PERF entry to cover the cache_hit bug and missing `source_wavelengths` guard.
- Guidance for Ralph next loop:
  1. Execute AT-012 Plan Phase A artifacts, then Phase B (including new B4 dtype experiment) before touching core physics; archive results under `reports/2025-10-02-AT-012-peakmatch/`.
  2. Patch `Simulator.__init__` to default `source_wavelengths` to `beam_config.wavelength_A` when multi-source directions are supplied, and rerun multi-source torch.compile cache tests.
  3. Fix `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py:149` to exclude booleans from total time and rerun the 256–1024² benchmarks so PERF Phase 3 can compare against C accurately.
- Repo state leaving loop: clean tree (users' `prompts/update_fix_plan.md` restored untouched); no commits made this run.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop W)
- Reinforced fix_plan pruning guidance: `prompts/update_fix_plan.md` now warns against over-pruning and sets a target of ~500 lines when trimming a >1000-line plan so key context stays in the main ledger.
- No other files touched; tests not run (docs-only update).

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop X)
- Compared legacy `./fix_plan.md` with canonical ledger; migrated missing high-value notes (AT-PERF device neutrality, parity harness bootstrap, AT-020 absorption fix) into `docs/fix_plan_archive.md`.
- Replaced stray standalone file with symlink `fix_plan.md -> docs/fix_plan.md` to prevent divergent ledgers going forward.
- Tests not run (docs + symlink hygiene only).

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop X addendum)
- Reminder: `./fix_plan.md` is now a symlink to `docs/fix_plan.md`; always edit the canonical file and avoid recreating standalone copies.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop Y)
- Sync: `git pull --rebase --autostash` required because existing working-tree edits blocked the standard pull; re-applied cleanly with no conflicts.
- Deep dive: AT-012 plan still lacks Phase A artifacts; `Simulator.__init__` multi-source branch raises when `source_wavelengths` is omitted; repeated `torch.compile(...)` wrapping per instance keeps warm-up cost high and still builds guard tensors on the hot path.
- Planning: Added Phase 3 task P3.0 in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (multi-source defaults) and cross-referenced it in `docs/fix_plan.md` so Ralph must fix defaults before benchmarking.
- Coin flip (heads): Reviewed commits `78be581`, `51110d4`, `cb6a761`, `a661afc`; GPU neutrality fix still leaves incident-beam tensors CPU-bound, benchmark tooling remains broken, and multi-source crash persists.
- Next for Ralph: Execute AT-012 Plan Phase A/B (esp. dtype experiment), implement PERF P3.0 alongside benchmark fixes, and address torch.compile rewrap/device-neutrality backlog before new perf claims.

## 2025-10-02 (galph loop Z)
- Sync: `git pull --rebase` completed cleanly; no stash needed.
- Findings vs goals:
  * Performance: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:786-804` applies polarization after the multi-source sum using `self.incident_beam_direction`, so divergent beams never get per-source Kahn weighting; this breaks AT-SRC-001 parity and blocks trustworthy benchmarks.
  * Stability: same file (`lines 401-414`) still dereferences `beam_config.source_wavelengths` without a fallback; multi-source configs built via CLI helpers continue to crash until defaults redirect to `wavelength_A`.
  * Peak-match initiative stagnates—`plans/active/at-parallel-012-peakmatch/plan.md` remains untouched (Phase A checklist all [ ]), so no new artifacts exist to drive the >95% threshold fix.
  * Tooling: `benchmark_detailed.py` issues logged earlier remain; perf plan must still harden CLI + totals before fresh numbers mean anything.
  * Reminder: accidentally launched Python without `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK` during a quick tensor truthiness check—error reproduced, reran with env set; worth reinforcing to Ralph.
- Actions:
  * Updated `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (Phase 3) with task P3.0b to fix per-source polarization/weighting semantics and noted issue in discovered-issues list.
  * Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` `[PERF-PYTORCH-004]` Observations/Next Actions to call out P3.0b alongside defaults/benchmark tasks.
  * Committed and pushed `SUPERVISOR: PERF plan multi-source guard - tests: not run` on `feature/spec-based`.
- Coin flip: tails → no commit review this loop.
- Guidance for Ralph next: 1) Execute PERF Plan P3.0 and new P3.0b before re-running cache/benchmark scripts (capture logs under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-perf-summary/`); 2) Start AT-012 Plan Phase A (baseline artifacts + float32 comparison) so we can move on to divergence tracing; 3) Fix `benchmark_detailed.py` aggregation (P3.1) immediately after the multi-source fixes so performance evidence is usable.
- Repo state: clean after push.

## 2025-10-03 (galph loop AA)
- Sync: `git pull --rebase` returned already up to date; no conflicts.
- Findings vs goals: multi-source defaults still dereference `beam_config.source_wavelengths` without a fallback (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:397), per-source polarization still uses the global beam vector in both subpixel and pixel paths (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:786, 904), and `benchmark_detailed.py:118` keeps adding the boolean `cache_hit` flag into total timing; AT-012 float64 peak drop remains the active hypothesis (Plan Phase B4).
- Coin flip (heads): No new engineer commits beyond `78be581` and `51110d4`; both still leave multi-source crash + polarization + timing bugs unresolved—flagged for follow-up.
- Planning/docs: Updated `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` task P3.1 to call out the `cache_hit` aggregation fix; other plans remain accurate.
- Next actions for Ralph: execute AT-012 Plan Phase A/B (esp. dtype artifact capture), deliver PERF Plan P3.0/P3.0b fixes before benchmarking, and patch `benchmark_detailed.py` totals as part of P3.1.

## 2025-10-03 (galph loop AB)
- Sync: Required temporary stash to satisfy `git pull --rebase`; re-applied cleanly and confirmed only `galph_memory.md` remained dirty.
- Deep analysis toward goals: confirmed multi-source path still pins polarization to `self.incident_beam_direction` and uncovered a new normalization gap—`steps` divides by Σweights so PyTorch averages source intensities while nanoBragg.c sums them—alongside the existing `source_wavelengths` None crash and `benchmark_detailed.py` total-time boolean bug.
- Coin flip (heads) → commit review: `51110d4` delivered cache validation but left multi-source crash, polarization, and benchmark math unfixed; `78be581` correctly patches detector device drift; earlier WIP commits (`cb6a761`, `a661afc`) documented the device-neutrality effort but still staged regressions that must be completed (normalization, per-source Kahn weighting, CLI robustness).
- Planning/docs updates: added Task P3.0c to `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` for multi-source normalization parity and noted the issue under discovered problems; refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` `[PERF-PYTORCH-004]` observations to call out P3.0c alongside existing P3.0/P3.0b/P3.1 guidance.
- Next steps for Ralph: 1) Execute plan tasks P3.0–P3.0c before rerunning benchmarks (fix fallback, per-source polarization, and normalization), 2) capture AT-012 Phase A artifacts then run Phase B4 float32 diagnostic with archived reports, 3) patch `benchmark_detailed.py` totals per P3.1 and rerun perf suite once multi-source issues are resolved.

## 2025-10-03 (galph loop AC)
- Sync: python-enforced 30s timeout `git pull --rebase` succeeded; tree clean, no stashing required.
- Deep analysis vs goals: multi-source path still fails without explicit wavelengths (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:401-405`, `:644-668`), polarization continues to use the global beam vector so per-source Kahn weighting is wrong in both subpixel and pixel paths (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:786-817`, `:840-857`), and normalization still divides by Σweights causing weighted averages (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:660-668`). Existing PERF plan Phase 3 (tasks P3.0–P3.0c) already targets these defects.
- Coin flip = heads → commit audit: no new Ralph commits since 78be581 (device-neutrality patch). Multi-source crash/semantics regressions remain unresolved; reiterate need to execute P3.0/P3.0b/P3.0c before new perf claims.
- docs/fix_plan.md and active plans remain accurate; no new plan authored this loop.
- Next steps for Ralph: complete PERF Phase 3 tasks (fallback, per-source polarization, normalization), run AT-SRC-001 + benchmark reproductions with artifacts under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-perf-summary/`, then proceed to AT-012 peak-match Plan Phase A/B once multi-source path is stable.

## 2025-10-03 (galph loop AD)
- Sync: `git pull --rebase` already up to date; no stashing needed.
- Deep analysis vs goals: multi-source path still lacks wavelength fallback (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:394-416`), polarization continues to reuse the global `self.incident_beam_direction` after the per-source accumulation (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:793-817`, `:847-864`), and normalization still divides by `source_weights.sum()` so intensities average instead of matching C (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:652-668`). AT-012 peak-match plan remains untouched—no report dir under `reports/2025-10-02-AT-012-peakmatch/` yet—and float64 vs float32 discrepancy persists. `benchmark_detailed.py` total aggregation bug (boolean `cache_hit`) still unfixed, blocking trustworthy perf numbers.
- Coin flip = heads → commit review: no engineer commits after `78be581`; last work stopped at device-neutrality fix, leaving Phase 3 PERF tasks untouched. Feedback needed: Ralph must execute P3.0–P3.0c before running benchmarks and capture AT-012 Phase A artifacts instead of re-looping prompts.
- Planning/docs: Existing plans (PERF Phase 3, AT-012 peakmatch) remain correct; no new plan drafted this loop.
- Next for Ralph: 1) Execute PERF Plan tasks P3.0–P3.0c with artifacts under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-perf-summary/`; 2) Run AT-012 Phase A commands and store outputs under `reports/2025-10-02-AT-012-peakmatch/`; 3) Patch `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` totals per P3.1 before quoting performance data.
- Repo state: only `galph_memory.md` updated; commit/push pending at loop end.
## 2025-10-03 (galph loop AE)
- Sync: `git pull --rebase` returned "Already up to date"; no conflicts or stashes.
- Deep-dive vs long-term goals:
  * Multi-source path still broken in `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (lines ~400-680): missing wavelength fallback (`source_wavelengths` `.to()` on None), polarization still uses `self.incident_beam_direction` rather than per-source vectors inside the oversample path, and `steps` divides by Σweights so intensities average instead of summing (see plan tasks P3.0/P3.0b/P3.0c).
  * AT-012 peak-match plan untouched: no artifacts under `reports/2025-10-02-AT-012-peakmatch/`, peak finder still drops to 43/50 in float64; Phase A checklist needs to run before new hypotheses.
  * Perf hotspots linger: `Simulator.run()` rebuilds ROI mask + `torch.as_tensor` constants every call; plan P3.4 (ROI/misset caching) should stay high priority once multi-source fixes land.
- Planning decision: Existing active plans (`at-parallel-012-peakmatch`, `perf-pytorch-compile-refactor`, `repo-hygiene-002`) already cover the needed multi-turn work; no new plan drafted.
- Ralph status: No engineer commits since 78be581 (device-neutrality fix); pending work is executing Plan AT-012 Phase A/B and PERF Phase 3 tasks.
- Follow-ups for next loop: 1) Confirm Ralph captures AT-012 Phase A artifacts + float32/float64 comparison; 2) Ensure PERF tasks P3.0–P3.0c start (fallback, polarization, normalization) before new benchmarks; 3) Push progress on repo-hygiene-002 (H1–H4 not started).
