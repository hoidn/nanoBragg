## 📊 Test Results Summary

### Distance Scaling Test Results

| Distance (mm) | Rotation Effect (mm) | Effect/Distance Ratio |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|

### Statistical Analysis
- **Linear fit:** rotation_effect = 0.0000 * distance + 11.6689
- **R² correlation:** 0.6208 (no linear scaling)
- **Slope:** Essentially zero (0.0000)
- **Intercept:** 11.67mm (constant offset)

## 🔍 Critical Insights

### 1. Rotation Effect is Distance-Independent
The rotation effect remains **exactly 11.67mm at all detector distances**. This completely rules out rotation center differences as the cause, because:
- Different rotation centers would cause errors that scale linearly with distance
- Expected relationship: `error = distance * sin(rotation_angle)`
- Observed relationship: `error = constant`

### 2. The Error is a Constant Transformation
The constant 11.67mm offset suggests a **fixed coordinate transformation error** rather than a geometric scaling issue.

### 3. Correlation Analysis Context
From previous correlation testing:
- **Baseline correlation:** 0.993441 (excellent - no fundamental coordinate issues)
- **Tilted correlation:** 0.317875 (poor - rotation logic has problems)

## 📈 Hypothesis Status Update

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **H1: Different Rotation Centers** | ❌ **RULED OUT** | Error is constant, not distance-dependent |
| **H2: Beam Position Interpretation** | 🟡 **POSSIBLE** | Could cause constant offset |
| **H3: Unit Conversion Error** | 🟡 **POSSIBLE** | Could cause constant offset |
| **H4: Missing Coordinate Transformation** | 🔴 **LIKELY** | Constant offset pattern fits |
| **H5: Detector Thickness/Parallax** | ❌ **UNLIKELY** | Would be distance-dependent |
| **H6: Integer vs Fractional Pixel** | 🟡 **POSSIBLE** | Could cause constant offset |

## 🎯 Most Likely Explanations

### Primary Suspect: H4 - Missing Coordinate Transformation
The constant 11.67mm offset strongly suggests:
- A **fixed transformation matrix error** in rotation logic
- **Missing or incorrect coordinate system conversion** 
- **Wrong reference point** for rotations (but not distance-dependent)
- **Sign error** or **axis swap** in rotation calculations

### Secondary Suspects: H2/H6 - Systematic Position Errors
- **Beam center interpretation differences** between C and PyTorch
- **Pixel indexing convention differences** (integer vs fractional)
- **MOSFLM convention implementation errors**

## 🔧 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Action: Deep Dive into Rotation Logic
1. **Compare rotation matrices** between C and PyTorch implementations
2. **Validate basis vector calculations** before and after rotations  
3. **Check coordinate system handedness** (right-hand rule consistency)
4. **Verify rotation order** (rotx → roty → rotz → twotheta)

### Diagnostic Tests
1. **Test individual rotations** (rotx only, roty only, rotz only) to isolate the error
2. **Compare basis vectors** at each rotation step
3. **Test SAMPLE vs BEAM pivot modes** to see if pivot logic affects the constant
4. **Test identity rotation** (all rotations = 0) to confirm baseline accuracy

### Code Investigation Priority
1. **Detector rotation implementation** in PyTorch vs C code
2. **MOSFLM convention handling** and pixel offset calculations  
3. **Pivot mode selection logic** and reference point calculations
4. **Coordinate transformation matrices** used in rotation pipeline

## 💡 Key Insight: The Problem is in the Rotation Logic, Not Geometry

The excellent baseline correlation (0.993) combined with the constant rotation error (11.67mm) indicates:
- ✅ **Coordinate systems are fundamentally correct**
- ✅ **Unit conversions are working properly**  
- ✅ **Basic geometry calculations are accurate**
- ❌ **Rotation transformations have a systematic error**

This is actually **good news** - the error is localized to the rotation logic rather than being a fundamental architectural problem.

## 📋 Success Criteria for Fix

When the issue is resolved, we should see:
- **Tilted configuration correlation > 0.99** (matching baseline)
- **Rotation effect approaches zero** for identity configurations
- **Linear scaling behavior** for any remaining distance-dependent effects
- **Consistent behavior** across all pivot modes and rotation combinations

---

**Bottom Line:** The 28mm systematic offset is caused by a constant transformation error in the rotation logic, not by different rotation centers. Focus debugging efforts on coordinate transformations and rotation matrix calculations.
