Rotation Matrix for Triclinic P1 Test Case
==========================================

The actual rotation matrix that transforms the unrotated reciprocal vectors
to the rotated ones in trace.log is:

U = [ -0.789333,  -0.583113,   0.192982]
    [ -0.056213,  -0.245344,  -0.967989]
    [  0.611718,  -0.774736,   0.160402]

This matrix satisfies:
- a*_rotated = U @ a*_unrotated
- b*_rotated = U @ b*_unrotated
- c*_rotated = U @ c*_unrotated

Important Notes:
1. The misset angles (-89.968546, -31.328953, 177.753396) degrees were likely
   extracted from a randomly generated unitary matrix using umat2misset().
   
2. Due to the non-uniqueness of Euler angle representations, applying these
   angles in X-Y-Z order does NOT reproduce the original rotation matrix.
   
3. For the PyTorch implementation, we should either:
   a) Store and use the rotation matrix directly (most accurate)
   b) Use a different Euler angle convention that matches nanoBragg's umat2misset
   c) Accept that the misset angles are for reference only and use the matrix

4. The determinant is very close to 1.0 (1.000405), confirming this is a
   proper rotation matrix with minimal numerical error.
