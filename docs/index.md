# Project Documentation Index

Welcome to the central index for all `nanoBragg-PyTorch` project documentation. This guide provides a map to the key technical specifications, development processes, and historical records that define the project.

The documentation is organized into two main categories:

* **üèõÔ∏è Permanent Documentation:** Living documents that define the current state, architecture, and processes of the project. **These are essential for all contributors.**
* **üóÑÔ∏è Archival Documentation:** A historical record of plans, debugging sessions, and reports. Valuable for understanding project evolution and the context behind design decisions.

## üóÑÔ∏è Archival Documentation

This collection provides the historical context of the project's development. It is not required for daily work but is invaluable for understanding the rationale behind current design choices.

### Historical Debugging Sessions (`history/`)
* **[Debugging Session Relationship Map](../history/debugging_session_relationship_map.md)** - **Best entry point for the archive.** A visual timeline and detailed index of all major debugging sessions related to detector geometry.
* **[Example Session: 8-Phase Investigation](../history/2025-01-09_detector-geometry-8-phase-debug.md)** - A comprehensive log of a ~10-hour systematic debugging effort that precisely localized a critical bug.

### Initiative & Feature Plans (`initiatives/` and `plans/`)
* **[Initiatives Directory](../initiatives/)**: Contains detailed plans, checklists, and findings for major development efforts, such as the `detector-correlation-fix` and `parallel-trace-validation` initiatives.
