This index captures previously documented bugs, conventions, and parity gaps so follow-on agents can recall the highest-impact findings without rereading the full archives.

| Finding ID | Date | Keywords | Synopsis | Evidence Pointer | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BUG-C-001 | 2025-10-07 | c-bug, phi, rotation, state-carryover | The C code incorrectly uses the final φ rotation from the previous pixel for the first φ step (φ=0) of the current pixel. | [Link](docs/bugs/c-parity-001.md) | Active |
| BUG-C-002 | 2025-10-09 | c-bug, misset, radians, mosaic | The random misset branch feeds 90-degree inputs into `mosaic_rotation_umat`, so the helper builds rotation matrices capped at 90 radians and yields non-physical orientations. | [Link](docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md) | Active |
| API-001 | 2025-10-05 | cli, pix0_vector_mm, units, meters | The `-pix0_vector_mm` CLI flag is parsed as metres instead of millimetres, introducing a silent 1000× detector-origin error unless users pre-convert the inputs. | [Link](docs/bugs/c-cli.md) | Active |
| API-002 | 2025-10-21 | cli, pix0, beam-center, override | When custom detector vectors are supplied, specifying `-pix0_vector_mm` recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` and silently overrides any `-Xbeam/-Ybeam` geometry inputs. | [Link](docs/bugs/c-cli.md) | Active |
| CONVENTION-001 | 2025-01-09 | detector, convention, custom, offset | Specifying any detector-vector flag (e.g., `-twotheta_axis`) silently switches the calculation convention to CUSTOM, which removes the `+0.5` pixel offset from beam center calculations. | [Link](docs/architecture/undocumented_conventions.md) | Active |
| CONVENTION-002 | 2025-09-19 | detector, units, meters, parity | Detector geometry computations must remain in metres; running them in Angstroms drove 10⁹-scale pixel errors until the hybrid meter/Angstrom scheme restored correlation. | [Link](docs/debugging/detector_geometry_debugging.md) | Resolved |
| BUG-C-003 | 2025-10-09 | c-bug, logging, beam-center, units | The TRACE_C `beam_center_m` output divides metre values by 1000 yet still labels them as metres, giving misleading 5e-05 readouts. | [Link](docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md) | Active |
| CONVENTION-003 | 2025-09-17 | pivot, detector, sample, twotheta | The C implementation automatically switches to SAMPLE pivot mode when `-detector_twotheta`, `-Xclose/-Yclose`, or XDS convention inputs are present, even if `-pivot sample` is not set. | [Link](docs/architecture/undocumented_conventions.md) | Active |
| CONVENTION-004 | 2025-10-09 | vectorization, scattering, units, parity | Phase C traces showed the PyTorch scattering vector stayed in Å⁻¹ instead of C’s m⁻¹, creating the first divergence and a 10⁷× intensity error across pixels. | [Link](reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T061605Z/summary.md) | Active |
| CONVENTION-005 | 2025-10-09 | vectorization, fluence, scaling, parity | The vectorized fluence path mixes unit systems, producing a 10⁹× scaling error that wipes out physical signal until the conversion chain is corrected. | [Link](reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T061605Z/summary.md) | Active |
| CONVENTION-006 | 2025-10-09 | vectorization, lattice, normalization, sinc | The PyTorch `sincg` implementation omits the `Na×Nb×Nc` normalization present in C, so lattice factors are under-scaled by roughly two orders of magnitude. | [Link](reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T061605Z/summary.md) | Active |
| PERF-001 | 2025-10-10 | oversample, omega, edge, parity | Phase E0 concluded that reusing the last subpixel’s solid angle, polarization, and absorption when oversample averaging is disabled induces edge-pixel bias that holds full-frame correlation at 0.721. | [Link](reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_e0/20251010T092845Z/summary.md) | Active |
