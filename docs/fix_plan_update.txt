VECTOR-PARITY-001 Attempt #9 Update:
===================================
Date: 2025-10-10
Result: SUCCESS (Phase C1 C-trace capture complete)

Summary:
Captured C traces for pixels (2048,2048), (1792,2048), (4095,2048) using existing -trace_pixel mechanism in nanoBragg.c. Each log contains 72 TRACE_C lines with detector geometry and pixel-specific physics.

Details:
- No additional C-code instrumentation required (existing trace infrastructure at lines 3380-3395)
- Each pixel: 72 TRACE_C output lines including:
  * Detector geometry (pix0_vector, basis vectors, rotation matrices)
  * Pixel physics (I_before_scaling, r_e_sqr, fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polar, omega_pixel)
  * Final scaled intensity
- Execution: ~60s per pixel (full 4096Â² simulation required for correct physics)
- All three traces completed cleanly, no errors

Git Status:
Clean (reports/ directory gitignored per .gitignore:13-14)

Next Actions:
1. Phase C2: PyTorch trace capture for same three pixels
2. Phase C3: Trace diff & first divergence analysis

This update should be merged into docs/fix_plan.md [VECTOR-PARITY-001] Attempts History.
