# Command: /complete-phase

**Goal:** Manage the end-of-phase transition using a formal review cycle and a hardened, intent-driven Git commit process. This command operates in two distinct modes, determined by the presence of a review file.

---

## üî¥ **CRITICAL: MANDATORY EXECUTION FLOW**

**You MUST operate in one of two modes. You are not allowed to mix them.**

**Mode 1: Request Review (Default)**
*   **Trigger:** No `review_phase_N.md` file exists for the current phase.
*   **Action:** You MUST execute the **Review Request Generation Protocol** below **in its entirety as a single, atomic script**. Do not modify it or run it in pieces. After execution, you MUST HALT.

**Mode 2: Process Review**
*   **Trigger:** A `review_phase_N.md` file EXISTS for the current phase.
*   **Action:** You MUST read the review, parse the `VERDICT`, and then either commit the changes (on `ACCEPT`) using the **Safe Staging and Commit Protocol** or report the required fixes (on `REJECT`).

**DO NOT:**
-   ‚ùå Commit any code without a `VERDICT: ACCEPT` from a review file.
-   ‚ùå Use `git add -A` or `git add .`. You must use the explicit, plan-driven staging logic.
-   ‚ùå **Abandon the provided scripts.** If a script fails, report the complete error message and STOP. Do not attempt to "fix" it by running commands manually; the script's atomicity is essential for safety.

---

## üìã **YOUR EXECUTION WORKFLOW**

### Step 1: Determine Current Mode
1.  Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to find the path and phase number (`N`) of the **current active initiative**.
2.  Check if the file `<path>/review_phase_N.md` exists.
3.  If it exists, proceed to **Mode 2: Process Review**.
4.  If it does not exist, proceed to **Mode 1: Request Review**.

---

### **MODE 1: REQUEST REVIEW**

#### **Review Request Generation Protocol (v3 - Enhanced)**
You will now execute the following shell script block in its entirety. It is designed to be robust against common failures like multi-entry status files and large, untracked repository files.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# --- END OF ENHANCED PROTOCOL ---
```

#### **Final Step: Notify and Halt**
-   Inform the user that the review request is ready at `<path>/review_request_phase_N.md`.
-   **HALT.** Your task for this run is complete.

---

### **MODE 2: PROCESS REVIEW**

#### Step 2.1: Read and Parse Review File
-   Read the file `<path>/review_phase_N.md`.
-   Find the line starting with `VERDICT:`. Extract the verdict (`ACCEPT` or `REJECT`).
-   If no valid verdict is found, report an error and stop.

#### Step 2.2: üî¥ MANDATORY - Conditional Execution (On `ACCEPT`)
-   If `VERDICT: ACCEPT`, you MUST execute the **Safe Staging and Commit Protocol** below.

#### Step 2.3: Conditional Execution (On `REJECT`)
-   If `VERDICT: REJECT`, extract all lines from the "Required Fixes" section of the review file.
-   Present these fixes clearly to the user.
-   **HALT.** Make no changes to Git or status files.

## üîí **Safe Staging and Commit Protocol (For `ACCEPT` Verdict)**

#### **Safe Staging and Commit Protocol (v3 - Enhanced)**
If `VERDICT: ACCEPT`, you MUST execute this precise sequence of commands as a single script.
