review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-06 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the CUSTOM pix0 transform; Phase H3b2/H3b3 now enforce the precedence rule (commit d6f158c) and the regression test captures both override paths. Residual geometry error persists: PyTorch still reports a +3.9 mm Y-offset between the C `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR` (−0.216476, 0.216343, −0.230192 m) and PyTorch output (−0.2125, 0.2190, −0.2302 m) when custom vectors are present. Evidence shows C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` from the post-rotation `pix0_vector` (see nanoBragg.c 1822–1860); replicating that workflow is the next blocker before Phase H4 parity.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A/B/C2/D3/E/F1/F2/G1/G2/G3 ✅; Phase F3 parity rerun + Phases H–I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: Execute Phase H4 tasks in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (H4a) port the post-rotation `newvector` projection from nanoBragg.c 1822–1860 so CUSTOM pix0 derives `Fbeam/Sbeam` and refreshes `distance_corrected`; (H4b) regenerate C/PyTorch traces for the supervisor command (polarization disabled) and document pix0/`F_latt` deltas ≤5e-5 m under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/`; (H4c) tighten `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot` tolerances to ≤5e-5 m, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v`, and log Attempt #25 with metrics.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #25 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase H4a-c complete). **Post-rotation beam-centre recomputation implemented and verified.**
    Metrics: pix0_vector parity achieved - C vs PyTorch deltas < 2e-8 m (well within 5e-5 m tolerance). Test suite: test_cli_flags.py 23/23 passed, test_detector_geometry.py 12/12 passed, test_crystal_geometry.py 19/19 passed (54 total).
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:692-726` - Ported nanoBragg.c lines 1851-1860
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/` - Implementation notes, parity summary, C/PyTorch traces
      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py:451-452,483-489,517-525` - Updated test with corrected beam_center mapping and 5e-5 m tolerance
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **H4a Implementation:** Ported newvector = (close_distance/r_factor)*beam - pix0, then Fbeam/Sbeam = dot(fdet/sdet, newvector), distance_corrected = close_distance/r_factor

**Investigating output truncation and plan status**

I'm noticing the CLI or harness is truncating output after a certain point—likely to avoid huge dumps—and inserts a placeholder message that ironically says zero lines omitted. It’s tricky to get the full plan file content due to this, so I’m thinking of opening the plan directly with Python to see phases H and I clearly. Meanwhile, I’m aligning the vectorization plan and examining current phases and CLI flags to determine next steps and potential gaps.

**Investigating output truncation and next steps**

I'm puzzled by the CLI truncating output with a note about omitted lines—this might be a deliberate cutting to keep messages manageable. Given this, I think it’s best to capture only essential info and rely on the fix_plan details for the rest. Meanwhile, I’m planning to dive into `detector.py` around line 690 and use tools like `rg` to find and understand key functions like `custom_beam_vector` to prepare for deeper analysis. I'll also time the Python coin flip after completing initial debugging steps, following the prescribed sequence.

5:- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-06 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the CUSTOM pix0 transform; Phase H3b2/H3b3 now enforce the precedence rule (commit d6f158c) and the regression test captures both override paths. Residual geometry error persists: PyTorch still reports a +3.9 mm Y-offset between the C `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR` (−0.216476, 0.216343, −0.230192 m) and PyTorch output (−0.2125, 0.2190, −0.2302 m) when custom vectors are present. Evidence shows C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` from the post-rotation `pix0_vector` (see nanoBragg.c 1822–1860); replicating that workflow is the next blocker before Phase H4 parity.
6:- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

### Phase G — MOSFLM Matrix Orientation Support
Goal: Preserve full crystal orientation from `-mat` files so PyTorch matches C lattice vectors and downstream physics.
Prereqs: Detector parity (Phase F) achieved or at least traced; clarity on orientation data flow.
Exit Criteria: Crystal trace (rotated a/b/c vectors) aligns with C for the supervisor command; CLI accepts orientation without manual overrides.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Extend CLI config to retain A* vectors | [D] | ✅ Commit 28fc584 stores MOSFLM reciprocal vectors from `-mat` in `parse_and_validate_args` and threads them into `CrystalConfig`; 26-case CLI regression sweep captured in Attempt #15 notes. |
| G2 | Teach `Crystal` to ingest orientation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #17 (ralph). Modified `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors()` (lines 545-603) to detect MOSFLM orientation in config, convert to tensors with proper device/dtype, and integrate with Core Rules 12-13 pipeline. Tests: 26/26 passed (CLI), 35/35 passed (crystal). Metric duality perfect. Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/README.md`. |
| G3 | Trace verification + parity rerun | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #18 (ralph). Fixed MOSFLM matrix transpose bug (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/mosflm.py:88`). Reciprocal vectors now match C exactly (9/9 components to 16 decimals). Miller indices match: (2,2,-13). F_cell perfect match: 300.58. Real vectors within 0.05Å (<0.2% error). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation_fixed.md`, `traces/trace_c.log`, `traces/trace_py_fixed.log`. Intensity parity still divergent (deferred to Phase H polarization). |

### Phase H — Lattice Structure Factor Alignment
Goal: Ensure the CLI-provided beam vector propagates through Detector→Simulator and bring scattering/lattice parity back in line before polarization work.
Prereqs: Phases F and G complete; orientation traces captured (Phase G3 artifacts in place).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison shows `pix0_vector` components matching C within 5e-5 m, `h`, `k`, `l` fractional components within 1e-3, `F_latt_a/b/c` within 0.5% (signed), and a parity rerun demonstrates ≥0.95 correlation improvement attributable to lattice fixes (polarization still disabled).

Update 2025-10-17: Attempt #22 proved the projection-based override mapping pushes pix0 off by 2.16e-1 m; Attempt #23 shows the C code ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom detector vectors are present, so Phase H3b2 must enforce the precedence (custom vectors > pix0 override > standard calculation).

**Reviewing task status inconsistencies**

I’m noticing a mismatch between reported task completion in fix_plan and what the plan documents show, especially for H4 tasks. The plan looks outdated and might need updating to reflect completed work and next steps like polarization. There’s also work outstanding on polarization related to CLI flag parity and parallel command consistency. I plan to check debugging hypotheses and gather evidence from relevant files and logs to clarify remaining gaps and confirm the actual status of vectorization efforts.

## [ROUTING-LOOP-001] loop.sh routing guard
- Spec/AT: Prompt routing rules (prompts/meta.md)
- Priority: High
- Status: done (verified compliant 2025-10-01)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-01 (verification and completion)
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: `sed -n '1,80p' loop.sh`
  * PyTorch: n/a
  * Shapes/ROI: n/a
- First Divergence (if known): Commit `c49e3be` reverted the guard—`loop.sh` pipes `prompts/main.md` through `{1..40}` loop, removes `git pull --rebase`, and performs unconditional `git push`.
- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-13):
  * Run plan Phase A tasks (A1–A3) against commit `c49e3be` so the regression evidence references the latest violation, then confirm the current guarded script via Phase C compliance log before re-archiving the plan.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-12] Attempt #6 — Result: regression reopened. Detected commit `c49e3be` (loop.sh) restoring the 40-iteration `prompts/main.md` pipeline and stripping the timeouted `git pull --rebase`/conditional push added in `ffd9a5c`. No new audit artifacts captured; automation must stay paused until Phase A evidence is refreshed under `reports/routing/`.
    Metrics: n/a (manual inspection).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_planning (Phase A evidence outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions:
  1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A1–A3: author the reusable `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `absorption_baseline.py` harnesses, capture pytest + timing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, and record Attempt #1 in this entry.
  2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
  3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * (pending) — Capture Phase A baseline artifacts and update this log.
- Risks/Assumptions: Must maintain differentiability (no `.item()`, no `torch.linspace` with tensor bounds), preserve device/dtype neutrality (CPU/CUDA parity), and obey Protected Assets rule (all new scripts under `scripts/benchmarks/`). Large tensor indexing may increase memory pressure; ensure ROI caching still works.
- Exit Criteria (quote thresholds from spec):
  * specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 tricubic acceptance tests run without warnings and match C parity within documented tolerances (corr≥0.9995, ≤1e-12 structural duality where applicable).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

Update 2025-10-17: Attempt #22 proved the projection-based override mapping pushes pix0 off by 2.16e-1 m; Attempt #23 shows the C code ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom detector vectors are present, so Phase H3b2 must enforce the precedence (custom vectors > pix0 override > standard calculation).

| H2 | Fix incident beam propagation from CLI | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #20 (ralph). Simulator now clones `detector.beam_vector` (commit 8c1583d); regression covered by `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIBeamVector::test_custom_beam_vector_propagates`. Pending: rerun `phase_h/trace_harness.py` to confirm `incident_vec` parity before Phase H3. |
| H3a | Diagnose residual lattice mismatch | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #21 (ralph). `trace_py_after_H3_refresh.log`, `pix0_reproduction.md`, and `implementation_notes.md` quantify the ~1.14 mm pix0 delta and show the cascade into scattering vector and `F_latt` disparities; `attempt_log.txt` restored with evidence summary. |
| H3b1 | Capture C vs PyTorch pix0/F/S references (override on/off) | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #23: Stored paired C traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/c_trace_with_override.log` / `_without_override.log`), PyTorch traces, and `pix0_mapping_analysis.md`; evidence proves C geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are supplied. |
| H3b2 | Implement pix0 precedence (custom vectors > override) | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #24 (commit d6f158c). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now skips overrides when any custom detector vector is supplied; override logic only executes in the no-custom-vectors path. Validation: `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot` (CPU) and evidence log `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_override_validation.md`. Residual pix0 Y-delta (≈3.9 mm) traced to missing post-rotation `Fbeam/Sbeam` recomputation and deferred to H4. |
| H3b3 | Repair CLI regression + artifacts for precedence | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #24. Regression test now covers BOTH precedence cases (custom vectors ignored, standard path applies override) and records expected C pix0 vector in `pix0_expected.json`. CUDA parametrisation remains skipped until parity fix lands; tolerance temporarily relaxed to 5 mm pending H4 geometry alignment. |
| H4a | Port post-rotation beam-centre recomputation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #25: Ported nanoBragg.c lines 1846-1860 into `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector`; see `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/implementation.md`. |

| H4c | Tighten regression test + targeted pytest | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #25: Updated regression tolerance to 5e-5 m (CPU and CUDA parametrised) and captured `pytest_h4c.log`; Attempt #25 logged in docs/fix_plan.md. |

### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A/B/C2/D3/E/F1/F2/G1/G2/G3 ✅; Phase F3 parity rerun + Phases H–I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: Execute Phase H4 tasks in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (H4a) port the post-rotation `newvector` projection from nanoBragg.c 1822–1860 so CUSTOM pix0 derives `Fbeam/Sbeam` and refreshes `distance_corrected`; (H4b) regenerate C/PyTorch traces for the supervisor command (polarization disabled) and document pix0/`F_latt` deltas ≤5e-5 m under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/`; (H4c) tighten `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot` tolerances to ≤5e-5 m, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v`, and log Attempt #25 with metrics.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #25 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase H4a-c complete). **Post-rotation beam-centre recomputation implemented and verified.**
    Metrics: pix0_vector parity achieved - C vs PyTorch deltas < 2e-8 m (well within 5e-5 m tolerance). Test suite: test_cli_flags.py 23/23 passed, test_detector_geometry.py 12/12 passed, test_crystal_geometry.py 19/19 passed (54 total).
    Artifacts:

      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py:451-452,483-489,517-525` - Updated test with corrected beam_center mapping and 5e-5 m tolerance
    Observations/Hypotheses:

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: Drive Phase I in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (I1) audit polarization inputs vs nanoBragg.c 2080-2155, (I2) port the Kahn factor into the simulator with device/dtype neutrality, (I3) rerun the supervisor command with polarization enabled, archive logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/`, and record Attempt #26 with metrics.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #25 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase H4a-c complete). **Post-rotation beam-centre recomputation implemented and verified.**
    Metrics: pix0_vector parity achieved - C vs PyTorch deltas < 2e-8 m (well within 5e-5 m tolerance). Test suite: test_cli_flags.py 23/23 passed, test_detector_geometry.py 12/12 passed, test_crystal_geometry.py 19/19 passed (54 total).
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:692-726` - Ported nanoBragg.c lines 1851-1860
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/` - Implementation notes, parity summary, C/PyTorch traces
      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py:451-452,483-489,517-525` - Updated test with corrected beam_center mapping and 5e-5 m tolerance
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **H4a Implementation:** Ported newvector = (close_distance/r_factor)*beam - pix0, then Fbeam/Sbeam = dot(fdet/sdet, newvector), distance_corrected = close_distance/r_factor

      - Root cause: `_calculate_pix0_vector()` instantiated convention-default beam vectors at lines 439-450 and 530-548, bypassing `self.beam_vector` property that honors CUSTOM overrides
      - Fix: Two edits—(1) r-factor calculation now uses `self.beam_vector` directly; (2) BEAM pivot branch reuses same `beam_vector` variable instead of re-instantiating
      - Beam vector fix complete (CLI `-beam_vector` now drives r-factor and pix0 calculations)
      - Remaining pix0 discrepancy (~0.84mm Y) indicates Phase F2 (CUSTOM pix0 transform) still needed per plan
    Next Actions: Execute plan Phase F2 (port CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1730-1860), then Phase F3 parity rerun. After F2 complete, pix0 should match C within ≤1e-12 and geometry correlation should exceed 0.999.
    Next Actions: Update plan Phase E guidance to document beam-vector evidence (done) and prioritize implementation work that (1) threads `custom_beam_vector` into Detector/BeamConfig while preserving differentiability and device/dtype neutrality, and (2) re-runs Phase E traces to confirm both pix0 and beam vectors match before reattempting parity.
  * [2025-10-16] Attempt #7 (ralph) — Result: Phase E0 complete (evidence captured). Beam-vector divergence confirmed.
    Metrics: PyTorch beam_vector = `tensor([0., 0., 1.], dtype=torch.float64)` (CUSTOM/XDS default); C log reports user-supplied `-beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986`. Confirms CLI parser stores but does not thread `custom_beam_vector` through to detector instantiation.
    Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/beam_vector_check.txt` (1 line: PyTorch beam_vector output).
    Observations/Hypotheses: CLI successfully parsed all flags including `-beam_vector`, `-pix0_vector_mm`, `-convention CUSTOM` inputs, but `Detector.__init__` ignores `custom_beam_vector` from config and falls back to convention defaults. This is the second geometry gap alongside the pix0 transform issue documented in Attempt #5 (Phase E). Running the evidence harness also created a duplicate copy of the structure-factor file (`scaled.hkl.1`, identical to `scaled.hkl`) in the repo root; treat it as an artefact that needs removal during the upcoming implementation pass so repo hygiene stays intact.
    Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase E tasks E1-E3 to generate full C/PyTorch traces with this configuration; (2) Implement detector fix to accept and use `custom_beam_vector` from config while maintaining differentiability/device-neutrality (documented in detector.md §5); (3) Re-run beam_vector_check to verify alignment before parity retry; (4) Delete the stray `scaled.hkl.1` artefact once the investigation concludes (confirm prior to Protected Assets scan).
  * [2025-10-05] Attempt #8 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase E1-E3 complete). **Crystal lattice orientation bug discovered as primary root cause.**
    Metrics: C pix0_vector = `-0.21648, 0.21634, -0.23019`; PyTorch pix0_vector = `-0.21634, 0.21521, -0.23020` (1.14 mm Y-axis error). C incident_beam = `0.000513879 0 -0.999999868` matches PyTorch `0.00051387949 0 -0.99999986` ✓. **CRITICAL:** C crystal vectors are fully populated triclinic (from A.mat file); PyTorch vectors are upper-triangular canonical form (default orientation), indicating A.mat not loaded or not applied.

## Objective
Verify that Phase H4a implementation (post-rotation beam-centre recomputation) achieves pix0_vector parity with C code.

## Test Configuration
- CUSTOM convention with custom detector vectors
- No pix0_vector_mm override (custom vectors take precedence per H3b2)
- Polarization disabled (-nopolar)
- Command parameters from trace_harness.py (wavelength 0.9768 Å, N=36×47×29, etc.)

**Analyzing polarization default mismatch and planning next steps**

I'm piecing together that the polarization factor defaults differ between PyTorch (0.0) and C code (1.0), causing mismatched results. I’m outlining hypotheses about default polarization factors, orientation axes, and CLI parsing quirks. The plan involves aligning these defaults, verifying parity via tests, and setting clear task focus in `input.md` with references to specific files and issue IDs for implementation. I'll also confirm the current git branch to include in the instructions.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:94 spells out Phase H4a–H4c requirements; H4a specifically demands mirroring nanoBragg.c lines 1846-1860 and logging notes in parity_after_lattice_fix/implementation.md.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 keeps CLI-FLAGS-003 top priority and lists H4a/H4b/H4c as next actions; the Attempt #25 entry must cite new metrics once traces land.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_mapping_analysis.md captures the current 3.9 mm Y delta; use it as the before/after reference in parity_after_lattice_fix/summary.md.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:70 reiterates BEAM pivot mappings (Fbeam←Ybeam, Sbeam←Xbeam with MOSFLM +0.5) that must still hold after recomputation.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1822-1859 is the authoritative sequence (newvector projection + updated distance); keep ordering identical to avoid sign or offset drift.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:210 describes pix0, r-factor, and close-distance relationships; the PyTorch update should satisfy those invariants and log them in traces.
How-To Map:
- Export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE for every Python/pytest run; set NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg when capturing C traces.
- Study nanoBragg.c:1822-1859 to note how `newvector = close_distance/ratio * beam - pix0` is formed before projecting to F/S axes.
- Edit src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py around lines 520-620; after computing `self.pix0_vector`, recompute `close_distance_tensor = torch.dot(self.pix0_vector, self.odet_vec)` and `beam_term = close_distance_tensor / self.r_factor * beam_vector` using tensor ops on the detector device/dtype.
- Form `newvector = beam_term - self.pix0_vector`, set `Fbeam_recomputed = -torch.dot(newvector, self.fdet_vec)` and `Sbeam_recomputed = -torch.dot(newvector, self.sdet_vec)`, then refresh `self.beam_center_f/s` respecting MOSFLM's ±0.5 pixel offset.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:119 keeps Phase I (I1–I3) as the remaining blocker before the supervisor command can run end-to-end.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 records CLI-FLAGS-003 status and now calls for Attempt #26 focused on polarization; our evidence must flow back there.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308 shows C default polar=1.0, while src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 hardcodes 0.0 — this delta drives the parity miss.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:72 stresses device/dtype neutrality, so the new polarization path must avoid CPU-only tensors.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1 (AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC) requires targeted pytest nodes; use it to justify the commands listed here.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md documents C vs PyTorch polarization divergence (~0.9126 vs 1.0) to regress against after the fix.
How-To Map:
- Set AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=docs/development/testing_strategy.md for reference.
- Adjust BeamConfig defaults in src/nanobrag_torch/config.py so polarization_factor mirrors nanoBragg.c (default 1.0) and ensure CLI "'`-polar`/`-nopolar` override logic survives.
- Audit simulator initialization (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:485) to verify kahn_factor and polarization_axis come from BeamConfig without `.item()`; update if needed to keep tensor flow.
- Add CLI regression in tests/test_cli_flags.py (e.g., class TestCLIPolarization) that runs the supervisor command args with/without `-polar` and checks reported `polar` trace matches C within 5e-5.
- After implementation, regenerate traces via reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --mode polarization (no --no-polar) and store outputs, diffs, and a summary under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/.
- Run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity -v, then env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_parallel_011.py::TestATParallel011PolarizationFactor::test_polarized_kahn_model -v to ensure broader polarization coverage.
- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts History (Attempt #26) with metrics (polar factor, correlation) and link to phase_i summary before closing the loop.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave BeamConfig defaults at 0.0; parity requires matching C’s polar=1.0 baseline.
- Avoid using `.item()` or creating CPU-only tensors when computing polarization factors; keep torch ops differentiable.
- Keep the Protected Assets rule in mind — no edits to files listed in docs/index.md outside sanctioned updates.
- Do not rerun full pytest; limit to the mapped nodes plus evidence scripts.
- Ensure CLI still honors -nopolar by zeroing kahn_factor and updating tests accordingly.
- Preserve existing multi-source/vectorized behavior in polarization_factor; no scalar fallbacks or per-pixel loops.
- Maintain KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE for every Python/pytest invocation to avoid MKL clashes.
- Document all new evidence in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/ before updating fix_plan.
- Keep tolerance thresholds consistent with specs (≤5e-5 for traces); no silent loosening.
- Remember CUSTOM detector offsets remain zero; don’t reintroduce MOSFLM +0.5 when polarization toggles.
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:119 — Phase I task table (I1–I3).
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — CLI-FLAGS-003 ledger entry and Attempt #25 summary.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308 — default polar / polarization variable initialization.
- src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 — current BeamConfig polarization defaults.
- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:485 — kahn_factor and polarization_axis setup.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md — baseline polarization divergence to beat.
Next Up: 1) If Phase I lands early, rerun nb-compare for the supervisor command with polarization enabled; 2) Prep vectorization Phase A baseline capture (plans/active/vectorization.md) once CLI parity closes.

- After implementation, regenerate traces via reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --mode polarization (no --no-polar) and store outputs, diffs, and a summary under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/.
- Run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity -v, then env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_parallel_011.py::TestATParallel011PolarizationFactor::test_polarized_kahn_model -v to ensure broader polarization coverage.
- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts History (Attempt #26) with metrics (polar factor, correlation) and link to phase_i summary before closing the loop.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave BeamConfig defaults at 0.0; parity requires matching C’s polar=1.0 baseline.
- Avoid using `.item()` or creating CPU-only tensors when computing polarization factors; keep torch ops differentiable.
- Keep the Protected Assets rule in mind — no edits to files listed in docs/index.md outside sanctioned updates.
- Do not rerun full pytest; limit to the mapped nodes plus evidence scripts.
- Ensure CLI still honors -nopolar by zeroing kahn_factor and updating tests accordingly.
- Preserve existing multi-source/vectorized behavior in polarization_factor; no scalar fallbacks or per-pixel loops.
- Maintain KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE for every Python/pytest invocation to avoid MKL clashes.
- Document all new evidence in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/ before updating fix_plan.
- Keep tolerance thresholds consistent with specs (≤5e-5 for traces); no silent loosening.
- Remember CUSTOM detector offsets remain zero; don’t reintroduce MOSFLM +0.5 when polarization toggles.
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:119 — Phase I task table (I1–I3).
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — CLI-FLAGS-003 ledger entry and Attempt #25 summary.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308 — default polar / polarization variable initialization.
- src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 — current BeamConfig polarization defaults.
- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:485 — kahn_factor and polarization_axis setup.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md — baseline polarization divergence to beat.
Next Up: 1) If Phase I lands early, rerun nb-compare for the supervisor command with polarization enabled; 2) Prep vectorization Phase A baseline capture (plans/active/vectorization.md) once CLI parity closes.

Phase: Implementation
Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase I polarization)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity | tests/test_at_parallel_011.py::TestATParallel011PolarizationFactor::test_polarized_kahn_model
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase I polarization — author targeted CLI polarization parity test, then run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity -v
If Blocked: Capture evidence via KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --mode polarization --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/blocked && log findings in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/blocked.md before paging supervisor.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:119 keeps Phase I (I1–I3) as the final blocker before the supervisor command can run end-to-end; we must execute those tasks in order.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:108 explains the Phase H evidence we are building on; reference it when contrasting polarization results.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 records CLI-FLAGS-003 status now waiting for Attempt #26 focused on polarization; evidence must flow back to this ledger entry.
- docs/fix_plan.md:859 updates exit criteria with Phase H marked ✅, so polarization alignment is the only unfinished milestone.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308 shows C default polar=1.0 and polarization=0.0; PyTorch currently defaults to 0.0, causing the observed 0.9126 vs 1.0 divergence.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3245-3290 documents the polarization_factor helper; match its tensor equivalent when validating gradients.
- src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 hardcodes polarization_factor=0.0; adjust it to 1.0 while respecting "'`nopolar`.
- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:485 pulls kahn_factor from BeamConfig; ensure dtype/device neutrality survives the change.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:72 emphasizes tensor neutrality and forbids `.cpu()`/`.item()` inside hot paths; keep that guardrail during edits.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1 (AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC) mandates precise pytest selectors; cite it when recording Do Now and verification steps.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md details the current polarization mismatch (~0.9126 vs 1.0) and should be the “before” snapshot we overwrite.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/summary.md confirms pix0 parity with `-nopolar`; we now need a complementary summary with polarization enabled.
How-To Map:
- Set AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=docs/development/testing_strategy.md in your shell so any future reference to test commands stays grounded.
- Inspect nanoBragg defaults by running `rg -n "polar=" golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` and document key lines in phase_i/notes.md for traceability.
- Update BeamConfig defaults in src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 so `polarization_factor` initializes to 1.0, matching C; retain the docstring comment explaining the new default.
- Confirm CLI parsing still honors `-polar` and `-nopolar` by reviewing src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:240-308; add assertions as necessary to keep `args.polar` optional.
- Audit simulator initialization at src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:470-520 to ensure kahn_factor remains a tensor on the detector device/dtype; avoid scalar intermediates.
- Examine polarization_factor implementation in src/nanobrag_torch/utils/physics.py:183-236; cross-check unit vector normalization matches the C reference.
- Enhance tests/test_cli_flags.py by adding a new class (e.g., TestCLIPolarization) with fixtures that run the supervisor command args via CLI harness, capturing `TRACE_PY: polar` values.
- Use the harness at reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py with `--mode polarization` (drop `--no-polar`) to produce PyTorch traces stored under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/trace_py.log.
- Generate matching C traces with `timeout 180 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/c_reference_runner.py --config prompts/supervisor_command.yaml --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/trace_c.log` (verify config file path beforehand).
- Diff traces using `PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/diff_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/trace_c.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/trace_py.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/trace_diff.log` and highlight the polarization line.
- Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/summary.md with a table showing C vs PyTorch polarization factors, correlated intensities, and any residual delta (target ≤5e-5 absolute).
- Run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity -v once the new test exists; archive the log as phase_i/pytest_cli_polar.log.
- Follow up with env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_parallel_011.py::TestATParallel011PolarizationFactor::test_polarized_kahn_model -v to make sure broader polarization physics stays valid; store output in phase_i/pytest_parallel_011.log.
- Record Attempt #26 in docs/fix_plan.md with polarization metrics (traces, correlation, intensity ratio) and cross-link the new summary.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave BeamConfig default at 0.0; failing to bump it to 1.0 recreates the very regression we are closing.
- Avoid introducing `.item()` calls when logging polarization; maintain differentiability through the simulator.
- Remember to propagate device/dtype neutrality — any new tensors must use `type_as` or `.to(self.device, self.dtype)`.
- Do not modify Protected Assets listed in docs/index.md; confine updates to targeted source, tests, and reports.
- Resist running full pytest; stick to the mapped nodes to conserve time and follow testing_strategy.md guidance.
- Ensure `-nopolar` still zeroes the Kahn factor; add regression coverage so the flag continues to work post-change.
- Keep multi-source polarization paths vectorized (no Python loops) when editing simulator or utils modules.
- Maintain trace formatting (TRACE_PY / TRACE_C prefixes) to keep diff tooling consistent.
- Archive every artifact under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/ with descriptive filenames; missing evidence blocks supervisor sign-off.
- Update plan and fix-plan references after producing artifacts; stale metadata causes routing drift.
- Preserve MOSFLM vs CUSTOM offsets: polarization changes must not reintroduce +0.5 pixel adjustments in CUSTOM mode.
- Keep KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE on every Python/pytest invocation or MKL conflicts will crash the loop.

[2025-10-06T09:28:15] bash -lc 'tail -n 40 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 712ms:
- Authored new input.md directing Ralph to gather paired C/Py traces, stash logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`, and summarise deltas in `pix0_mapping_analysis.md` before touching detector code.
- Follow-up for Ralph next loop: execute H3b1 evidence capture (both NB_C_BIN and Py harness runs, override on/off), document findings, then proceed to H3b2 using measured relationships.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H3b2 readiness)
- Reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 status; confirmed Attempt #23 evidence proves C ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors present, leaving 1.14 mm pix0 Y delta from PyTorch.
- Updated plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase H3b: marked H3b1 complete, rewrote H3b2/H3b3 guidance to enforce precedence (custom vectors > override) and to adjust regression test expectations.
- Regenerated input.md (100 lines) directing Ralph to implement the precedence fix, update tests/test_cli_flags.py, capture artifacts under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/, and log Attempt #24.
- No code changes performed; repo remains clean aside from plan/input updates.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: execute H3b2 implementation + H3b3 regression rewrite, rerun targeted pytest node, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log with metrics, and stash validation artifacts before moving to Phase H4.
## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H4 prep)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed required docs and active plans.
- Phase analysis: CLI parity still blocked by +3.9 mm pix0 Y delta despite H3b2 precedence fix; vectorization plan untouched (Phase A evidence pending).
- Coin flip = heads → reviewed Ralph’s last iterations (commits 5a9a9ea, d6f158c, 60852bb). Precedence implementation productive but regression test currently tolerates 5 mm delta — flagged for tightening post-fix.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context + Phase H3b2/H3b3 entries to reflect completion and refocused H4 guidance on C beam-centre recomputation. Synced docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions and refreshed pix0_mapping_analysis.md checklist.
- Authored new input.md (100 lines) directing Ralph to port C’s post-rotation Fbeam/Sbeam recomputation, rerun traces, tighten pytest tolerances, and archive artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/`.
- Reminder for next loop: verify H4 implementation lands, tighten test tolerance to ≤5e-5 m, capture Attempt #25 evidence. Vectorization plan remains frozen until CLI parity cleared.
## 2025-10-17 (galph loop — H4 decomposition)
- Coin flip → tails; skipped retrospective commit audit per instructions.
- Deep-dive vs long-term goals: Goal 1 still blocked by pix0 parity; traced 1.14 mm Y delta to missing post-rotation `newvector` projection and stale `distance_corrected` updates in `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:326`. Goal 2 (vectorization) unchanged—Phase A evidence pending once CLI parity unblocks bandwidth.
- Debugging hypotheses documented for Ralph: (1) Absence of C’s `newvector` recomputation keeps Fbeam/Sbeam stale (highest confidence; next step is to port nanoBragg.c:1822-1859). (2) `distance_corrected` not refreshed after recompute may subtly skew downstream geometry—verify once H4a lands. (3) Beam-centre tensors may retain MOSFLM offsets under CUSTOM; confirm during implementation. Highest-confidence path is hypothesis #1 with direct code port as confirming step.

I'll include line-number citations using `nl` to make references precise and mention the authoritative commands doc for testing strategy.

     1	## Context
     2	- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
     3	- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
     4	- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
     5	- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
     6	- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
     7	
     8	### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
     9	Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
    10	Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
    11	Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.
    12	
    13	| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    14	| --- | --- | --- | --- |
    15	| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
    16	| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
    17	| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |
    18	
    19	### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
    20	Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

Validation: `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot` (CPU) and evidence log `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_override_validation.md`. Residual pix0 Y-delta (≈3.9 mm) traced to missing post-rotation `Fbeam/Sbeam` recomputation and deferred to H4. |
   105	| H3b3 | Repair CLI regression + artifacts for precedence | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #24.

CUDA parametrisation remains skipped until parity fix lands; tolerance temporarily relaxed to 5 mm pending H4 geometry alignment. |

   108	| H4c | Tighten regression test + targeted pytest | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #25: Updated regression tolerance to 5e-5 m (CPU and CUDA parametrised) and captured `pytest_h4c.log`; Attempt #25 logged in docs/fix_plan.md. |
   109	
   110	### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
   111	Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
   112	Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
   113	Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

   450	- Priority: High
   451	- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
   452	- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
   453	- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
   454	- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   455	  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   456	  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
   457	- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
   458	- Next Actions: Drive Phase I in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (I1) audit polarization inputs vs nanoBragg.c 2080-2155, (I2) port the Kahn factor into the simulator with device/dtype neutrality, (I3) rerun the supervisor command with polarization enabled, archive logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/`, and record Attempt #26 with metrics.

   835	      - The detector.beam_vector property already handled both CUSTOM overrides and convention defaults correctly

**Summarizing final response structure**

I’m organizing the final answer to include clear sections with concise bullet points referencing files and line numbers. I’ll summarize analysis, list hypotheses with evidence, mention plan updates, highlight progress blockers for vectorization, and provide clear next steps and instructions referencing `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC`. This way, the user gets a structured, thorough overview matching the desired style.

     1	## Context
     2	- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
     3	- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
     4	- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
     5	
     6	### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
     7	Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
     8	Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
     9	Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.
    10	
    11	| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    12	| --- | --- | --- | --- |
    13	| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
    14	| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
    15	| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |
    16	
    17	### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
    18	Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
    19	Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
    20	Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

     2	Phase: Implementation
     3	Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase I polarization)
     4	Branch: feature/spec-based-2
     5	Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity | tests/test_at_parallel_011.py::TestATParallel011PolarizationFactor::test_polarized_kahn_model

     7	Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase I polarization — author targeted CLI polarization parity test, then run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity -v
     8	If Blocked: Capture evidence via KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --mode polarization --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/blocked && log findings in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/blocked.md before paging supervisor.
     9	Priorities & Rationale:
    10	- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:119 keeps Phase I (I1–I3) as the final blocker; follow each task sequentially.
    11	  - Re-read Phase I goal statement to ensure the CLI command parity criteria are satisfied before closing the plan.
    12	- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:108 summarises Phase H artifacts; reuse those traces as baseline when comparing polarization on/off.
    13	  - The parity_after_lattice_fix summary proves geometry parity with -nopolar, which Phase I artifacts must extend.
    14	- docs/fix_plan.md:448 records CLI-FLAGS-003 status now waiting for Attempt #26; evidence must update this ledger entry with polarization metrics.
    15	  - Note the updated Next Actions already reference Phase I, so deliverables must target polarization.
    16	- docs/fix_plan.md:859 highlights exit criteria with Phase H marked complete; only polarization and nb-compare remain unchecked.
    17	  - Ensure Attempt #26 flips those ❌ entries to ✅.
    18	- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308 shows C defaults polar=1.0/polarization=0.0; mismatched PyTorch defaults explain the ~0.09 trace gap.
    19	  - Keep this reference handy when writing Attempt #26 notes or commit message.
    20	- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3254-3290 documents polarization_factor; mirror its vector math when verifying tensor implementation.

**Composing structured final response**

I'll organize the final message into clear sections: Findings, Hypotheses with evidence and next steps, Actions Taken summarizing updates, and Next Steps referencing input instructions and authoritative docs, all with relevant path-line references.
[2025-10-06T09:29:45] codex

**Findings**
- CLI parity plan now highlights polarization as the lone blocker after H4 closure (plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:5,106-119); Phase I tasks I1–I3 remain open.
- Fix ledger steers Attempt #26 toward polarization evidence, with Phases A–H marked complete and exit criterion (xi) closed (docs/fix_plan.md:448-459,859).
- Root cause for the remaining disparity: PyTorch still defaults `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` to 0.0 while nanoBragg.c initializes `polar=1.0` (src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 vs golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308).
- Vectorization initiative is untouched; Phase A baseline capture and benchmark scripts are still `[ ]` across the table (plans/active/vectorization.md:1-35).

**Hypotheses**
1. PyTorch’s default Kahn factor (0.0) is suppressing polarization relative to nanoBragg’s 1.0 default, producing the observed 0.9126 vs 1.0 trace gap. Evidence: src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483 vs golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308. Confidence: High. Next check: update the default to 1.0, rerun the supervisor command via the new CLI test, and confirm traces/logs match within ≤5e-5.
2. The polarization axis for CUSTOM geometry may not mirror the C workflow; PyTorch keeps `(0,0,1)` (src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:485, src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:990-1008) while nanoBragg derives E/B vectors from the actual beam direction (golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3254-3290). Confidence: Medium. Next check: capture C/PyTorch traces with polarization enabled and compare axis components; adjust CLI beam setup if misaligned.
3. Trace harness defaults still emphasize `--no-polar` (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/summary.md) which could mask regressions during Phase I. Confidence: Medium. Next check: run `trace_harness.py --mode polarization` and ensure the logs include `TRACE_PY: polar` values before attempting parity sign-off.

**Actions Taken**
- Refreshed CLI-FLAGS-003 plan snapshot and marked H4a–H4c complete with Attempt #25 artifacts (plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:5,104-108).
- Updated fix plan to call for Attempt #26 polarization work and documented Phase H completion (docs/fix_plan.md:451-470,859).
- Authored a 101-line supervisor briefing that targets Phase I, references AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=docs/development/testing_strategy.md, and prescribes evidence/report locations (input.md:1-101).
- Logged decisions in galph_memory.md, staged/committed/pushed `SUPERVISOR: Phase I polarization staging - tests: not run`.

**Next Steps**
- Ralph should follow input.md: run Phase I audit/implementation/parity tasks, add the CLI polarization regression, capture traces under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/, and log Attempt #26 in docs/fix_plan.md.
- After polarization parity lands, rerun nb-compare for the supervisor command, then pivot to vectorization Phase A baselines per plans/active/vectorization.md.
