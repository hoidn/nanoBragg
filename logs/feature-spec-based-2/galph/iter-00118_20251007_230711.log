in order of decreasing priority:
<1>
run a successful parallel test of pytorch nanobragg against nanobragg c with this command:

nanoBragg  -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl  -nonoise  -nointerpolate -oversample 1  -exposure 1  -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0  -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080  -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866  -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986  -Na 36  -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0

this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

**Preparing deep codebase analysis**

I'll dive into the relevant documentation and plans to understand how to support new CLI flags and check for related bugs, especially focusing on the plans around noise and vectorization features. This will help me shape a solid approach aligned with the long-term goals.

[2025-10-07T23:07:55] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md' succeeded in 681ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Spec alignment note (2025-11-26): `specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214` states φ sampling SHALL follow `phi = phi0 + phistep * tic` with no state carryover. Keep the C-side defect recorded in `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` (§C-PARITY-001) quarantined to parity harnesses; do not promote it to the normative spec or default PyTorch behavior. Track that `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1097-1198` currently caches `_phi_last_cache` to emulate C; the remediation plan must either remove or gate this behavior behind an explicit parity toggle once CLI validation is unblocked.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-23 PM): Attempt #109 regenerated the TRACE_C_PHI log under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/` and re-ran `compare_per_phi_traces.py`; Δk now measures 1.8116e-2 at φ_tic=0 while φ≥1 stay within 2.85e-5, confirming the carryover mismatch and leaving VG-1 blocked until the remediation lands.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-26): Attempts #111 and #113 produced per-φ traces with max Δk=2.845e-05. This still exceeds the VG-1 gate (Δk, Δb_y ≤ 1e-6). Treat those commits as partial progress until fresh traces prove the tighter tolerance.
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**

[2025-10-07T23:07:58] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/vectorization.md' succeeded in 666ms:
## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-11-27): Phases A–C complete with gather vectorization merged (commit 12742e5). Polynomial helpers still scalar; detector absorption remains looped. Phase D is the active gate before parity/perf validation (Phase E) and absorption work (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2355-2368` — rehydrates the cached structure factors silently.

**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel’s final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-26 refresh → galph loop i=112, amended 2025-11-27):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.3 (lock spec φ=0 baselines)** — Attempt #115 merged the spec-compliant rotation, but VG-1 remains open because k_frac still uses a "differs-from-C" guard. Capture fresh per-φ traces with the new implementation, record the spec targets (rot_b_y=0.7173197865 Å, k_frac=1.6756687164) in `comparison_summary.md`, update `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to assert those values with ≤1e-6 tolerances, and regenerate `delta_metrics.json` showing max Δk, Δb_y ≤1e-6 on CPU+CUDA before advancing.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (parity shim design)** — After the default path matches the spec, add an opt-in carryover mode for parity harnesses. Document the toggle in `diagnosis.md`, cite `specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214` and `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204`, and capture evidence that the shim reproduces the C trace without affecting the default run.
3. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (docs/tests refresh)** — Revise `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py`, `mosflm_matrix_correction.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` so default assertions target the spec values while parity cases sit behind the new shim. Store collect-only and targeted pytest logs showing both selectors discovered.
4. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-21] Attempt #95 (galph supervisor loop) — Result: **PLANNING UPDATE** (Phase L3k added). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Planning-only (no tests executed).
    Artifacts:

**Analyzing task status inconsistencies**

I'm trying to untangle conflicting attempt results showing earlier successes but current next actions still pending, possibly due to tasks being reopened or regressions. I’m focusing on gathering evidence from specs and bug docs to clarify the immediate action, which is locking the spec baseline for Phase L3k.3c.3, and planning to compile a detailed instruction set without code changes. I'll review existing documentation and prepare an input.md update for Ralph to proceed confidently.

Summary: Capture spec φ=0 baselines (rot_b_y, k_frac) and tighten VG-1 checks before parity shim work
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / L3k.3c.3 lock spec φ=0 baselines
Branch: feature/spec-based-2

Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 L3k.3c.3 — env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity -v
If Blocked: Run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/collect_only.log, log current k_frac/rot_b outputs from the harness in diagnosis.md, and pause for supervisor guidance

Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 — φ sampling must rotate the reference cell freshly each step; spec values (rot_b_y, k_frac) are normative
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 — C-PARITY-001 stays quarantined behind the future shim; default tests must no longer rely on the buggy plateau
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:288-313 — L3k.3/L3k.3c.3 now require capturing spec baselines and proving ≤1e-6 deltas before nb-compare
- docs/fix_plan.md:450-464 — Next Actions call for recording rot_b_y=0.7173197865 Å, k_frac=1.6756687164 and updating pytest expectations accordingly
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251007154213/comparison_summary.md — Source of the current spec numbers; use it to confirm new captures match prior evidence
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md:116-353 — Memo spells out VG-1 tolerances and trace workflow; keep it synchronized with new artifacts
- tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py:25-273 — Active assertions need to shift from “differs from C” to spec constants with tight tolerances
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md:15-56 — VG checklist records pass/fail state; update rows with new timestamps once ≤1e-6 is demonstrated
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4 — Reinforces CPU+CUDA smoke expectations; apply when running targeted pytest after edits
- CLAUDE.md Core Implementation Rules (Rule 11 & 13) — Keep C-code references intact and ensure reciprocal/real recalculation stays metrically consistent while editing

      - Removed `_phi_last_cache` mechanism completely per specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 (fresh rotation each φ step)
      - Default path now applies identity rotation at φ=0, yielding base vectors (0.71732 Å) instead of C buggy stale carryover (0.671588 Å)

**Analyzing attempt history and code status**

The attempt history is quite tangled with duplicates and multiple loops, making it tough to parse. I'm curious about the apparent success at attempt #116 despite outstanding tasks still showing in the Next Actions—this might be due to reopening after reintroducing bugs. To clarify, I want to check if the spec fix remains intact and whether the current code is compliant by examining the relevant source code, especially in `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py`, focusing on `_phi_last_cache` removal and rotation changes.

**Planning verification and documentation update**

I'm organizing the next steps to verify that the phi rotation implementation matches the spec by collecting evidence from specs, bug docs, plans, and tests. I’m preparing to draft detailed instructions and summaries for updating `input.md` with precise commands for targeted tests on CPU and GPU, including capturing per-φ traces to confirm compliance. Before editing, I’ll gather all necessary details like spec references and script paths to ensure clear, actionable guidance.

Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 require identity rotation at φ=0, so rot_b_y and k_frac must match the recorded spec constants
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 shows the C carryover defect; default PyTorch path must stay spec-clean until the parity shim lands
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:309 keeps L3k.3c.3 open until ≤1e-6 deltas are documented on CPU (and CUDA when available)
- docs/fix_plan.md:461-468 lists rot_b_y=0.7173197865 Å and k_frac=1.6756687164 as the targets to log in comparison_summary.md and delta_metrics.json
- tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py:25-273 already assert the spec values; rerunning them proves the simulator still hits those baselines post-refactor
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md:116-353 defines VG-1 evidence expectations you must fulfil before touching parity shims

- Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md and fix_checklist.md with the new timestamp, metrics, and pass/fail gate notes before logging the Attempt

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not reintroduce the C carryover shortcut into the default path; keep the shim work gated under L3k.3c.4
- Keep tensor ops vectorised; no per-step Python loops or `.item()` inside differentiable flows
- Honour device/dtype neutrality: never stash CPU tensors when running the CUDA harness
- Preserve Protected Assets (docs/index.md listings) when copying or archiving artifacts
- Capture traces with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set before importing torch to avoid MKL crashes
- Avoid regenerating C traces unless absolutely required; reuse the 202510070839 log noted above
- Do not alter plan status markers until VG-1 evidence is recorded and cross-linked in docs/fix_plan.md

Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 mandate φ=0 identity rotation, so rot_b_y and k_frac must be recorded against the 0.7173197865 Å and 1.6756687164 targets
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 isolates the nanoBragg C carryover defect; keeping PyTorch default spec-compliant is non-negotiable until the shim exists
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:288-320 leaves L3k.3c.3 open until CPU (and CUDA) traces show ≤1e-6 deltas plus refreshed pytest evidence
- docs/fix_plan.md:450-520 calls for updated comparison_summary.md, delta_metrics.json, and checklist rows before advancing to parity shim tasks
- tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py:25-273 already assert the spec baselines; passing them confirms the simulator still honors the spec after recent merges
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md:116-353 enumerates VG gates and artifact expectations you must satisfy this loop
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4 enforces CPU+CUDA smoke coverage for tensor math edits; cite it when logging the Attempt metadata
- CLAUDE.md Rule 13 (metric duality) and Rule 11 (C reference docstrings) remain in force; do not regress the cross-product recalculation while gathering evidence
- galph_memory.md latest entry reiterates that the shim work is deferrable; respect the standing decision to finish L3k.3c.3 before new implementation
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/fix_checklist.md entries VG-1.1–VG-1.4 still marked pending; your artifacts should let you tick them

How-To Map:
- export TS="reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)" && mkdir -p "$TS" && printf "timestamp=%s'"\\n\" \""'$TS" >> ${TS}/metadata.txt
- cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/config_snapshot.json ${TS}/config_snapshot.json to capture the supervisor command parameters used for this run
- Ensure editable import path and MKL guard: export PYTHONPATH=src; export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE; verify `which nanoBragg` points to the editable install before running harnesses
- KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --out ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector.log --device cpu --dtype float32 | tee ${TS}/trace_harness_cpu.log
- Verify trace_harness exit code and file sizes; if trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json is missing, rerun with --emit-per-phi to regenerate the JSON payload expected by compare_per_phi_traces.py
- KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/202510070839/c_trace_phi_202510070839.log > ${TS}/comparison_stdout.txt
- jq '"'.per_phi_entries' "'${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json > ${TS}/per_phi_entries.json to document the raw values before summarising deltas
- python scripts/summarise_phi_deltas.py ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json --out ${TS}/delta_metrics.json (script lives beside compare_per_phi_traces.py; run `python scripts/summarise_phi_deltas.py -h` if unsure)

- env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_k_frac_phi0_matches_c -v | tee ${TS}/pytest_k_frac.log
- cat ${TS}/pytest_rot_b.log ${TS}/pytest_k_frac.log > ${TS}/pytest_phi0.log to simplify fix_plan references; record CPU runtime in metadata.txt
- If CUDA is available, rerun the harness with --device cuda --dtype float32, store outputs as ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_cuda.log and delta_metrics_cuda.json, and capture pytest logs with `pytest -k TestPhiZeroParity --device cuda`
- Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md with a new section summarising metrics, referencing ${TS}/delta_metrics*.json and the pytest logs
- Mark VG-1 entries in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md as complete with timestamp, device, and delta figures; include both CPU and CUDA rows when applicable
- Append Attempt details to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (rot_b delta, k_frac delta, pytest runtimes), artifact paths (TS folder), and confirmation that Next Actions move to L3k.3c.4

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not reintroduce `_phi_last_cache` or any cached φ state in production code while collecting evidence
- Avoid hard-coding CPU tensors when running CUDA validation; use `.to(device)` based on harness arguments
- Never touch docs/index.md assets when creating timestamp folders; keep all outputs under reports/...
- Skip nb-compare or normalization reruns; focus strictly on per-φ baselines this loop
- Do not loosen pytest tolerances; maintain abs=1e-6 assertions in tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
- Keep harness RNG seeds stable; do not modify mosaic seed inputs while capturing traces
- Confirm NB_C_BIN still points to golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg before invoking compare_per_phi_traces.py so the C trace reference remains valid
- Capture SHA256 hashes with `shasum -a 256 ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector.log > ${TS}/sha256.txt` to make future audits replicable
- Log CUDA availability in metadata.txt to clarify skipped GPU runs if hardware is absent
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE is exported before importing torch inside ad-hoc shells or scripts

- Log CUDA availability in metadata.txt to clarify skipped GPU runs if hardware is absent
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE is exported before importing torch inside ad-hoc shells or scripts
- Do not delete historical timestamp folders; new evidence should be additive for auditability
- Avoid editing plan status markers prematurely; update plans/active and fix_plan only after the evidence is stored
- Keep vectorized rotate_axis calls intact; no Python loops around phi or mosaic dimensions
- Resist the temptation to regenerate the C trace; rely on the checked-in 202510070839 log unless the supervisor instructs otherwise
- Document skipped steps explicitly in metadata if CUDA or other resources are unavailable, to prevent re-opened attempts later

Summary: Lock the spec φ=0 baselines (rot_b_y, k_frac) with fresh traces, document ≤1e-6 deltas, and keep parity shim work gated
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / L3k.3c.3 lock spec φ=0 baselines
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_k_frac_phi0_matches_c -v
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/trace_py_rot_vector.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/trace_harness_cpu.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/comparison_summary.md, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/delta_metrics.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/pytest_phi0.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/collect_only.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/config_snapshot.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/sha256.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 L3k.3c.3 — env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity -v
If Blocked: env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py | tee "'${TS}/collect_only.log, dump current φ=0 deltas into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md, stash harness stdout, and pause for supervisor review before modifying implementation

Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 mandate φ=0 identity rotation, so rot_b_y and k_frac must be recorded against the 0.7173197865 Å and 1.6756687164 targets
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 isolates the nanoBragg C carryover defect; keeping PyTorch default spec-compliant is non-negotiable until the shim exists
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:288-320 leaves L3k.3c.3 open until CPU (and CUDA) traces show ≤1e-6 deltas plus refreshed pytest evidence
- docs/fix_plan.md:450-520 calls for updated comparison_summary.md, delta_metrics.json, and checklist rows before advancing to parity shim tasks
- tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py:25-273 already assert the spec baselines; passing them confirms the simulator still honors the spec after recent merges
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md:116-353 enumerates VG gates and artifact expectations you must satisfy this loop
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4 enforces CPU+CUDA smoke coverage for tensor math edits; cite it when logging the Attempt metadata
- CLAUDE.md Rule 13 (metric duality) and Rule 11 (C reference docstrings) remain in force; do not regress the cross-product recalculation while gathering evidence
- galph_memory.md latest entry reiterates that the shim work is deferrable; respect the standing decision to finish L3k.3c.3 before new implementation
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/fix_checklist.md VG-1 rows (lines 18-46) still marked pending; your artifacts should let you tick them
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251007154213/comparison_summary.md contains the historic deltas; supersede it with the new timestamped capture
- CLAUDE.md Protected Assets Rule forces us to keep docs/index.md consistent; storing outputs under reports/ preserves compliance during evidence capture
- Project long-term goal #1 (parallel supervisor command) depends on this gate; clearing it unlocks downstream normalization and parity reruns
- Long-term goal #2 (ensuring spec rejects the C bug) requires this loop to confirm that the default behavior remains spec-aligned post-fixes

How-To Map:
- export TS="reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)" && mkdir -p "$TS" && printf "timestamp=%s'"\\n\" \""'$TS" >> ${TS}/metadata.txt
- cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/config_snapshot.json ${TS}/config_snapshot.json to capture the supervisor command parameters used for this run
- echo NB_C_BIN=${NB_C_BIN:-./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg} >> ${TS}/metadata.txt to document the C binary provenance
- Ensure editable import path and MKL guard: export PYTHONPATH=src; export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE; verify `which nanoBragg` points to the editable install before running harnesses
- KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --out ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector.log --device cpu --dtype float32 | tee ${TS}/trace_harness_cpu.log
- Verify trace_harness exit code and file sizes; if trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json is missing, rerun with --emit-per-phi to regenerate the JSON payload expected by compare_per_phi_traces.py
- shasum -a 256 ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector.log ${TS}/trace_harness_cpu.log > ${TS}/sha256.txt for reproducibility
- KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/202510070839/c_trace_phi_202510070839.log > ${TS}/comparison_stdout.txt
- jq '"'.per_phi_entries' "'${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json > ${TS}/per_phi_entries.json to document the raw values before summarising deltas
- python scripts/summarise_phi_deltas.py ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json --out ${TS}/delta_metrics.json --threshold 1e-6 >> ${TS}/comparison_stdout.txt
- env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c -v | tee ${TS}/pytest_rot_b.log
- env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_k_frac_phi0_matches_c -v | tee ${TS}/pytest_k_frac.log
- cat ${TS}/pytest_rot_b.log ${TS}/pytest_k_frac.log > ${TS}/pytest_phi0.log to simplify fix_plan references; record CPU runtime in metadata.txt
- If CUDA is available, rerun the harness with --device cuda --dtype float32, store outputs as ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector_cuda.log and delta_metrics_cuda.json, and capture pytest logs with `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -k TestPhiZeroParity --device cuda -v | tee ${TS}/pytest_phi0_cuda.log`
- Append device availability, torch version, and git SHA via `python -c "import torch, subprocess; print(f'"'device={torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"}')\" >> "'${TS}/metadata.txt`
- Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md with a new section summarising metrics, referencing ${TS}/delta_metrics*.json, pytest logs, and comparison_stdout.txt
- Mark VG-1 entries in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md as complete with timestamp, device, and delta figures; include both CPU and CUDA rows when applicable
- Append Attempt details to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (rot_b delta, k_frac delta, pytest runtimes), artifact paths (TS folder), references to spec lines, and confirmation that Next Actions move to L3k.3c.4
- Run `git status --short reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector` to confirm no stray temp files remain before committing artifacts

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not reintroduce `_phi_last_cache` or any cached φ state in production code while collecting evidence
- Avoid hard-coding CPU tensors when running CUDA validation; use `.to(device)` based on harness arguments
- Never touch docs/index.md assets when creating timestamp folders; keep all outputs under reports/...
- Skip nb-compare or normalization reruns; focus strictly on per-φ baselines this loop
- Do not loosen pytest tolerances; maintain abs=1e-6 assertions in tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
- Keep harness RNG seeds stable; do not modify mosaic seed inputs while capturing traces
- Confirm NB_C_BIN still points to golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg before invoking compare_per_phi_traces.py so the C trace reference remains valid
- Capture SHA256 hashes with `shasum -a 256 ${TS}/trace_py_rot_vector.log` to make future audits replicable
- Log CUDA availability in metadata.txt to clarify skipped GPU runs if hardware is absent
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE is exported before importing torch inside ad-hoc shells or scripts
- Do not delete historical timestamp folders; new evidence should be additive for auditability
- Avoid editing plan status markers prematurely; update plans/active and fix_plan only after the evidence is stored
- Keep vectorized rotate_axis calls intact; no Python loops around phi or mosaic dimensions
- Resist the temptation to regenerate the C trace; rely on the checked-in 202510070839 log unless the supervisor instructs otherwise
- Document skipped steps explicitly in metadata if CUDA or other resources are unavailable, to prevent re-opened attempts later

**Preparing final summary message**
[2025-10-07T23:13:34] codex

**Focus Update**
- Reconfirmed CLI-FLAGS-003 is still gated on Phase L3k.3c.3; historic “VG‑1 complete” notes predate the latest rotation refactor, so we need fresh φ=0 evidence before touching the parity shim.
- Rechecked the governing docs (specs/spec-a-core.md:211, docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166, fix_plan.md:461, plan.md:309); default PyTorch must stay spec-clean (rot_b_y=0.7173197865 Å, k_frac=1.6756687164) while the C carryover bug remains quarantined.

**Supervisor Instructions**
- Overwrote `input.md` (102 lines, Parity mode) directing Ralph to stamp a new `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<ts>/` folder, rerun `trace_harness.py` + `compare_per_phi_traces.py` + `summarise_phi_deltas.py`, execute both `TestPhiZeroParity` selectors, and archive all logs plus SHA256 hashes.
- Called out updates to `diagnosis.md`, `fix_checklist.md`, and `docs/fix_plan.md` so VG‑1 rows can flip to done once ≤1e-6 deltas are documented (CPU and CUDA when available).
- Explicitly deferred Phase L3k.3c.4 shim design and nb-compare reruns until the new evidence is stored.

**Repository State**
- Added a supervisor log entry to `galph_memory.md`; no production code touched.
- Tests: not run.
