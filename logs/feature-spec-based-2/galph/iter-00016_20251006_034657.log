review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, Do Now SHALL be evidence‑only: run the authoritative reference reproduction commands and capture the required artifacts; at most run the project’s test discovery (no execution). Do not include runnable tests.

Validation Preflight (tests): Before listing any test file/identifier in Do Now, validate that it resolves via the project’s documented test discovery; if validation fails, omit tests and note “(none — evidence‑only this loop)” and add a TODO in docs/fix_plan.md documenting the missing mapping.

Human Summary (input.md header): Prepend a short summary block with the following lines (validated where applicable):
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>

Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it relate to? 
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? if not, fix. things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, this should be addressed. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
- Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
- Header: timestamp, current commit hash (short), author “galph”, and Active Focus summary.
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the authoritative pytest command/env. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

Rules:
- Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
- If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-17 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the full CUSTOM pix0 transform, with validation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f*/`. The parity rerun (F3) remains outstanding, and C traces continue to show the MOSFLM orientation missing because `-mat` still collapses to canonical vectors. Polarization (C Kahn ≈0.913 vs PyTorch 1.0) stays deferred until geometry parity lands.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Current harness injects the custom beam vector manually; CLI parity requires native wiring.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

**Organizing deep analysis and next steps**

I’m preparing to do a deep analysis of the codebase based on long-term goals, starting with checking environment variables and plan phases. Next, I’ll flip a coin per instructions, then inspect recent commits and evaluate if a new plan is needed, making sure to track everything in memory and prepare proper documentation. Let’s first verify the active plan, environment setup, and code state.

docs/fix_plan.md:448:## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
docs/fix_plan.md:457:- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
docs/fix_plan.md:470:      - C code treats `-pix0_vector` and `-pix0_vector_mm` identically (strstr match, no unit conversion)
docs/fix_plan.md:482:      - ✅ pix0_vector_mm millimeters alias parsing with conversion to meters (mm * 0.001)
docs/fix_plan.md:513:      - End-to-end CLI test: `-pix0_vector_mm 100 200 300` → `pix0_vector tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])`
docs/fix_plan.md:521:    Metrics: Parser equivalence verified: `-pix0_vector -0.2 0.3 0.4` and `-pix0_vector_mm -200 300 400` both yield `pix0_override_m=(-0.2, 0.3, 0.4)`. Dual-flag error handling confirmed (raises ValueError). Detector cache stability verified across CPU/CUDA with invalidate_cache() preserving override tensor. CLI help smoke tests: 6/6 passed.
docs/fix_plan.md:546:      - `-pix0_vector_mm` flag correctly parsed and converted to meters (mm→m via ×0.001)
docs/fix_plan.md:578:      - C transforms the input: `-pix0_vector_mm -216.336... 215.205... -230.200...` → output pix0 = `-0.216475... 0.216343... -0.230192...` (note Y changed from 215.2 to 216.3 mm)
docs/fix_plan.md:606:    Observations/Hypotheses: CLI successfully parsed all flags including `-beam_vector`, `-pix0_vector_mm`, `-convention CUSTOM` inputs, but `Detector.__init__` ignores `custom_beam_vector` from config and falls back to convention defaults. This is the second geometry gap alongside the pix0 transform issue documented in Attempt #5 (Phase E). Running the evidence harness also created a duplicate copy of the structure-factor file (`scaled.hkl.1`, identical to `scaled.hkl`) in the repo root; treat it as an artefact that needs removal during the upcoming implementation pass so repo hygiene stays intact.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references).

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py` (create minimal harness if missing) to capture CPU timings for 256² and 512² detectors; record outputs in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v` plus a microbenchmark (`python scripts/benchmarks/sample_absorption_baseline.py`) so we have pre-refactor timings; store under `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
- Attempts History: None — new item.
- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A/B/C2/D3/E/F1/F2 ✅; documentation + Phase F3 plus Phases G–H pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: (1) Finish plan Phase C docs updates (C3/C4) so CLI flag support is documented; (2) Execute plan Phase F3 by rerunning the supervisor parity command for C and PyTorch, capture artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`, and log Attempt #12; (3) Advance to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation in Crystal and refresh traces; (4) After geometry parity, tackle polarization alignment and documentation via Phase H, then clean up straggling artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).

    [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F3 parity evidence capture (Attempt #12)
    
    Evidence-only loop per supervisor directive (input.md). Executed:
    1. C reference run with -pix0_vector_mm and -nonoise flags
    2. PyTorch CLI run with same parameters
    3. Pytest collection smoke test (624 items / 1 skipped)
    4. Image comparison and metrics capture
    
    Critical finding: Near-zero correlation (-5e-06) indicates Phase F detector
    fixes did NOT resolve geometry mismatch. Missing MOSFLM A* orientation
    (Phase G) likely dominant blocker.

Author: ollie <ohoidn>

    [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F2: Port CUSTOM pix0 transform - remove early return, derive close_distance
    
    - Removed early return at detector.py:407 that bypassed r_factor/close_distance calculation
    - pix0_override now used as final pix0 value while still calculating derived quantities
    - close_distance derived via dot(pix0_vector, odet_vec) matching C code (nanoBragg.c:1846)
    - r_factor properly calculated from rotated detector normal
    - Implementation preserves differentiability (no .detach/.cpu/.item calls)
    - All tests pass: pix0 CLI 10/10, detector geometry 30/30
    - Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_validation.txt
    
    Tests: pix0 CLI 10/10 passed, detector geometry 30/30 passed

I'm checking the plan files for completed steps and whether plan updates are needed to reflect these findings and guide feedback and next actions.

**Evaluating distance_corrected property and plan updates**

I'm checking whether the `distance_corrected` property updates correctly since we only set `self.close_distance` but might have missed updating `distance_corrected`. This could be a bug affecting Step 2 feedback. I’m also considering how to revise the plan, especially regarding orientation fixes and the new distance issue, while reviewing previous steps and plan phases to decide if adjustments are needed.

### Phase F — Detector Implementation (beam + pix0 parity)
Goal: Port CUSTOM detector wiring so CLI overrides reproduce C behavior without ad-hoc harness patches.
Prereqs: Phase E traces complete; docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log captures pix0/beam/orientation findings.

    Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase F2 to port CUSTOM pix0 transformation logic from C; (2) Re-run the Phase F1 validation snippet so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/beam_vector_after_fix.txt` captures the tensor dump (current file is empty); (3) Run Phase F3 parity smoke test after F2; (4) Continue to Phase G for crystal orientation fix.

      - Beam vector incident direction **DOES match** in the trace because the harness explicitly sets `simulator.incident_beam_direction`; CLI wiring still ignores `custom_beam_vector` (see Attempt #7 evidence).
      - Intensity error (446 vs 4.5e-6) is consequence of wrong crystal orientation → wrong reflection → wrong structure factor (300.58 vs 42.98).
    Next Actions: (1) **URGENT:** Investigate A.mat loading in PyTorch - verify file is read, orientation matrix extracted, and applied to lattice vectors (compare with C TRACE lines 11-51 showing matrix loading); (2) Port CUSTOM pix0 transformation from C code; (3) Fix polarization calculation; (4) Re-run Phase E traces after fixes to verify alignment.
  * [2025-10-16] Attempt #9 (galph) — Result: analysis update. Phase E artifacts reviewed; plan extended with detector (Phase F), orientation (Phase G), and polarization (Phase H) implementation tracks.
    Metrics: `trace_summary.md` confirms PyTorch `rot_a=[25.63,-9.11,6.50]` vs C `rot_a=[-14.36,-21.88,-5.55]`; `trace_side_by_side.tsv` shows pix0 Y delta 1.1375e-3 m; `beam_vector_check.txt` still reports `[0.,0.,1.]` for CLI instantiation (manual override only in harness).
    Artifacts: No new runs; consumed `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md`, `trace_side_by_side.tsv`, `beam_vector_check.txt`.
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - CLI must retain MOSFLM reciprocal vectors from `-mat` and thread them into `Crystal`; current conversion to cell params loses orientation entirely.
      - Detector override path must adopt CUSTOM transform instead of returning early; needs to share pivot/rotation logic with standard path.
      - `custom_beam_vector` wiring absent in Detector/Simulator; harness `simulator.incident_beam_direction = ...` is a stopgap that masks the gap.
      - Polarization mismatch persists (0.9126 vs 1.0) but defer until geometry parity returns.
      - Residual repo hygiene note: duplicate `scaled.hkl.1` still present; remove once implementation loop lands to keep Protected Assets policy satisfied.
    Next Actions: Follow `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase F (thread beam vector, port pix0 transform, rerun parity), then Phase G (retain A*, update Crystal, re-trace). Log Attempt #10 once implementation changes begin; clean up `scaled.hkl.1` during that pass.
  * [2025-10-16] Attempt #10 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase F1 complete). **custom_beam_vector threading implemented and validated.**
    Metrics: Supervisor command snippet confirms correct beam_vector retrieval: `tensor([5.1388e-04, 0.0000e+00, -1.0000e+00])` matches expected `(0.00051387949, 0.0, -0.99999986)`.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:212` - Added `custom_beam_vector` field to DetectorConfig
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:846-871` - Updated `beam_vector` property to use custom override for CUSTOM convention
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:870` - Threaded `custom_beam_vector` from CLI parser to DetectorConfig

    27	| B2 | Thread `-nonoise` to simulator | [D] | `parse_and_validate_args()` records `suppress_noise`, and the noise writer at `__main__.py:1170-1199` skips SMV noise output when true. Add warning copy before closing Phase C. |
    28	| B3 | Support pix0 overrides | [D] | Fixed detector override assignment bug (2025-10-05). `_calculate_pix0_vector()` now assigns to `self.pix0_vector` and sets `r_factor=1.0`, `distance_corrected=distance`. Device/dtype coercion preserved via `.to()`. Verified: CLI `-pix0_vector_mm 100 200 300` → tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]). |
    29	| B4 | Preserve meter and mm flag parity | [D] | Run paired parser smoke checks proving `-pix0_vector` (meters) and `-pix0_vector_mm` (millimetres) yield identical `pix0_override_m` tensors and that dual-flag usage raises `ValueError`.

   440	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   441	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   442	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   443	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   444	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   445	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   446	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

   455	  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   456	  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
   457	- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
   458	- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass. (3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces. (4) Once geometry parity holds, execute Phase H polarization alignment and clean up residual artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F2 transform + parity rerun prep

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v

If Blocked: Capture a fresh parallel trace (C vs PyTorch) for the supervisor command and document deltas in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/pix0_transform_blocked.md

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:76 — F2 stays partial until CUSTOM pix0 transform matches C output and updates distance_corrected.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Fix-plan next actions now require F2 refit before parity rerun; keep ledger aligned.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35 — Spec spells out pivot-based pix0 flow you must mirror when reworking the override.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1733 — C reference shows exact Fclose/Sclose/close_distance logic to port.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Evidence from Attempt #12 proving parity is still off; use as baseline.

How-To Map:
- export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg (C binary for comparisons).
- Reproduce C behavior: "'`nanoBragg -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin ... -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866` (full supervisor command in input attempt history); capture pix0/polar logs.
- After implementing transform, run `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v` (CPU) and repeat with CUDA when available.
- Validate detectors: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py --config reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.yaml` and stash updated pix0 output under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt`.
- Re-run parity smoke once F2 passes: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest --collect-only` (evidence) then full command; log metrics to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not short-circuit `_calculate_pix0_vector`; reuse shared pivot/rotation path.
- Keep tensors device/dtype neutral (no forced `.cpu()` or `.item()` in differentiable flows).
- Preserve vectorization; no new Python loops around pixels/sources.
- Respect Protected Assets (docs/index.md) when touching referenced files.
- Avoid rerouting automation; follow prompts/debug.md when debugging parity.
- Do not delete `scaled.hkl` artifacts until supervisor directs a hygiene sweep.
- Ensure AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC stays exported for every pytest run.
- Skip noise generation updates unless -nonoise regression appears.
- Capture artifacts under `reports/` every loop (plan phases demand evidence).
- No ad-hoc scripts outside `scripts/`; reuse existing harnesses.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F2 transform + parity rerun prep

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v

If Blocked: Capture a fresh parallel trace (C vs PyTorch) for the supervisor command and document deltas in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/pix0_transform_blocked.md

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:76 — F2 stays partial until CUSTOM pix0 transform matches C output and updates distance_corrected.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Fix-plan next actions now require F2 refit before parity rerun; keep ledger aligned.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35 — Spec spells out pivot-based pix0 flow you must mirror when reworking the override.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1733 — C reference shows exact Fclose/Sclose/close_distance logic to port.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Evidence from Attempt #12 proving parity is still off; use as baseline.

How-To Map:
- export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg (C binary for comparisons).
- Reproduce C behavior: "'`nanoBragg -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin ... -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866` (full supervisor command in input attempt history); capture pix0/polar logs.
- After implementing transform, run `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v` (CPU) and repeat with CUDA when available.
- Validate detectors: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py --config reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.yaml` and stash updated pix0 output under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt`.
- Re-run parity smoke once F2 passes: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest --collect-only` (evidence) then full command; log metrics to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not short-circuit `_calculate_pix0_vector`; reuse shared pivot/rotation path.
- Keep tensors device/dtype neutral (no forced `.cpu()` or `.item()` in differentiable flows).
- Preserve vectorization; no new Python loops around pixels/sources.
- Respect Protected Assets (docs/index.md) when touching referenced files.
- Avoid rerouting automation; follow prompts/debug.md when debugging parity.
- Do not delete `scaled.hkl` artifacts until supervisor directs a hygiene sweep.
- Ensure AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC stays exported for every pytest run.
- Skip noise generation updates unless -nonoise regression appears.
- Capture artifacts under `reports/` every loop (plan phases demand evidence).
- No ad-hoc scripts outside `scripts/`; reuse existing harnesses.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F2 CUSTOM pix0 transform + parity rerun prep

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v

If Blocked: Capture a fresh C/PyTorch parallel trace for the supervisor command, store it as reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/pix0_transform_blocked.md, and note the exact divergence before touching code again.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:74-79 — Phase F2 remains [P]; we must mirror nanoBragg.c CUSTOM math (Fclose/Sclose, rotations, distance recompute) before parity can move forward.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-458 — Fix-plan next actions now explicitly demand F2 refit and fresh parity evidence; failing to follow breaks our coordination loop.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35-120 — This section defines pivot-specific pix0 flows and coordinate conventions; implementation must align exactly to satisfy Core Rules 12–15.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1733-1849 — The C reference shows the precise order of operations (ratio, close_distance, rotations, pix0 logging) we are missing; use it as the ground truth.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Attempt #12 shows correlation ≈−5e-06 and 116× intensity ratio; we must improve on that artifact and archive the follow-up run.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:25-92 — Authoritative commands + trace-first debugging reminders; keep AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC exported for every run.

How-To Map:
- Export NB_C_BIN first: "'`export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` to guarantee we hit the instrumented C binary when reproducing traces.
- Reproduce the C baseline using the full supervisor command (stored in docs/fix_plan.md and prompts/supervisor.md); capture stdout/stderr into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/c_baseline.log and copy DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR into the same directory.
- Implement the CUSTOM pix0 transform inside `_calculate_pix0_vector`: compute Fclose/Sclose from dot products, run through rotate/rotate_axis for SAMPLE pivot, and recompute `distance_corrected = close_distance / ratio` after you override close_distance.
- After code edits, run `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v` (CPU) to ensure CLI coverage stays green; attach the log under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pytest_pix0.log.
- If CUDA is available, repeat with `device=cuda` (`pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 --device cuda -v`) to respect device neutrality, or document unavailability in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pytest_pix0_cuda.log.
- Validate geometry numerically: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py --config reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.yaml --pixel 1039 685 --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/trace_after_transform.txt` and confirm pix0 + beam entries match C within ≤1e-12.
- Re-run parity smoke once F2 passes: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest --collect-only` (evidence step) followed by the full supervisor command in both C and PyTorch; stash metrics under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/attempt13_metrics.json.
- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts and plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md (F2/F3 rows) with findings before ending the coding loop.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not re-introduce the early return in `_calculate_pix0_vector`; the override must flow through the shared pivot logic.
- Keep tensors on caller-supplied device/dtype; no `.cpu()`, `.numpy()`, or `.item()` in differentiable paths.
- Maintain vectorization; avoid new Python loops over pixels, phi steps, or thicksteps.
- Respect Protected Assets (docs/index.md) before editing or deleting referenced files.
- Follow prompts/debug.md rules for parity debugging; no ad-hoc shortcuts or trace-only rewrites.
- Do not delete or rename `scaled.hkl`, `scaled.hkl.1`, or other inputs until supervisor explicitly schedules hygiene.
- Ensure AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC stays exported for every pytest or parity invocation.
- Avoid inventing new scripts outside `scripts/`; reuse debug_pixel_trace.py and existing harnesses.
- Capture every significant run under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/` or `/phase_f/` so plan evidence remains auditable.
- Remember -nonoise only suppresses noise image generation; base float/int outputs must still be written.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — F2 audit)
- Reviewed latest sync (commit 4c8bda2). Attempt #12 parity artifacts confirm near-zero correlation; geometry gap persists. Ralph’s Phase F2 change still emits the raw override vector and never recomputes "'`distance_corrected` after dotting pix0 with odet.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to mark F2 as [P] and F3 as [P]; guidance now requires porting the full CUSTOM transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 before rerunning parity.
- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` next actions in docs/fix_plan.md to mandate the F2 refit + parity redo prior to Phase G orientation work; added supervisor note flagging F2’s incomplete state.
- Issued new input.md directing Ralph to implement the transform, rerun pix0 tests, capture traces, and only then loop back to parity. No new plans required; vectorization roadmap unchanged.
- Feedback for Ralph: formality around parity artifacts is good, but we still need the CUSTOM transform and A* orientation before metrics improve.

 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

+- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass.

(2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass.

+## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — F2 audit)
+- Reviewed latest sync (commit 4c8bda2). Attempt #12 parity artifacts confirm near-zero correlation; geometry gap persists. Ralph’s Phase F2 change still emits the raw override vector and never recomputes `distance_corrected` after dotting pix0 with odet.
+- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to mark F2 as [P] and F3 as [P]; guidance now requires porting the full CUSTOM transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 before rerunning parity.
+- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` next actions in docs/fix_plan.md to mandate the F2 refit + parity redo prior to Phase G orientation work; added supervisor note flagging F2’s incomplete state.
+- Issued new input.md directing Ralph to implement the transform, rerun pix0 tests, capture traces, and only then loop back to parity. No new plans required; vectorization roadmap unchanged.
+- Feedback for Ralph: formality around parity artifacts is good, but we still need the CUSTOM transform and A* orientation before metrics improve.

    12	- docs/fix_plan.md:448-458 — Fix-plan next actions now explicitly demand F2 refit and fresh parity evidence; failing to follow breaks our coordination loop.
    13	- docs/architecture/detector.md:35-120 — This section defines pivot-specific pix0 flows and coordinate conventions; implementation must align exactly to satisfy Core Rules 12–15.
    14	- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1733-1849 — The C reference shows the precise order of operations (ratio, close_distance, rotations, pix0 logging) we are missing; use it as the ground truth.
    15	- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Attempt #12 shows correlation ≈−5e-06 and 116× intensity ratio; we must improve on that artifact and archive the follow-up run.
    16	- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:25-92 — Authoritative commands + trace-first debugging reminders; keep AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC exported for every run.
    17	
    18	How-To Map:
    19	- Export NB_C_BIN first: `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` to guarantee we hit the instrumented C binary when reproducing traces.
    20	- Reproduce the C baseline using the full supervisor command (stored in docs/fix_plan.md and prompts/supervisor.md); capture stdout/stderr into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/c_baseline.log and copy DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR into the same directory.

[2025-10-06T03:53:47] bash -lc 'nl -ba galph_memory.md | tail -n 20' succeeded in 834ms:
   982	- Follow-up: Ralph to refactor `_calculate_pix0_vector()` to consume `self.beam_vector`, regenerate artifacts, and log Attempt #11 before tackling Phase F2.
   983	## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — CLI pix0 + vectorization plan)
   984	- Trimmed docs/fix_plan.md (821 lines) by archiving completed GOLDEN-DATA-001 / GRADIENT-MISSET-001 / AT-PARALLEL-012-PEAKMATCH / DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 entries to archive/fix_plan_archive.md with summaries.
   985	- Rebuilt plans/active/vectorization.md into phased roadmap (A–G) covering tricubic evidence → implementation → validation, then detector absorption vectorization & documentation closure.
   986	- Added new fix-plan item `[VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001]` linking to the refreshed plan; status `in_planning` pending Phase A evidence.
   987	- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` focus via input.md: Do Now = Phase F2 CUSTOM pix0 transform (pytest pix0 subset + parity rerun + pix0 vector artifact). Command scaffolding recorded for C & PyTorch runs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/`.
   988	- Outstanding follow-ups for Ralph: implement plan Phase F2, capture pix0/beam artifact, rerun parity harness, then progress to Phase G orientation once geometry aligns.
   989	## 2025-10-17 (galph loop — Phase F3 parity prep)
   990	- Stashed galph_memory to satisfy startup pull, repo synced clean, then restored local edits.
   991	- Read required specs/arch/testing docs plus latest plan/memory; confirmed pix0 override still bypasses CUSTOM transform and -mat orientation remains absent.
   992	- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context to note F1/F2 completion and focus on F3 parity before Phase G; refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` status/next-actions in docs/fix_plan.md.
   993	- Rewrote input.md directing Ralph to capture C & PyTorch parity runs (Phase F3) and log Attempt #12 artifacts; highlighted follow-up orientation and polarization tasks.
   994	- Follow-up: Ralph to run the parity commands, store logs/images under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`, update docs/fix_plan Attempts, then proceed to plan Phase G. Clean up `scaled.hkl.1` once parity + documentation land together.
   995	
   996	## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — F2 audit)
   997	- Reviewed latest sync (commit 4c8bda2). Attempt #12 parity artifacts confirm near-zero correlation; geometry gap persists. Ralph’s Phase F2 change still emits the raw override vector and never recomputes `distance_corrected` after dotting pix0 with odet.
   998	- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to mark F2 as [P] and F3 as [P]; guidance now requires porting the full CUSTOM transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 before rerunning parity.
   999	- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` next actions in docs/fix_plan.md to mandate the F2 refit + parity redo prior to Phase G orientation work; added supervisor note flagging F2’s incomplete state.
  1000	- Issued new input.md directing Ralph to implement the transform, rerun pix0 tests, capture traces, and only then loop back to parity. No new plans required; vectorization roadmap unchanged.
  1001	- Feedback for Ralph: formality around parity artifacts is good, but we still need the CUSTOM transform and A* orientation before metrics improve.

**Summarizing final message structure**

I'll organize the final response into clear bullet sections—Key Updates, Ralph Review, and Next Steps—with relevant file paths and line numbers to highlight the main points and suggestions. This approach will keep everything concise and easy to follow.
[2025-10-06T03:54:06] codex

**Key Updates**
- Reflagged plan Phase F2/F3 as partial and documented the required CUSTOM pix0 math replay in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:74-88`.
- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` next actions to mandate the transform refit plus parity rerun before Phase G work in `docs/fix_plan.md:448-663`.
- Reissued supervisor memo with detailed Do Now / How-To guidance and AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC export requirements in `input.md:1-52`.
- Logged decisions, evidence needs, and feedback for the next loop in `galph_memory.md:996-1001`.
- Tests: not run (planning/review loop only).

**Ralph Review**
- Commit 4c8bda2 captured good evidence, but parity is still near zero; the run confirms geometry remains broken (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json`).
- Current F2 work still returns the raw override tensor at `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:520-527` without applying the CUSTOM transform sequence or reusing the rotated basis.
- `distance_corrected` is frozen before close_distance is recomputed from the override (`src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:471`), so the C ratio/close-distance relationship is not restored.
- Please re-implement the full nanoBragg.c:1733-1846 flow (Fclose/Sclose, rotations, new distance) and attach artifacts per the updated plan before attempting another parity run.

**Next Steps**
1. Port the CUSTOM pix0 transform and `distance_corrected` recompute per plan Phase F2, then capture the validation snippet under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt`.
2. Once F2 passes, rerun the supervisor parity smoke (Phase F3) and update the metrics/attempt log so we can advance to Phase G orientation fixes.
