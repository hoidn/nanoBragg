review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, Do Now SHALL be evidence‑only: run the authoritative reference reproduction commands and capture the required artifacts; at most run the project’s test discovery (no execution). Do not include runnable tests.

Validation Preflight (tests): Before listing any test file/identifier in Do Now, validate that it resolves via the project’s documented test discovery; if validation fails, omit tests and note “(none — evidence‑only this loop)” and add a TODO in docs/fix_plan.md documenting the missing mapping.

Human Summary (input.md header): Prepend a short summary block with the following lines (validated where applicable):
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>

Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it relate to? 
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? if not, fix. things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, this should be addressed. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
- Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
- Header: timestamp, current commit hash (short), author “galph”, and Active Focus summary.
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the authoritative pytest command/env. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

Rules:
- Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
- If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Document version: 1.0 (aligned with specs/spec-a.md)
Target spec: specs/spec-a.md (single-file normative spec)
Implementation target: Python (>=3.11) + PyTorch (float32 default). Type blocks may use TypeScript-style for clarity; implement with Python dataclasses and torch tensors.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references).

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py` (create minimal harness if missing) to capture CPU timings for 256² and 512² detectors; record outputs in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v` plus a microbenchmark (`python scripts/benchmarks/sample_absorption_baseline.py`) so we have pre-refactor timings; store under `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

**Considering CLI plan**
[2025-10-06T04:53:03] exec bash -lc 'cat plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md' in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-06T04:53:04] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md' succeeded in 662ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-17 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the full CUSTOM pix0 transform, with validation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f*/`. The parity rerun (F3) remains outstanding, and C traces continue to show the MOSFLM orientation missing because `-mat` still collapses to canonical vectors. Polarization (C Kahn ≈0.913 vs PyTorch 1.0) stays deferred until geometry parity lands.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Current harness injects the custom beam vector manually; CLI parity requires native wiring.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

# Plan: AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK Completion

**Status:** Active (new 2025-10-15)
**Priority:** High — spec compliance blocker (testing_strategy §4.1)
**Related fix_plan item:** `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` — docs/fix_plan.md
**Created:** 2025-10-15 by galph

## Context
- Initiative: Ensure differentiability guarantees (long-term goal: autodiff-based refinement showcase).
- Phase Goal: Close the remaining Tier-2 gradcheck gaps called out in testing_strategy.md §4.1: `misset_rot_x`, beam `lambda_A`, and `fluence`.
- Current State: Commit 0e3054c implemented gradchecks for unit-cell lengths/angles and detector distance/beam_center_f. Commit d45a0f3 introduced `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE` to work around torch.compile bugs. However, no coverage exists yet for misset rotations or beam parameters, and the harness still emits contradictory compile-mode toggles (`NB_DISABLE_COMPILE` vs `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`). The spec remains unmet.
- Dependencies: `tests/test_gradients.py`, `tests/test_suite.py::TestTier2GradientCorrectness`, `docs/development/testing_strategy.md §4.1`, `arch.md §15`, perf plan task B7 (env-var alignment for compile toggles).

### Phase A — Baseline Audit & Environment Alignment
Goal: Capture authoritative evidence of current coverage gaps and ensure the compile-disable switch is consistent across harnesses before adding new tests.
Prereqs: None.
Exit Criteria: Audit note summarising missing parameters, baseline gradcheck log attached, and env-var naming decision recorded (either standardise on `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE` or support both).

**Outlining detailed analysis and verification steps**

I'm setting up a structured plan to continue reviewing recent commits, especially focusing on certain CLI features like -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm. I want to check implementation progress against long-term goals, evaluate the state of vectorization plans, and ensure git is clean before deciding next steps. This involves examining docs and source files carefully to gather evidence without making code changes.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G2 orientation ingestion before parity rerun
Summary: Preserve MOSFLM A* orientation through Crystal so the supervisor parity command can run end-to-end.
Phase: Implementation
Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G2 — Teach Crystal to ingest MOSFLM orientation
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase G2) — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v

If Blocked: Capture C vs PyTorch lattice-vector traces for the supervisor command (pixel 1039,685) and write summary to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/orientation_blocked.md; log the divergence in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before exiting.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:84 — Phase G2 is the next blocker; without Crystal ingesting MOSFLM A* the parity command cannot succeed.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Fix-plan attempts flag A* loss as the “PRIMARY BUG”; clearing Phase G2 is required before Phase F3 parity rerun.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:182 — Reciprocal vectors must be tensorized and reusable; orientation path must comply with vectorization rules.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:40 — Config map confirms MOSFLM matrices are authoritative for CUSTOM pivot; we must honor them verbatim.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A/B/C2/D3/E/F1/F2 ✅; Phase F3 parity + Phases G–H pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation through the Crystal pipeline; (2) Leave Phase F3 parity blocked until orientation wiring is complete, then rerun the supervisor harness and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`; (3) Address the Phase F2 regression where `self.close_distance` now calls `.item()`—restore a tensor-based value so detector distance remains differentiable before layering additional changes. (4) After geometry parity holds, proceed to Phase H polarization alignment and tidy residual artifacts (e.g., `scaled.hkl.1`).
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-05] Phase A Complete — Tasks A1-A3 executed per plan.
    Metrics: C reference behavior captured for both flags via parallel command execution.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_nonoise.log` - C run WITH -nonoise
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_noise.log` - C run WITHOUT -nonoise

      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` - Complete Phase A findings
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - `-nonoise` suppresses noise parameters section AND noise image generation (noiseimage.img not written)
      - Float/int/PGM images still generated when -nonoise is active

**Reviewing long-term goals and plan statuses**

I'm analyzing the current long-term goals, focusing on whether the CLI plan properly reflects completed phases like G2 and what tasks remain for parity reruns and vectorization. I plan to verify the plan files for task statuses, check if the orientation changes are accounted for, and consider if updates or new plan steps are needed before moving forward.

Goal: Preserve full crystal orientation from `-mat` files so PyTorch matches C lattice vectors and downstream physics.
Prereqs: Detector parity (Phase F) achieved or at least traced; clarity on orientation data flow.
Exit Criteria: Crystal trace (rotated a/b/c vectors) aligns with C for the supervisor command; CLI accepts orientation without manual overrides.

| G1 | Extend CLI config to retain A* vectors | [D] | ✅ Commit 28fc584 stores MOSFLM reciprocal vectors from `-mat` in `parse_and_validate_args` and threads them into `CrystalConfig`; 26-case CLI regression sweep captured in Attempt #15 notes. |
| G2 | Teach `Crystal` to ingest orientation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #17 (ralph). Modified `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors()` (lines 545-603) to detect MOSFLM orientation in config, convert to tensors with proper device/dtype, and integrate with Core Rules 12-13 pipeline. Tests: 26/26 passed (CLI), 35/35 passed (crystal). Metric duality perfect. Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/README.md`. |
| G3 | Trace verification + parity rerun | [ ] | Repeat Phase E harness post-G1/G2; document lattice-vector parity in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation.md` and rerun supervisor parity (artifacts under `phase_g/parity/`). |

### Phase H — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once geometry aligns.
Prereqs: Phases F and G complete; traces confirm geometry parity.
Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | Audit polarization inputs | [ ] | Review CLI defaults/flags (`-polar`, `-nopolar`) and C calculations (nanoBragg.c:2080-2155); map them to PyTorch simulator inputs. |
| H2 | Implement polarization parity | [ ] | Update simulator polarization handling to compute Kahn factor per spec/C reference. Document conversions and add targeted regression tests. |

**Preparing detailed doc updates and next steps**

I’m mapping out careful doc edits to update the fix_plan Next Actions, focusing on Phase G3 parity and trace tasks plus a clear command and artifact plan. I’ll set up precise instructions for running tests and parity checks, refining the patch to reflect completed steps and upcoming work, all while keeping changes strictly to documentation.

Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

(4) After geometry parity holds, proceed to Phase H polarization alignment and tidy residual artifacts (e.g., `scaled.hkl.1`).

**Preparing detailed instructions for orientation updates**

I’m putting together comprehensive instructions to guide updates to the harness for the new orientation handling, aligning it with CLI pipeline behavior using mosflm vectors. I plan to include clear commands for running traces, verifying parity with nb-compare, notes on patching instrumentation, and specifying relevant tests to run afterward, all organized carefully in the input.md file with headers, priorities, pitfalls, and next steps. This should help ensure smooth verification and testing of the orientation changes in Phase G3.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G3 trace verification + parity rerun

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase G3) — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log

If Blocked: Capture PyTorch detector/crystal dumps via "'`python scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py --pixel 1039 685 --config reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_config.yaml > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py_blocked.log` and log the failure mode in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before exiting.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:92 — G3 requires fresh traces + parity artifacts before we can close Phase F3.
- docs/fix_plan.md:454 — Current Next Actions highlight rerunning the Phase E harness and parity checks under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py#L20 — Existing harness needs MOSFLM tensor ingestion updates to reflect new Crystal orientation flow.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:32 — Parallel trace comparison is mandatory; follow SOP when generating TRACE_C/TRACE_PY logs.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:75 — CLI contract for `-mat`, `-pix0_vector_mm`, and `-nonoise`; parity run must prove compliance.

How-To Map:
- `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md`
- `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
- `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/{design,traces,parity,pytest}`
- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py` to pull MOSFLM A* vectors via CrystalConfig (see plan Phase G2 guidance) and write updated notes to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design/harness_delta.md`.
- Rebuild the instrumented C binary using the existing patch `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/c_trace.patch` if the tree has been refreshed.
- Run PyTorch trace: `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log 2> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.stderr`.
- Run C trace with identical command: `$NB_C_BIN -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0 -dump_pixel 1039 685 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log`.

- Run mapped regression tests: `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest/cli_flags_and_geo.log`.
- Summarise findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation.md` and update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts (#18) with metrics + artifact links.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not fall back to canonical reciprocal vectors when MOSFLM data exists; confirm tensors stay on the active device/dtype.
- Avoid `.item()`, `.detach()`, or `.cpu()` inside differentiable paths while adjusting the harness or simulator hooks.
- Ensure CUSTOM pivot logic matches C: recompute close_distance from pix0 and beam vectors after rotation.
- Confirm the C trace instrumentation still prints meters; no Angstrom conversions inside detector geometry.
- Do not delete or rename files listed in docs/index.md (input.md, loop.sh, supervisor.sh, etc.).
- Keep ROI/pixel indices consistent (slow, fast) to avoid 90° rotations in diffs.
- Run commands with documented env vars; no ad-hoc shell scripts or untracked notebooks.
- Preserve vectorization—no Python loops added in the trace harness beyond evidence scaffolding.
- Avoid writing to directories outside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/` without plan approval.

**Expanding instructions with detailed steps**

I’m planning to rewrite the instructions file to increase its length to about 110-130 lines by breaking down each step into finer detail and adding more bullet points. This will make the guidance more thorough and include more context and caution notes while preserving the original structure.

If Blocked: Capture PyTorch detector/crystal dumps via "'`python scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py --pixel 1039 685 --config reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_config.yaml > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py_blocked.log` and log the failure mode in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before exiting.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:80 — Phase G completion hinges on producing new TRACE_C/TRACE_PY logs and rerunning parity with MOSFLM orientation engaged.
- docs/fix_plan.md:454 — Next Actions explicitly call for Phase G3 traces and parity metrics before resuming Phase F3 parity closure.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py#L20 — Existing harness still bootstraps canonical reciprocal vectors and must now ingest `mosflm_a_star/b_star/c_star` tensors.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Baseline correlation (-5e-06) quantifies the current regression; new parity artifacts must show improvement.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:32 — Trace-first debugging SOP is mandatory; adhere to the Phase E instrumentation workflow when regenerating logs.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:70 — CLI contract for `-mat`, `-pix0_vector_mm`, `-beam_vector`, and `-nonoise`; parity run is the acceptance proof for Goal #1.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:118 — CUSTOM convention requires recomputing pix0/close_distance; parity will confirm our port matches the C transform.

How-To Map:
- `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md`
- `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
- `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest`
- Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md` to refresh the prior divergence notes; jot MOSFLM-specific updates in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design/orientation_notes.md`.
- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py` so CrystalConfig receives `mosflm_a_star`, `mosflm_b_star`, `mosflm_c_star`, and ensure the harness mirrors CLI flag precedence (mm→m conversion, CUSTOM convention, BEAM pivot semantics).
- Document code deltas and reasoning in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design/harness_delta.md` (include line numbers touched and unit-handling notes).
- If the instrumented C binary was rebuilt since Phase E, reapply `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/c_trace.patch`, run `make -C golden_suite_generator`, and confirm the binary still honors `-dump_pixel`.
- Generate the PyTorch trace: `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log 2> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.stderr`.
- Trim stderr for warnings; if present, capture them verbatim in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.stderr` and annotate the design notes with mitigation actions.
- Generate the C trace with identical CLI parameters: `$NB_C_BIN -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0 -dump_pixel 1039 685 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log`.
- Preserve the instrumented binary after the run; do not overwrite upstream `./nanoBragg` (protected asset policy).
- Diff the traces: `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_diff.log`.
- Highlight the first difference (if any) in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation.md`, quoting line numbers and variable names.
- Rerun the parity harness: `nb-compare --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity --resample --threshold 0.995 -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0`.
- Save nb-compare metrics (`metrics.json`) and PNG artifacts; include a short interpretation in `parity/README.md` (corr, RMSE, max delta, peak displacement).
- Run regression tests: `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest/test_cli_flags.log`.
- Run geometry guard: `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_geo_003.py::TestATGEO003RFactorAndBeamCenter::test_r_factor_calculation -v | tee -a reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest/test_at_geo_003.log`.
- If CUDA is available, repeat `pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 --maxfail=1` with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` and document availability status in the design notes.
- Summarise trace + parity outcomes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation.md`, including: correlation coefficient, first mismatch (if any), pix0 vector comparison, beam vector confirmation, and remaining gaps (e.g., polarization).
- Update `docs/fix_plan.md` `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Attempts with Attempt #18, referencing all new artifacts and quoting headline metrics.
- Leave a breadcrumb for Phase H (polarization) at the bottom of the summary file, noting the current Kahn factor delta for quick hand-off.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not revert Phase F2 CUSTOM transform; ensure the harness still recomputes `distance_corrected` from the transformed pix0.
- Avoid converting MOSFLM arrays to numpy mid-pipeline; always tensorize with `device=self.device, dtype=self.dtype`.
- No `.item()` usage on tensors that feed gradients (pix0, close_distance, volumes, beam vectors).
- Keep detector and crystal caches invalidated after orientation injections to prevent stale values.
- Respect `(slow, fast)` indexing throughout trace generation; swapping to (fast, slow) will reproduce the 90° parity failure.
- Do not rerun `nb-compare` without `--resample`; shape mismatches must be resolved by resampling to align array sizes.
- Ensure `NB_C_BIN` points to the instrumented binary; running the frozen root binary will omit `-dump_pixel` output.
- Store every artifact under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`; stray files in repo root will break hygiene rules.
- After tests, check for new warnings in stderr/stdout and document them; silence may indicate disabled tracing.
- Keep the worktree clean; abort changes if Protected Assets are touched inadvertently.

(4) After geometry parity holds, proceed to Phase H polarization alignment and tidy residual artifacts (e.g., `scaled.hkl.1`).
+- Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase G3 by rerunning the Phase E trace harness and capturing fresh C↔Py lattice-vector comparisons plus a supervisor parity attempt under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`; (2) Once traces and parity metrics are archived, unblock Phase F3 by updating the parity artifacts and fix_plan attempts, then close out Phase G; (3) With geometry verified, advance to Phase H polarization alignment (tasks H1–H3) and clean up residual artifacts such as `scaled.hkl.1` alongside documentation updates.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G3 trace verification + parity rerun

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase G3) — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log

If Blocked: Capture PyTorch detector/crystal dumps via "'`python scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py --pixel 1039 685 --config reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_config.yaml > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py_blocked.log` and log the failure mode in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before exiting.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:80 — Phase G requires fresh TRACE_C/TRACE_PY logs plus parity rerun before we can declare geometry parity.
- docs/fix_plan.md:454 — Current Next Actions emphasise executing Phase G3 and refreshing parity artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py#L20 — Harness must now consume MOSFLM A* tensors to mirror the CLI pipeline implemented in Phase G2.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Previous parity metrics (corr≈−5e-06) establish the regression we must improve.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:32 — SOP mandates parallel trace comparison before implementing further fixes; adhere strictly to the trace workflow.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:70 — Defines semantics for `-mat`, `-pix0_vector_mm`, and `-beam_vector`; parity proves we honour the spec.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:118 — CUSTOM pivot math drives pix0 reconstruction; verifying it via traces guards against regressions.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:186 — Core Rules 12–13 summarised; G3 must show these remain intact with MOSFLM orientation.

How-To Map:
- `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md`
- `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
- `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity`
- `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest`
- Re-read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_summary.md` to recall the pix0 divergence history.
- Append updated context to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design/orientation_notes.md` (include why MOSFLM tensors fix the earlier fallback).
- Edit `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py`:
-  • Add `mosflm_a_star`, `mosflm_b_star`, `mosflm_c_star` fields when constructing `CrystalConfig`.
-  • Ensure the harness still converts mm→m for pix0 overrides exactly once.
-  • Confirm Device/dtype arguments use float64 for traces, matching Phase E precision.
-  • Thread `DetectorConvention.CUSTOM` and pivot selection exactly as CLI does after Phase F2.
- Record edits and reasoning in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design/harness_delta.md` (line numbers and tensor-handling notes).
- If the instrumented binary changed, reapply `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/c_trace.patch` and run `make -C golden_suite_generator`.
- Capture build output in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/design/c_trace_build.log` for audit.
- Generate PyTorch trace:
-  • `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log`
-  • Redirect stderr to `trace_py.stderr` to retain warnings; note any warnings in design notes.
- Generate C trace:
-  • `$NB_C_BIN -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0 -dump_pixel 1039 685 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log`
- Verify both logs contain 40 trace lines; if counts differ log the discrepancy in the summary file.
- Diff traces:
-  • `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_diff.log`
-  • Capture the index of the first mismatch (if any) and the corresponding variable name.
- Document outcomes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation.md` (sections: Overview, Metrics, Divergence, Next Steps).
- Run parity comparison:
-  • `nb-compare --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity --resample --threshold 0.995 -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0`
-  • Preserve the generated PNGs and metrics.json; add commentary (corr, RMSE, max diff, mean diff) to `parity/README.md`.
- Verify PyTorch CLI produced `img.bin` without noise image when `-nonoise` is present; log observation in summary.
- Run regression tests sequentially:
-  • `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest/test_cli_flags.log`
-  • `env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_geo_003.py::TestATGEO003RFactorAndBeamCenter::test_r_factor_calculation -v | tee -a reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest/test_at_geo_003.log`
-  • If CUDA available: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 --maxfail=1 -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest/test_cli_flags_cuda.log`
- Review pytest outputs for new warnings; document any in design notes.
- Update `docs/fix_plan.md` `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Attempts with Attempt #18 (include metrics, artifact paths, notable observations, next steps for Phase H).
- Append a short polarization TODO (current C vs PyTorch Kahn factor) to `trace_summary_orientation.md` to seed Phase H.
- Ensure all artifacts are referenced in the summary and staged later for supervisor review.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- No fallback to canonical reciprocal vectors when MOSFLM tensors are provided; confirm by logging `crystal.config.mosflm_a_star` after construction.
- Avoid `.item()` on tensors like `close_distance`, `distance_corrected`, or volumes; keep them differentiable.
- Do not mix devices—ensure all tensors stay on CPU float64 for traces; PyTorch + CUDA mismatches will skew comparisons.
- Keep `(slow, fast)` indexing consistent; swapping axes recreates 90° rotations and invalidates metrics.
- Retain CUSTOM pivot logic exactly as in Phase F2; do not reintroduce the pre-transform pix0 override.
- Do not overwrite the frozen root `./nanoBragg` binary; instrumentation belongs under `golden_suite_generator/`.
- Store every artifact under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`; stray files violate hygiene SOP.
- Run `nb-compare` with `--resample`; skipping it causes false mismatches due to shape differences.
- Commit summary updates only after verifying metrics; premature updates cause fix_plan drift.
- Keep worktree clean; note any unavoidable leftovers in docs/fix_plan.md.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation through the Crystal pipeline; (2) Leave Phase F3 parity blocked until orientation wiring is complete, then rerun the supervisor harness and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`; (3) Address the Phase F2 regression where `self.close_distance` now calls `.item()`—restore a tensor-based value so detector distance remains differentiable before layering additional changes. (4) After geometry parity holds, proceed to Phase H polarization alignment and tidy residual artifacts (e.g., `scaled.hkl.1`).
+- Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase G3 by rerunning the Phase E trace harness and capturing fresh C↔Py lattice-vector comparisons plus a supervisor parity attempt under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`; (2) Once traces and parity metrics are archived, unblock Phase F3 by updating the parity artifacts and fix_plan attempts, then close out Phase G; (3) With geometry verified, advance to Phase H polarization alignment (tasks H1–H3) and clean up residual artifacts such as `scaled.hkl.1` alongside documentation updates.

**Checking file end for patch context**
[2025-10-06T04:58:06] exec bash -lc 'tail -n 40 galph_memory.md' in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-06T04:58:07] bash -lc 'tail -n 40 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 718ms:
- Verified `_calculate_pix0_vector()` still instantiates convention-default beam vectors, so CUSTOM overrides never influence r-factor/pix0 math despite CLI wiring.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` (Phase F snapshot now flags F1 as [P] with guidance to reuse `self.beam_vector`) and refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Next Actions accordingly.
- Reissued `input.md` to keep Ralph on Phase F1, bundling a validation harness that writes beam/pix0 tensors under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/`.
- Follow-up: Ralph to refactor `_calculate_pix0_vector()` to consume `self.beam_vector`, regenerate artifacts, and log Attempt #11 before tackling Phase F2.
## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — CLI pix0 + vectorization plan)
- Trimmed docs/fix_plan.md (821 lines) by archiving completed GOLDEN-DATA-001 / GRADIENT-MISSET-001 / AT-PARALLEL-012-PEAKMATCH / DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 entries to archive/fix_plan_archive.md with summaries.
- Rebuilt plans/active/vectorization.md into phased roadmap (A–G) covering tricubic evidence → implementation → validation, then detector absorption vectorization & documentation closure.
- Added new fix-plan item `[VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001]` linking to the refreshed plan; status `in_planning` pending Phase A evidence.
- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` focus via input.md: Do Now = Phase F2 CUSTOM pix0 transform (pytest pix0 subset + parity rerun + pix0 vector artifact). Command scaffolding recorded for C & PyTorch runs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/`.
- Outstanding follow-ups for Ralph: implement plan Phase F2, capture pix0/beam artifact, rerun parity harness, then progress to Phase G orientation once geometry aligns.
## 2025-10-17 (galph loop — Phase F3 parity prep)
- Stashed galph_memory to satisfy startup pull, repo synced clean, then restored local edits.
- Read required specs/arch/testing docs plus latest plan/memory; confirmed pix0 override still bypasses CUSTOM transform and -mat orientation remains absent.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context to note F1/F2 completion and focus on F3 parity before Phase G; refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` status/next-actions in docs/fix_plan.md.
- Rewrote input.md directing Ralph to capture C & PyTorch parity runs (Phase F3) and log Attempt #12 artifacts; highlighted follow-up orientation and polarization tasks.
- Follow-up: Ralph to run the parity commands, store logs/images under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`, update docs/fix_plan Attempts, then proceed to plan Phase G. Clean up `scaled.hkl.1` once parity + documentation land together.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — F2 audit)
- Reviewed latest sync (commit 4c8bda2). Attempt #12 parity artifacts confirm near-zero correlation; geometry gap persists. Ralph’s Phase F2 change still emits the raw override vector and never recomputes `distance_corrected` after dotting pix0 with odet.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to mark F2 as [P] and F3 as [P]; guidance now requires porting the full CUSTOM transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 before rerunning parity.

**Preparing structured final summary**

I'm organizing a clear final response covering the Step1 codebase analysis, long-term goals progress, key issues, and next steps for Ralph, with references to updated docs and files while noting the coin flip result and test status.
[2025-10-06T04:59:04] codex

**Key Points**  
- Long-term goal #1 (parallel CLI parity) is down to Phase G3: MOSFLM A* now flows through the config/Crystal pipeline, but we still need fresh C↔Py traces and a parity rerun to verify geometry before tackling polarization. Next actions are captured in `docs/fix_plan.md:455` and the refreshed supervisor memo.  
- No new plan was required; the existing roadmap in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md#L86` already calls for the trace/parity work and we kept the vectorization plan untouched until parity is green.  
- Long-term goal #2 (vectorization) remains queued—Phase A evidence is still outstanding, so we’ll push Ralph toward `plans/active/vectorization.md` once the parity artifacts are updated.  
- Coin flip came up tails, so no retrospective review of Ralph’s prior iterations this loop.  
- Updated `galph_memory.md` with today’s guidance and issued a new `input.md` steering Ralph through MOSFLM-aware trace harness updates, parity rerun, regression tests, and logging Attempt #18.

**Next Steps for Ralph**  
- Follow `input.md` to update the Phase E trace harness for MOSFLM tensors, regenerate TRACE_C/TRACE_PY logs, rerun the supervisor parity command via `nb-compare`, and record results plus Attempt #18 in `docs/fix_plan.md`.  
- After parity artifacts are refreshed, move on to polarization (Phase H) and then kick off `[VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001]` Phase A baselines.

**Admin**  
- Committed as `2ae6079` (`SUPERVISOR: Phase G3 prep - tests: not run`) and pushed to `feature/spec-based-2`. Tests were not executed this loop per supervisory scope.
