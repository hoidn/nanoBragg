review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor evidence mode (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Supervisor Evidence Gate (internal-only): No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Mode flags: Mode flags are combinable and refine execution; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

Callchain Tracing (Evidence Task)
- When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
- Directive: run `prompts/callchain.md` with a question‑driven invocation and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
- Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
  analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
  initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
  scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
  roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
  namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
  time_budget_minutes: 30
- Expected outputs:
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
- Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh):
  1. Phase L2b regression — ✅ COMPLETE (Attempt #67). Regression test `tests/test_trace_pixel.py::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics` exists and passes (4/4 variants). Rerun the trace harness (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py`) to regenerate `trace_py_scaling.log` with real I_before_scaling values instead of "NOT_EXTRACTED".
  2. Phase L2c comparison — Use `compare_scaling_traces.py` to align TRACE_C vs TRACE_PY outputs, record percentage deltas in `scaling_audit_summary.md`, and log the first divergent scaling factor.
  3. Phase L3 prep — Update plan Phase L3 guidance and identify the regression selector(s) that will guard the scaling fix once the divergent factor is confirmed.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #67 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b instrumentation complete). **TRACE_PY now emits real I_before_scaling, polarization, capture_fraction values from simulator internals.**
    Metrics: Test suite 36/36 passed (test_cli_flags.py 31/31, test_trace_pixel.py 5/5). All 4 parametrized variants of test_scaling_trace_matches_physics passing (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Target pixel trace successfully extracts I_before_normalization from physics pipeline.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:977-978,1015-1016` - Saved I_before_normalization in both oversample and no-oversample paths before normalization/omega multiplication
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:1166-1178` - Threaded I_before_normalization through to _apply_debug_output

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-06): Traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) show the SAMPLE pivot fix leaves residual close-distance deltas (~2.8 µm), which push the fractional Miller index from 2.0012 (C) to 1.9993 (PyTorch). Those 0.002 shifts around integer values amplify sincg results (F_latt_b ≈ +21.6%). Need dtype diagnostics to confirm float32 rounding vs geometry formula drift before coding a fix.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-09): Phase A remains untouched; no artifacts exist under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, so Ralph must prioritise A1–A3 baseline capture before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.

**Analyzing long-term plan and scaling issues**

I’m piecing together the current state by reviewing fix_plan docs and active plans, focusing on the CLI scaling mismatch blocking progress in Phase L. I’m sorting through progress notes, attempt results, and audit reports to identify inconsistencies and form hypotheses about current instrumentation and scaling gaps aligned with long-term goals.

      - `docs/fix_plan.md` - This Attempt #40 log
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Implementation:** `has_custom_basis_vectors` check (fdet/sdet/odet/beam) forces `detector_pivot=DetectorPivot.SAMPLE` before distance-based pivot selection
      - **Clarification:** `pix0_override_m` alone does NOT force SAMPLE (only BASIS vectors do); preserves existing pix0_override test behavior
      - **Test coverage:** 5 scenarios validated (default BEAM without custom vectors, single custom vector forces SAMPLE, all four custom vectors force SAMPLE, pix0_override alone keeps BEAM, Detector instantiation honors forced pivot)
      - **C reference update:** Phase H6a C trace shows SAMPLE pivot produces pix0=(-0.216476, 0.216343, -0.230192); updated JSON expected values from old BEAM values
      - **Pivot override behavior:** Even explicit `detector_pivot=DetectorPivot.BEAM` is overridden to SAMPLE when custom basis vectors present (matching C)

Once pix0 parity confirmed, resume Phase K2 normalization with refreshed traces.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #41 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase H6g complete). **pix0 alignment validated; max delta 2.85 μm << 50 μm threshold.**
    Metrics: pix0 deltas: ΔFast=0.123 μm, ΔSlow=0.114 μm, ΔClose=2.851 μm (max=2.851 μm < 50 μm threshold). Beam center perfect match (ΔFclose=0, ΔSclose=0). close_distance delta=2.837 μm, r_factor delta=6.8e-8. All geometry metrics align to sub-micron precision.
    Artifacts:

**Evaluating need for plan updates**

I'm checking whether the existing CLI and vectorization plans require updates based on current progress and long-term goals, reviewing task statuses and cross-references like `docs/fix_plan.md` to decide if creating or modifying plans is necessary.

      - **Pattern analysis:** Deltas show systematic bias (S: +139μm, F: -1136μm, O: -5.6μm), not random error
      - **Possible causes:**
        1. Different beam-center → pix0 conversion logic (Xbeam/Ybeam → Fbeam/Sbeam path)
        2. Pivot mode calculation differs despite identical detector_pivot=BEAM setting
        3. MOSFLM +0.5 pixel offset applied differently in custom vector path
        4. Custom vector projection math differs from C implementation
      - **Missing C instrumentation:** F_latt components, fractional h/k/l not logged in C trace; cannot validate lattice factors until Phase K1 adds instrumentation
    Next Actions:
      1. **BLOCK Phase K normalization work** until pix0 parity resolved; 1.1mm delta will cascade into incorrect Miller index calculations
      2. Add detailed pix0 calculation trace to BOTH C and PyTorch (log Xbeam, Ybeam, Fbeam, Sbeam, basis dot products, pivot terms)
      3. Compare step-by-step pix0 derivation to identify where C and PyTorch diverge
      4. Once pix0 matches (<5e-5 m), resume Phase K1 F_latt work with C instrumentation

**Evaluating plan relevance and choosing focus issue**

I'm reviewing whether the current plans remain valid given that instrumentation is incomplete, particularly focusing on CLI scaling instrumentation in Phase L2b. The existing plan seems consistent but slightly outdated on I_before scaling extraction. I'll prioritize review and housekeeping, especially related to debugging hypotheses on scaling mismatches. My next step is to analyze relevant docs and produce 1-3 debugging hypotheses supported by logs, then begin inspecting the simulator code to verify instrumentation gaps.

**Evaluating instrumentation and harness gaps**

I'm piecing together that the harness currently uses placeholder values instead of real instrumentation outputs, which hinders accurate comparison. The main gap seems to be the harness not hooking into actual simulator output like STDOUT, though traces like `trace_py_stdout.txt` might be clues. Before making any edits, especially to `input.md` or `galph_memory.md`, I need to clearly outline analysis on scaling issues, instrumentation hooking, and CLI flags to align with long-term goals. Checking the current git branch will help prep for those planned input updates.

If Blocked: Snapshot the failing harness attempt via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/blocked_trace_py_scaling.log --device cpu --dtype float32` and log blockers in scaling_audit_summary.md before touching simulator code.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-467 identifies Phase L2b trace instrumentation as the gating task before normalization analysis.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2b notes TRACE_PY still prints `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED` and must emit real tensors.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log currently shows placeholders (`polar 0`, `I_pixel_final 0`).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md documents the expectation to reuse live simulator output rather than harness constants.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log lines 180-212 remain the C reference that the new PyTorch trace must mirror.
How-To Map:
- Modify trace_harness.py to spawn the CLI (`nanoBragg` or `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch`) with `-trace_pixel 685 1039` and redirect stdout to trace_py_stdout.txt before post-processing.
- After capturing stdout, parse the TRACE_PY lines to rebuild trace_py_scaling.log verbatim (preserve ordering and precision).
- Refresh harness_run.log with command + env; update scaling_audit_summary.md with key deltas (polarization, capture_fraction, steps, I_before_scaling, I_pixel_final).
- Validate selectors with `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics` before execution if new parametrisation is added.
- Once harness emits live numbers, diff against C via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md`.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not regenerate trace lines from config constants; rely on simulator stdout so updates track future physics fixes.
- Keep harness evidence-only (no simulator code edits) unless a subsequent plan phase authorises changes.
- Respect Protected Assets: leave docs/index.md references untouched and avoid deleting listed files.
- Preserve device/dtype neutrality when invoking harness—surface `--device`/`--dtype` options instead of hardcoding CPU/float64.
- Do not expand scope into Phase L3 normalization fixes until live trace data is captured and logged.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is exported for every PyTorch invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- Avoid `.item()` on tensors in any future simulator changes; trace collection should stay non-destructive.

Summary: Replace placeholder TRACE_PY scaling log generation with the live simulator output so Phase L2b evidence can proceed.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b instrumentation)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics (collect-only OK in evidence mode)
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_with_absorption (collect-only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_run.log
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_stdout.txt (should capture live TRACE_PY once fixed)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py to capture the simulator’s TRACE_PY stdout/stderr for pixel (685,1039), then run "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`
If Blocked: Snapshot the failing harness attempt via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/blocked_trace_py_scaling.log --device cpu --dtype float32` and log blockers in scaling_audit_summary.md before touching simulator code.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-467 identifies Phase L2b trace instrumentation as the gating task before normalization analysis.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2b notes TRACE_PY still prints `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED` and must emit real tensors.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log currently shows placeholders (`polar 0`, `I_pixel_final 0`).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md documents the expectation to reuse live simulator output rather than harness constants.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log lines 180-212 remain the C reference that the new PyTorch trace must mirror.
How-To Map:
- Modify trace_harness.py to spawn the CLI (`nanoBragg` or `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch`) with `-trace_pixel 685 1039` and redirect stdout to trace_py_stdout.txt before post-processing.
- After capturing stdout, parse the TRACE_PY lines to rebuild trace_py_scaling.log verbatim (preserve ordering and precision).
- Refresh harness_run.log with command + env; update scaling_audit_summary.md with key deltas (polarization, capture_fraction, steps, I_before_scaling, I_pixel_final).
- Validate selectors with `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics` before execution if new parametrisation is added.
- Once harness emits live numbers, diff against C via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md`.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not regenerate trace lines from config constants; rely on simulator stdout so updates track future physics fixes.
- Keep harness evidence-only (no simulator code edits) unless a subsequent plan phase authorises changes.
- Respect Protected Assets: leave docs/index.md references untouched and avoid deleting listed files.
- Preserve device/dtype neutrality when invoking harness—surface `--device`/`--dtype` options instead of hardcoding CPU/float64.
- Do not expand scope into Phase L3 normalization fixes until live trace data is captured and logged.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is exported for every PyTorch invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- Avoid `.item()` on tensors in any future simulator changes; trace collection should stay non-destructive.
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md (Phase L2b table)
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-520 (CLI-FLAGS-003 attempts + next actions)
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (parity evidence expectations)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot and scaling parameter mapping)
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/instrumentation_notes.md (harness assumptions)
Next Up: Phase L2c trace comparison once live PyTorch values are recorded.

**Preparing detailed memory update**

I’m gathering key analysis points about the Phase L2b harness issue to append a clear, well-structured entry in galph_memory.md. My goal is to summarize hypotheses explaining output mismatches, note the placeholder problem, and outline next verification steps—all while keeping consistent formatting for the log.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase L2b harness focus)
- Sync clean (git pull --rebase no-op). Reviewed docs/index.md, specs/spec-a.md shards pointer, arch.md, config map, debugging SOP, testing strategy, docs/fix_plan.md, and plans/active/* per SOP.
- Long-term Goal #1 status: CLI-FLAGS-003 remains blocked at Phase L2b because "'`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` still fabricates TRACE_PY lines (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`, `I_pixel_final 0`). Simulator instrumentation already emits real values (see `tests/test_trace_pixel.py`), so harness must capture stdout instead of synthesizing constants.
- Hypothesis summary: (1) Harness bypass writes placeholders → confirmed by lines 263-283 in trace_harness.py; (2) Missing stdout capture leaves trace_py_stdout.txt empty, so scaling_audit_summary.md lacks real numbers. Next step is to pipe the actual TRACE_PY output into trace_py_scaling.log before comparing to C.
- Long-term Goal #2 check: `plans/active/vectorization.md` is still valid; Phase A evidence artifacts remain absent, so no plan rewrite yet. Ensure Ralph captures tricubic/absorption baselines before implementation when that goal activates.
- No new plan drafted; existing CLI plan already captures Phase L2b work. Updated input.md directing Ralph to fix the harness (collect live TRACE_PY output) and rerun targeted regression test.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute revised input.md — update trace_harness.py to record real simulator output, refresh `trace_py_scaling.log`, update scaling_audit_summary.md with live values, then proceed to Phase L2c comparison once numbers land.

**Preparing final summary and references**
[2025-10-07T04:39:56] codex

**Findings**
- Phase L2b of CLI-FLAGS-003 is still blocked: the harness writes fixed strings instead of the simulator trace, so `trace_py_scaling.log` shows placeholders (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`, `I_pixel_final 0`) rather than live data (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:260` and `trace_py_scaling.log:1`). This keeps the scaling comparison from progressing despite the simulator already producing real values.
- The simulator’s TRACE_PY instrumentation is healthy—`tests/test_trace_pixel.py:1-140` captures genuine polarization, steps, and capture-fraction values—so the gap is confined to the harness/collection path.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-467 and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` both single out Phase L2b instrumentation as the immediate prerequisite before normalization diffs; no additional planning work was needed today, but the plan remains the guiding artifact.
- The vectorization roadmap in `plans/active/vectorization.md` is still valid; Phase A evidence (baseline timings & logs) has yet to be captured, so long-term Goal #2 will remain in “planning ready” state until Ralph records those baselines.

**Hypotheses (ranked)**
- Harness bypass emits placeholders (Confidence: high). `trace_harness.py` hardcodes capture_fraction/polar/omega and sets `I_before_scaling = "NOT_EXTRACTED"` before writing the log (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:260-286`), explaining the zeroed outputs in `trace_py_scaling.log:1-11`. *Next step:* Modify the harness to stream and parse the simulator’s TRACE_PY stdout into the log.
- STDOUT capture is missing (Confidence: medium). The harness leaves `trace_py_stdout.txt` empty, so even after instrumentation fixes the log would stay stale. *Next step:* Redirect the CLI run (or module invocation) into that file, then regenerate `trace_py_scaling.log`.
- Normalization mismatch stems from absent live data (Confidence: low). Until the harness uses real outputs, the 1.2e5 sum_ratio reported earlier can’t be trusted. *Next step:* After fixing capture, rerun the comparison script from Phase L2c to reassess deltas.

**Actions**
- No new multi-turn plan; existing CLI plan covers current needs.
- Updated `input.md` with a harness-focused Do Now (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py`) and refreshed artifact expectations.
- Logged today’s context in `galph_memory.md` so the next loop picks up with Phase L2b harness work.
- Git committed/pushed the supervisory updates (`SUPERVISOR: Phase L2b harness directive - tests: not run`).

**Next Steps**
1. Update `trace_harness.py` to pipe actual TRACE_PY stdout into `trace_py_scaling.log`, then rerun the harness command from input.md and capture new metrics.
2. With live PyTorch values in place, run the targeted pytest selector (`tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`) and proceed to Phase L2c comparison against `trace_c_scaling.log`.
