review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

[2025-10-07T08:16:13] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/vectorization.md' succeeded in 727ms:
## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-18): Phase A1–A3 evidence captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (pytest logs plus tricubic/absorption baselines). No Phase B design memo exists yet—`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md` is still missing—so Ralph must focus on B1–B3 shape/broadcast/gradient notes before touching implementation work. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now lists Phase B as the gating next action block.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-18): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now gates on the Phase B design memo (tasks B1–B3). Complete those notes before touching implementation; assume a clean editable install with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-06 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`, `.collect.log`, `test_at_abs_001.log`, `env.json`). Re-run only if dependencies change or new warnings appear. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-17 parity refresh):
  1. Phase L3c harness audit — Mirror the probe attachment pattern inside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` (assign both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata`) and capture a fresh `harness_hkl_state_*.txt`; while doing so, summarize the new probe findings in `analysis.md` so the evidence bundle is self-contained.
  2. Phase L3c CLI verification — Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL-loading path to ensure it applies the same tensor/metadata attachment and device handling as the harness; today’s re-audit (fc600db) confirms dtype conversion happens but the tensor never moves to `-device cuda`, so document that gap in `cli_hkl_audit.md` and queue a follow-up fix before touching simulator internals.
  3. Phase L3d regression — Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) plus a supervisor-scaling expectation check (CPU/CUDA parametrised once the harness proves out).
  4. Phase L3e scaling validation — Enhance or author a `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` helper to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` to document closure before parity.
  5. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-13] Attempt #71 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b validation + Phase L2c complete). **Harness already functional from Attempt #69; executed comparison script to identify first divergence.**
    Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Comparison identifies `I_before_scaling` as first divergent factor (C=943654.809, PyTorch=0, -100% delta).

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3c device audit - Attempt #79
    
    Evidence-only loop completing supervisor 'Do Now' probe task.
    Confirmed device handling gap: HKL tensor remains on CPU despite -device cuda flag.
    
    Key findings:
    - CLI loads HKL data correctly (49×57×62 grid, float32, metadata present)
    - Device transfer missing: .to(dtype=dtype) without .to(device=device)
    - Will cause device mismatch when CUDA parity validation runs reach structure factor lookup
    
    Artifacts:
    - reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_device_probe.json
    - reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_env.json
    - Updated cli_hkl_audit.md with device probe findings
    
    Tests: pytest --collect-only tests/test_cli_scaling.py (2 collected, no changes)

**Assessing plan update needs**

I'm carefully comparing the existing plans against recent progress and design notes, spotting that Phase B vectorization tasks are done but still unchecked in the plan. Since the instructions call for reviewing and firming up plans, I’m deciding an update to accurately reflect completed tasks and prepare for Phase C is necessary, including touching both the main plan and related fix_plan docs. Next, I'll gather and note key relevant documents before drafting the plan revisions.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-18): Phase A1–A3 evidence captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (pytest logs plus tricubic/absorption baselines). No Phase B design memo exists yet—`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md` is still missing—so Ralph must focus on B1–B3 shape/broadcast/gradient notes before touching implementation work. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now lists Phase B as the gating next action block.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-18): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now gates on the Phase B design memo (tasks B1–B3). Complete those notes before touching implementation; assume a clean editable install with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

## [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001] Vectorize tricubic interpolation and detector absorption
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure factor sampling), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, nanoBragg.c lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) and 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop).
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phase A complete; Phase B design memo outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-18 refresh):
 1. Author the Phase B design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) covering tasks B1–B3—shape/broadcast diagrams, polin3 tensor equations, and gradient/device checklist.
 2. Update `plans/active/vectorization.md`/docs/fix_plan attempts once the memo lands (mark B1–B3 in-progress/complete with references) so implementation tasks can proceed in Phase C.
 3. Outline the targeted regression/benchmark plan within the memo (tests for tricubic + absorption, CPU/CUDA baselines) to unblock Phase C/E validation steps.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.

[2025-10-07T08:17:35] bash -lc 'rg -n "Attempt #3" docs/fix_plan.md' succeeded in 677ms:
52:  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #3 — Result: reopened (supervisor audit). Plan H4 still lacked an explicit Protected Assets checklist and no verification log was archived, so compliance cannot yet be proven.
86:  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #3 — Result: supervisor audit. Confirmed canonical `nanoBragg.c` still diverges from 92ac528^, `reports/2025-09-30-AT-021-traces/` remains under repo root, and a stray top-level `fix_plan.md` (duplicate of docs version) persists. These artefacts keep Plan H1–H4 open and continue to block clean rebases.
259:  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #30 (loop BK) — Result: Phase B tasks B1-B2 COMPLETE. Added profiling instrumentation to `benchmark_detailed.py` and captured 4096² CPU warm trace.
264:  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #31 (loop BL) — Result: Reconciliation study COMPLETE. Resolved 1.25× vs 3.55× measurement discrepancy by executing both 1-iter and 5-iter benchmarks at 4096².
269:  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #32 — Result: supervisor audit (no code change). Detected newly added benchmark set reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/ showing warm speedup_warm=0.299 (PyTorch 1.774s vs C 0.531s) — a return to the original 3.3× slowdown. This contradicts Attempt #31's 1.11× measurements and indicates the improvement is not yet reproducible.
274:  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #33 (loop CA) — Result: Phase B task B6 COMPLETE. Reproducibility study confirms stable performance at 1.21× slowdown.
277:    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) Performance is highly stable (CV<5%) confirming measurements are reliable. (2) Mean slowdown 1.21× exceeds ≤1.2× target by small margin (0.01×). (3) No runs achieved speedup ≥1.0 (range: 0.78–0.88). (4) **Phase B complete—target NOT met, proceed to Phase C diagnostics.** This addresses supervisor's Attempt #32 concern—B6 provides the requested reproducibility data showing stable 1.21× slowdown, not the 3.3× regression detected in 025148. Core geometry tests 31/31 passed.
279:  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #34 (galph loop CG) — Result: Phase B re-opened. New benchmark log `reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/benchmark_results.json` shows warm speedup≈0.30 (PyTorch 1.7738 s vs C 0.5306 s) even with cache hits, contradicting Attempt #33’s 0.828±0.033 average. Investigation found `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` mutates `NB_DISABLE_COMPILE` when `--disable-compile` is toggled while the simulator actually reads `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`, so the flag is ignored and cached compiled simulators bleed across "eager" runs. Because the env var is also unset unconditionally, downstream callers inherit indeterminate compile state and benchmark logs lack mode metadata.
311:  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #3 — Result: success. Combined clone + `torch.compiler.cudagraph_mark_step_begin()` cleared aliasing and preserved gradients.
355:  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #3 — Result: regression worsening. Observed `loop.sh` running `prompts/main.md` in a `{1..40}` loop with unconditional `git push`. No audit artifact captured yet; Phase A still pending.
673:  * [2025-10-24] Attempt #33 (ralph) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase H5e unit correction complete). **Beam-center mm→m conversion implemented; pix0 parity restored.**
685:  * [2025-10-24] Attempt #35 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H5c trace capture). **Critical finding: Attempt #33's beam-center mm→m fix had NO impact on pix0 calculation. Pix0 deltas IDENTICAL to 2025-10-22 baseline.**
686:    Metrics: Pix0 parity NOT achieved. ΔF = -1136.4 μm (exceeds <50 μm threshold), ΔS = +139.3 μm (exceeds threshold), ΔO = -5.6 μm (within threshold). Total magnitude Δ = 1.145 mm. All deltas identical to pre-Attempt #33 baseline.
688:      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout` - Fresh PyTorch trace post-Attempt #33 (wall-clock: ~3s)
695:      - **Attempt #33 ineffective for custom-vector path:** Beam-center fix applied to BEAM pivot calculation in `_configure_geometry()`, but pix0 in custom-vector scenarios is computed via `_calculate_pix0_vector()` which uses a **different code path** not touched by H5e.
701:  * [2025-10-24] Attempt #36 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6a C trace capture). **C pix0 calculation fully instrumented and captured for SAMPLE pivot with custom vectors.**
720:  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #37 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6b PyTorch trace harness instrumented). **PyTorch pix0 trace captured with TRACE_PY lines matching C format.**
737:  * [2025-10-26] Attempt #38 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6c trace diff analysis). **First divergence identified: beam_center_m unit mismatch (mm vs m in trace logging).**
749:  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #39 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6e pivot parity proof). **Confirmed C uses SAMPLE pivot while PyTorch defaults to BEAM pivot for supervisor command.**

**Preparing test documentation and commands**

I'm gathering details to create an input.md that outlines the new and existing mapped tests, specifying artifact paths, environment variables, and how-to commands for running tests and benchmarks. I’m also planning to add helpful pitfalls and pointers to relevant documentation with approximate line numbers using a search tool.

     2	
     3	Use this quick checklist before and after every PyTorch simulator edit. It distills the authoritative guidance from
     4	`docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the testing strategy.
     5	
     6	1. **Vectorization**
     7	   - Do not reintroduce Python loops that duplicate work already handled by batched tensor code.
     8	   - When adding a new flow (sources, phi, mosaic, oversample), extend the existing broadcast shapes instead of looping.
     9	   - Verify `_compute_physics_for_position` receives tensors with the expected batch dimensions.
    10	
    11	2. **Device & Dtype Neutrality**
    12	   - **Default dtype is float32** for performance and memory efficiency. Precision-critical operations (gradient checks, metric duality) explicitly override to float64 where required.
    13	   - Materialize configuration tensors (beam, detector, crystal) on the execution device before the main loop.
    14	   - Avoid per-iteration `.to()`, `.cpu()`, `.cuda()`, or tensor factories (`torch.tensor(...)`) inside compiled regions; cache constants once.
    15	   - Run CPU **and** CUDA smoke commands (`pytest -v -m gpu_smoke`) when a GPU is available.
    16	
    17	3. **torch.compile Hygiene**
    18	   - Watch the console for Dynamo “graph break” warnings; treat them as blockers.
    19	   - Benchmarks should reuse compiled functions; avoid changing shapes every call unless batching logic handles it.

    17	## Executive Summary
    18	
    19	This memo defines the tensor shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient/device requirements for vectorizing the tricubic interpolation pipeline in nanoBragg PyTorch. The current scalar-only implementation (≈5.5 ms/call on CUDA, ≈1.4 ms/call on CPU per Phase A baselines) limits performance when processing batched detector pixels. Vectorization will eliminate Python loops over neighborhood gathering and polynomial evaluation, enabling GPU parallelism and torch.compile optimization.

**Composing structured input.md content**

I'm putting together a well-organized input.md file covering summary, mode, focus, branch, mapped tests, artifacts, do-now line, priorities, how-to map, pitfalls to avoid, pointers, and next steps; I’ll include clear bullet points and follow required length and format guidelines to make everything precise and actionable.

Summary: Vectorize tricubic neighborhood gather per Phase C1 so batched queries stop falling back to nearest-neighbor.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Vectorize tricubic interpolation and detector absorption
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests:
- env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicGather::test_vectorized_matches_scalar -v
- env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py::TestTricubicInterpolation::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled -v
Artifacts:
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/tricubic_gather_diff.json
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase C1 — implement batched "'`(B,4,4,4)` tricubic gather in `Crystal._tricubic_interpolation` using the Phase B design memo, then run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicGather::test_vectorized_matches_scalar -v` (author the test before running it).
If Blocked: Capture the scalar vs batched output comparison for a 4×4 ROI under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/debug/` and note the failure in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/vectorization.md:30 — Phase C requires implementing batched gather before polynomial work can begin.
- docs/fix_plan.md:1683 — Next actions demand C1–C3 execution using the new design memo.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md:21 — Two-stage vectorization plan outlines gather expectations and memory envelope.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:6 — Guardrails for vectorization and device/dtype neutrality must stay satisfied.
How-To Map:
- Implement gather in `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` using advanced indexing per design_notes §2; keep existing nearest-neighbor fallback for empty mask paths.
- Create `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicGather::test_vectorized_matches_scalar` comparing batched vs scalar outputs on a seeded HKL grid; run with `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest ... -v`.
- Re-run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py::TestTricubicInterpolation::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled -v` to ensure legacy behavior holds.
- Document implementation choices, shapes, and warnings under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md`; record any numerical deltas in `tricubic_gather_diff.json`.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave `.item()` or `.cpu()` calls inside the batched gather path.
- Keep HKL tensors on the caller’s device; no implicit `.to('"'cpu')"'` shortcuts.
- Preserve single-warning behavior when fallbacks trigger.
- Avoid adding ad-hoc scripts outside `scripts/`—reuse existing benchmarks if needed.
- Maintain differentiability; no detached tensors in the gather pipeline.
- Respect Protected Assets; do not move files listed in docs/index.md.
- Run only the mapped selective pytest commands during the loop.
- Ensure torch.compile graph breaks are not introduced; watch console output.
- Keep new tensors contiguous and reuse cached ones where possible.

- docs/fix_plan.md:1683 — Current status and next actions for VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md:21 — Gather design and memory guidance.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:6 — Vectorization/device checklist referenced by the plan.

**Appending summary to galph_memory**

I'll write a detailed entry dated 2025-11-18 summarizing today's main activities like the updated vectorization plan, instructions to Ralph for Phase C1, review observations of Ralph's commits, and evaluation notes from Step2 showing steady documentation progress and resolved tasks. Then I'll append it to galph_memory using a shell append command.

## 2025-11-18 (galph loop — VECTOR-TRICUBIC Phase C kick-off)
- Synced clean; reviewed latest plan/docs plus Ralph’s recent commits ("'`d30a581`, `30ab2d1`). Design memo now exists and captures B1–B3; CLI device audit revealed HKL tensors stuck on CPU but no regressions observed.
- Updated `plans/active/vectorization.md` context + Phase B table to mark B1–B3 complete, steering focus to Phase C implementation (C1–C3). Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` next-actions accordingly.
- Authored new `input.md` (Perf mode) directing Ralph to implement Phase C1 batched tricubic gather with a fresh targeted pytest and to log implementation notes under phase_c/.
- Expect Ralph next loop to land the gather vectorization, add the new test, and document deltas before moving to Phase C2 fallback validation. CLI-FLAGS-003 remains pending after gather work.

**Preparing final summary message**
[2025-10-07T08:19:28] codex

**Plan Refresh**
- Marked Phase B complete and redirected `plans/active/vectorization.md:1-33` toward Phase C execution, highlighting the design memo as the contract for the upcoming gather work.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md:1683-1697` so VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now lists C1–C3 as the active next actions.
- Captured steering memo updates in `input.md` (Perf mode) instructing Ralph to implement the batched `(B,4,4,4)` gather with a new targeted pytest and to log results under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`.

**Docs Consulted**
- `plans/active/vectorization.md:1-33` for current phase structure.
- `docs/fix_plan.md:1683-1745` to align ledger next actions.
- `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md:1-39` for Phase B decisions feeding C1.
- `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1-25` to restate vectorization/device guardrails.

**Ralph Audit**
- Latest commits (`d30a581`, `30ab2d1`) delivered the Phase B design memo and CLI HKL device audit; no regressions spotted, but plan metadata was stale—now fixed.

Tests: not run (planning-only loop).

Next steps for Ralph: land Phase C1 (batched gather) with the new targeted pytest, then proceed to C2 fallback validation when the gather path is stable.
