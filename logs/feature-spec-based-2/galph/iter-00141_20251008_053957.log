this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

This shard contains the normative physics, geometry, sampling, and data handling requirements. CLI flag semantics live in [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md); cross-implementation profiles and developer tooling are captured in [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md).

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

# nanoBragg PyTorch — Implementation Architecture

Document version: 1.0 (aligned with specs/spec-a.md)
Target spec: specs/spec-a.md (single-file normative spec)
Implementation target: Python (>=3.11) + PyTorch (float32 default). Type blocks may use TypeScript-style for clarity; implement with Python dataclasses and torch tensors.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Test collection: 35 tests collected successfully in 2.16s (test_cli_scaling_phi0.py + test_phi_carryover_mode.py). Documentation-only loop per input.md Mode: Docs.

**Reviewing long-term goals and fix plans**

I'm starting a thorough review of the codebase focused on key long-term goals like fixing test CLI flags, verifying the phi carryover bug, and progressing the vectorization plan. I’ll examine fix_plan.md and active plans, especially vectorization.md, while also checking docs/bugs for bug verifications to clarify next steps in each area.

[2025-10-08T05:41:02] bash -lc "sed -n '1,200p' plans/active/vectorization.md" succeeded in 687ms:
## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-12-02): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Phase E1 regression sweep finished (artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`); Phase E2–E3 remain open ahead of detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

## Context
- Initiative: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 — establish a repeatable static-analysis loop for `pyrefly` so we can triage violations and delegate fixes without blocking runtime work.
- Phase Goal: Produce a clear, timestamped baseline of pyrefly diagnostics, map them to fix-plan priorities, and hand Ralph a scoped backlog with authoritative commands and artifact locations.
- Dependencies: 
  - `prompts/pyrefly.md` — SOP for running the static-analysis loop.
  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §1.5 — testing cadence and command sourcing rules.
  - `docs/fix_plan.md` — active item ledger for logging attempts and delegations.
  - `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pyrefly]` — configuration guardrail (must remain untouched).
  - Environment availability of the `pyrefly` CLI (verify via `command -v pyrefly`).
- Artifact Policy: Store every run under `reports/pyrefly/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` with `commands.txt`, raw logs, `summary.md`, and `env.json`. Never commit these directories; reference them from fix_plan attempts.

### Phase A — Preconditions & Tool Audit
Goal: Confirm pyrefly is configured and document the command surface before any analysis run.
Prereqs: Clean git status (aside from known WIP), docs/index.md reread, fix_plan entry marked active.
Exit Criteria: Verified tool availability recorded, command plan captured, and reports directory prepared.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Verify configuration | [ ] | Run `rg -n "^\[tool\.pyrefly\]" pyproject.toml` and `pyrefly --version`. Record outputs in `reports/pyrefly/<ts>/commands.txt`. If missing, stop and add TODO to docs/fix_plan.md per prompts/pyrefly.md. |
| A2 | Prep artifact directory | [ ] | Create `reports/pyrefly/<ts>/` with skeleton files (`commands.txt`, `README.md` stub) so later runs stay consistent. |

commit ef1f71639bb4e3407a0feda5e298fa4e744c6ae0
Author: ollie <ohoidn>

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1: Align trace I_before_scaling with C pre-polarization value
    
    Module: simulator/instrumentation
    
    Changes:
    - simulator.py: Clone intensity_pre_polar before polarization (line 326)
    - simulator.py: Return tuple (intensity, intensity_pre_polar) from compute_physics_for_position
    - simulator.py: Unpack tuple at 4 call sites (oversample + pixel-center paths)
    - simulator.py: Pass pre-polar to _apply_debug_output and emit both labels
    - compare_scaling_traces.py: Map I_before_scaling_pre_polar → I_before_scaling
    
    Evidence:
    - Pre-polar (941698.5) vs C (943654.8) → −0.207% (within tolerance)
    - Post-polar (861314.8) confirms consistency: C × polar ≈ PyTorch
    - Trace: 44 TRACE_PY lines with new pre/post-polar labels
    - Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/

Summary: Establish pyrefly supervision runway so static-analysis backlog can be delegated safely.
Mode: Docs
Focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 / Run pyrefly analysis and triage (docs/fix_plan.md)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/{commands.txt,summary.md,env.json,pyrefly.log}
Do Now: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase A (A1–A3). Run `rg -n "^\[tool\.pyrefly\]" pyproject.toml`, `pyrefly --version`, and scaffold `reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/` with empty `commands.txt` + `README.md`; record outputs per plan.
If Blocked: Capture missing-tool diagnostics in `reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/commands.txt`, add a TODO to docs/fix_plan.md noting install prerequisites, then halt before running any linters.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — Item now in_progress; needs Phase A evidence before any baseline scan.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md — Phase A defines the exact pre-flight checks; follow state columns.
- prompts/pyrefly.md — SOP forbids new tool installs; confirms two-message cadence for future loops.
- pyproject.toml:11 — `[tool.pyrefly]` entry is the configuration guard we must verify.
How-To Map:
- Commands: `rg -n "^\[tool\.pyrefly\]" pyproject.toml`; `pyrefly --version`.
- Artifact scaffold: `mkdir -p reports/pyrefly/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; touch `commands.txt` & `README.md` in that directory.
- Logging: Append the exact commands & outputs to `commands.txt`; note git SHA plus branch name.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not run `pyrefly check src` until Phase B.
- Keep reports under `reports/pyrefly/`; never commit logs.

**Evaluating next project phase and documentation**

I'm weighing where to focus next, leaning toward continuing the static pyrefly plan into Phase B with an evidence-gathering action. Before drafting any updates, I want to review relevant docs like prompts/pyrefly.md and the testing strategy to ensure I align input instructions with current goals. This approach helps me supervise progress thoughtfully without creating unnecessary new plans.

# Pyrefly Static Analysis Loop (Run & Fix)

Purpose
- Execute a single, fast loop to run configured static analysis (pyrefly) over `src/`, fix a small set of high‑confidence issues, validate with targeted tests, and commit. Keeps changes minimal and portable.

Autonomy & Messaging
- Do not ask what to do; act on this prompt.
- Only two messages: a short preamble, then the final Loop Output checklist.
- One item per loop; keep the scope minimal and surgical.

Preconditions & Inputs
- Tooling must be configured in‑repo. If `pyrefly` is not installed/available or `[tool.pyrefly]` is missing in `pyproject.toml`, do not introduce new tools in this loop. Instead, record a TODO in `docs/fix_plan.md` with a proposed dev/CI integration and exit after docs update.
- Read these before executing:
  - `./docs/index.md`
  - `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (see §1.5 Loop Execution Notes)
  - `./docs/fix_plan.md` (active item must be set `in_progress`)
  - `./input.md` (if present) — prefer its Do Now while maintaining one‑item execution

Ground Rules
- No new tools: use `pyrefly` only if already configured/available.

     2	- Initiative: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 — establish a repeatable static-analysis loop for `pyrefly` so we can triage violations and delegate fixes without blocking runtime work.
     3	- Phase Goal: Produce a clear, timestamped baseline of pyrefly diagnostics, map them to fix-plan priorities, and hand Ralph a scoped backlog with authoritative commands and artifact locations.
     4	- Dependencies: 
     5	  - `prompts/pyrefly.md` — SOP for running the static-analysis loop.
     6	  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §1.5 — testing cadence and command sourcing rules.

     9	  - Environment availability of the `pyrefly` CLI (verify via `command -v pyrefly`).
    10	- Artifact Policy: Store every run under `reports/pyrefly/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` with `commands.txt`, raw logs, `summary.md`, and `env.json`. Never commit these directories; reference them from fix_plan attempts.
    11	
    12	### Phase A — Preconditions & Tool Audit
    13	Goal: Confirm pyrefly is configured and document the command surface before any analysis run.
    14	Prereqs: Clean git status (aside from known WIP), docs/index.md reread, fix_plan entry marked active.
    15	Exit Criteria: Verified tool availability recorded, command plan captured, and reports directory prepared.

  2930	  * PyTorch: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE nanoBragg --config supervisor.yaml --oversample 2 --oversample-thick` with ROI matching C run.
  2931	  * Shapes/ROI: Oversample 2, oblique detector vectors from supervisor command, ROI ≈ 64×64 around a Bragg peak.
  2932	- First Divergence (if known): PyTorch intensity identical whether `oversample_thick` is enabled; C nanoBragg increases capture fraction on oblique pixels by ≥3%, confirming PyTorch path skips per-subpixel geometry.
  2933	- Next Actions:
  2934	  1. Execute plan Phase A (A1–A3) to capture failing pytest evidence, C comparison, and contract summary under `reports/2025-11-oversample-thick/`.
  2935	  2. Complete Phase B design notes describing tensor flow for `subpixel_coords_all` into `_apply_detector_absorption` and expected performance impact.
  2936	  3. Implement per-subpixel absorption (Phase C) with regression tests and run parity/perf validation plus documentation updates (Phase D).
  2937	- Attempts History:
  2938	  * [2025-11-17] Attempt #0 — Result: backlog entry. Logged bug description (pixel centers forwarded to absorption) and created plan `plans/active/oversample-thick-subpixel.md`; no code changes yet.
  2939	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure GPU/CPU parity; avoid introducing Python loops; maintain differentiability by keeping tensor operations (no `.item()`/`.numpy()`); track performance impact since subpixel absorption may increase compute cost.

     7	## 1. Introduction & Philosophy
     8	
     9	This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
    10	Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:
    11	
    12	1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
    13	2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
    14	3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.
    15	
    16	All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.
    17	
    18	### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline
    19	
    20	- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

Summary: Capture the STATIC-PYREFLY-001 baseline so we know the current pyrefly violations before delegating fixes.
Mode: Docs
Focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 / Run pyrefly analysis and triage (docs/fix_plan.md)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/{commands.txt,pyrefly.log,summary.md,env.json,README.md}
Do Now: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B1–B3 — run "'`pyrefly check src | tee reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/pyrefly.log`, capture exit status + env metadata, then draft summary.md grouping diagnostics by severity.
If Blocked: If pyrefly exits non-zero or CLI missing, record the full command + stderr + exit code in commands.txt, append a TODO + Attempt in docs/fix_plan.md, and stop before making code changes.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — Next actions already call for the Phase B baseline run; completing it unblocks triage and delegation.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:23 — Phase B checklist defines deliverables (log, env snapshot, grouped summary) we must produce this loop.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:35 — Step 1 requires capturing pyrefly output verbatim before attempting any fixes; follow the SOP literally.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:59 — Finalize step mandates logging commands + artifacts in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts, even for evidence-only loops.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:30 — Supervisor Do Now must cite authoritative commands; we avoid pytest runs here per evidence-only policy.
- pyproject.toml:9 — `[tool.pyrefly]` confirms config scope; verify against this stanza before trusting CLI defaults.
- docs/index.md:14 — Protected Assets reminder; ensure we do not modify indexed files while gathering logs.
- galph_memory.md (latest entry) — notes that Phase A succeeded with directory 20251008T053652Z; reuse it to keep artifacts organized.

How-To Map:
- Step 1: Confirm you are on branch `feature/spec-based-2` and worktree is clean with `git status --short`.
- Step 2: Re-read `docs/fix_plan.md` entry at lines 2943-2968 to align on success criteria before running commands.
- Step 3: Inspect `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/` (create if absent) and ensure `commands.txt` and `README.md` from Phase A remain; do not commit this directory.
- Step 4: Append the commands you plan to run to `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/commands.txt` before execution, noting UTC timestamps.
- Step 5: Execute `pyrefly check src | tee reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/pyrefly.log`; immediately record the exit status and runtime duration in commands.txt.
- Step 6: Capture environment metadata: run `python -V`, `pyrefly --version`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `python -m site` (or `env` for virtualenv info); collate into a well-formed JSON object stored at `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/env.json`.
- Step 7: Parse pyrefly.log, grouping findings by severity (blocker/high/medium/defer) and rule ID; note counts per group.
- Step 8: Draft `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/summary.md` with sections for Overview, Command & Exit Code, Findings by Severity, Deferred Items, and Next Steps; include file:line anchors for each finding.
- Step 9: Update `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/README.md` with a short Phase B status blurb referencing summary.md.
- Step 10: Append Attempt #2 under STATIC-PYREFLY-001 in docs/fix_plan.md, citing artifacts, exit status, and a ranked list of blocker/high findings (leave fixes for later phases).
- Step 11: Run `pytest --collect-only -q` ONLY if pyrefly highlights import errors that might block collection; otherwise, skip tests this loop per evidence-only gate.
- Step 12: Leave the working tree clean (no commits) unless documentation updates to docs/fix_plan.md are required; if edits were made, stage and prepare for supervisor commit next turn.
- Step 13: Record the loop outcome in `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/commands.txt` Attempts section, noting whether further investigation (Phase C) is needed immediately.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify source files or apply pyrefly auto-fixes; this loop is evidence-only per Mode: Docs.
- Avoid creating a new timestamp folder; Phase A established `20251008T053652Z` and should host all Phase B artifacts.
- Never commit `reports/pyrefly/` contents; confirm `.gitignore` coverage before staging files.
- Do not delete or edit Protected Assets listed in docs/index.md while updating documentation.
- Do not summarize findings without rule IDs and file:line anchors; Phase C relies on precise references.
- Avoid interpreting pyrefly severities heuristically; use the rule IDs and message text as reported.
- Refrain from running the full pytest suite; collect-only is permitted only if you must validate selectors mentioned in findings.
- Do not overwrite commands.txt history; append new entries with timestamps to preserve provenance from Phase A.
- Skip speculative fixes or TODO pruning until Phase C triage defines scope; just document what you observe.
- Ensure env.json is valid JSON (double quotes, proper commas) so downstream tooling can parse it without manual repair.

Summary: Capture the STATIC-PYREFLY-001 baseline so we know the current pyrefly violations before delegating fixes.
Mode: Docs
Focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 / Run pyrefly analysis and triage (docs/fix_plan.md)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/{commands.txt,pyrefly.log,summary.md,env.json,README.md}
Do Now: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B1–B3 — run "'`pyrefly check src | tee reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/pyrefly.log`, capture exit status + env metadata, then draft summary.md grouping diagnostics by severity.
If Blocked: If pyrefly exits non-zero or CLI missing, record the full command + stderr + exit code in commands.txt, append a TODO + Attempt in docs/fix_plan.md, and stop before making code changes.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — Next actions already call for the Phase B baseline run; completing it unblocks triage and delegation.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:23 — Phase B checklist defines deliverables (log, env snapshot, grouped summary) we must produce this loop.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:35 — Step 1 requires capturing pyrefly output verbatim before attempting any fixes; follow the SOP literally.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:59 — Finalize step mandates logging commands + artifacts in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts, even for evidence-only loops.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:30 — Supervisor Do Now must cite authoritative commands; we avoid pytest runs here per evidence-only policy.
- pyproject.toml:9 — `[tool.pyrefly]` confirms config scope; verify against this stanza before trusting CLI defaults.
- docs/index.md:14 — Protected Assets reminder; ensure we do not modify indexed files while gathering logs.
- galph_memory.md (latest entry) — notes that Phase A succeeded with directory 20251008T053652Z; reuse it to keep artifacts organized.

How-To Map:
- Step 1: Confirm you are on branch `feature/spec-based-2` and worktree is clean with `git status --short`.
- Step 2: Re-read `docs/fix_plan.md` entry at lines 2943-2968 to align on success criteria before running commands.
- Step 3: Inspect `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/` (create if absent) and ensure `commands.txt` and `README.md` from Phase A remain; do not commit this directory.
- Step 4: Append the commands you plan to run to `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/commands.txt` before execution, noting UTC timestamps.
- Step 5: Execute `pyrefly check src | tee reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/pyrefly.log`; immediately record the exit status and runtime duration in commands.txt.
- Step 6: Capture environment metadata: run `python -V`, `pyrefly --version`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and `python -m site` (or `env` for virtualenv info); collate into a well-formed JSON object stored at `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/env.json`.
- Step 7: Parse pyrefly.log, grouping findings by severity (blocker/high/medium/defer) and rule ID; note counts per group.

- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Collect-only pytest permitted for docs loops; plan ahead in case pyrefly flags import errors.

How-To Map:
- Step 1: Confirm you are on branch `feature/spec-based-2` and worktree is clean with `git status --short`.
- Step 2: Re-read `docs/fix_plan.md` entry at lines 2943-2968 to align on success criteria before running commands.

- Step 7: Validate JSON structure using `python -m json.tool reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/env.json > /tmp/env.pretty` and inspect the pretty output before overwriting the original.
- Step 8: Parse pyrefly.log, grouping findings by severity (blocker/high/medium/defer) and rule ID; note counts per group.
- Step 9: Create a scratchpad (e.g., `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/findings.tsv`) while triaging to avoid re-parsing logs; do not commit scratchpad.
- Step 10: Draft `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/summary.md` with sections for Overview, Command & Exit Code, Findings by Severity, Deferred Items, and Next Steps; include file:line anchors for each finding.
- Step 11: Update `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/README.md` with a short Phase B status blurb referencing summary.md and env.json.
- Step 12: Append Attempt #2 under STATIC-PYREFLY-001 in docs/fix_plan.md, citing artifacts, exit status, and a ranked list of blocker/high findings (leave fixes for later phases).
- Step 13: Add a note in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt about whether follow-up requires collect-only pytest or code changes, so future loops know the gating conditions.
- Step 14: Run `pytest --collect-only -q` ONLY if pyrefly highlights import errors that might block collection; otherwise, skip tests this loop per evidence-only gate.
- Step 15: Double-check that no tracked files were modified inadvertently with `git status --short`; revert accidental edits before finishing.
- Step 16: Record the loop outcome in `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/commands.txt` Attempts section, noting whether further investigation (Phase C) is needed immediately.
- Step 17: Ensure timestamps use UTC (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) for reproducibility; add them beside each command entry.
- Step 18: Capture any CLI warnings or deprecation notices verbatim in summary.md so Phase C can weigh urgency.
- Step 19: If pyrefly output references configuration adjustments, cross-check with `pyproject.toml` before documenting potential remediation paths.
- Step 20: Before ending the loop, skim `summary.md` for accidental secrets or PII (none expected) and confirm wording is concise yet actionable.
- Step 21: Back up pyrefly.log to a temporary location if you plan to filter it; always keep an unedited copy in the reports directory.
- Step 22: Leave TODO placeholders (e.g., `- [ ] OWNER?`) in summary.md for findings that clearly map to other initiatives; Phase C will replace them with concrete assignments.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify source files or apply pyrefly auto-fixes; this loop is evidence-only per Mode: Docs.
- Avoid creating a new timestamp folder; Phase A established `20251008T053652Z` and should host all Phase B artifacts.
- Never commit `reports/pyrefly/` contents; confirm `.gitignore` coverage before staging files.
- Do not delete or edit Protected Assets listed in docs/index.md while updating documentation.
- Do not summarize findings without rule IDs and file:line anchors; Phase C relies on precise references.
- Avoid interpreting pyrefly severities heuristically; use the rule IDs and message text as reported.
- Refrain from running the full pytest suite; collect-only is permitted only if you must validate selectors mentioned in findings.
- Do not overwrite commands.txt history; append new entries with timestamps to preserve provenance from Phase A.
- Skip speculative fixes or TODO pruning until Phase C triage defines scope; just document what you observe.
- Ensure env.json is valid JSON (double quotes, proper commas) so downstream tooling can parse it without manual repair.
- Resist the urge to condense multiple findings into one bullet; separate entries keep delegation manageable.
- Do not replace pyrefly.log with a filtered version; store filters separately if needed for readability.
- Avoid referencing private developer machines or paths in summary.md; keep notes portable and repo-relative.
- Do not assume rule severities; if uncertain, copy the pyrefly classification verbatim into summary.md.
- Prevent accidental whitespace cleanup in docs/fix_plan.md outside the Attempt block; maintain existing formatting.

Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — STATIC-PYREFLY-001 ledger with current Attempt history and required evidence.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:23 — Phase B table describing required artifacts (pyrefly.log, env.json, summary.md).
- prompts/pyrefly.md:19 — Ground rules covering tool usage, artifact storage, and two-message cadence.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:35 — Step 1 reproduction instructions for capturing pyrefly output verbatim.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:47 — Step 3 reminds us no fixes in this pass; cite when resisting edits.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:58 — Step 5 finalize instructions for updating docs/fix_plan.md and keeping artifacts offline.
- pyproject.toml:9 — Location of `[tool.pyrefly]` block confirming repository configuration.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:28 — Loop execution notes dictating when collect-only pytest is appropriate.
- docs/index.md:14 — Protected-asset list underpinning the no-touch rule during evidence collection.
- galph_memory.md (latest entry) — Documents that Phase A completed; ensure your Attempt #2 references the same directory and momentum.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md — Example of artifact summary structure to mimic in pyrefly summary.md for consistency.
- input.md (previous revision) — Review prior Mode and Do Now to maintain continuity; document differences explicitly in summary.md.

Documentation Checklist:
- [ ] commands.txt updated with every command, timestamp, and exit status.
- [ ] pyrefly.log captured without truncation (confirm file size reasonable and includes header/footer).
- [ ] env.json validated through `python -m json.tool` before finalizing.
- [ ] summary.md includes Overview, Severity Buckets, Deferred Items, Next Steps, and Artifact Paths sections.
- [ ] README.md refreshed with Phase B completion note and links to summary.md/env.json.
- [ ] docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #2 appended with metrics, artifacts, and follow-up bullets.
- [ ] No other repo files modified; `git status --short` clean at loop end.
- [ ] Notes on potential cross-initiative impact (e.g., CLI, detector) recorded in summary.md for Phase C triage.
- [ ] commands.txt end-of-loop entry captures whether collect-only pytest was required.
- [ ] Summary explicitly states Mode: Docs / evidence-only so history stays clear.

Next Up:
- Phase C (plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:34) — Once summary.md exists, prepare to classify findings and map them to owners/tests.
- CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M (plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:72) — Hold until pyrefly backlog is triaged; note this in docs/fix_plan.md next actions if findings touch CLI code.

- Skip speculative fixes or TODO pruning until Phase C triage defines scope; just document what you observe.
- Ensure env.json is valid JSON (double quotes, proper commas) so downstream tooling can parse it without manual repair.
- Resist the urge to condense multiple findings into one bullet; separate entries keep delegation manageable.
- Do not replace pyrefly.log with a filtered version; store filters separately if needed for readability.
- Avoid referencing private developer machines or paths in summary.md; keep notes portable and repo-relative.
- Do not assume rule severities; if uncertain, copy the pyrefly classification verbatim into summary.md.
- Prevent accidental whitespace cleanup in docs/fix_plan.md outside the Attempt block; maintain existing formatting.

Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — STATIC-PYREFLY-001 ledger with current Attempt history and required evidence.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:23 — Phase B table describing required artifacts (pyrefly.log, env.json, summary.md).
- prompts/pyrefly.md:19 — Ground rules covering tool usage, artifact storage, and two-message cadence.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:35 — Step 1 reproduction instructions for capturing pyrefly output verbatim.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:47 — Step 3 reminds us no fixes in this pass; cite when resisting edits.
- prompts/pyrefly.md:58 — Step 5 finalize instructions for updating docs/fix_plan.md and keeping artifacts offline.
- pyproject.toml:9 — Location of `[tool.pyrefly]` block confirming repository configuration.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:28 — Loop execution notes dictating when collect-only pytest is appropriate.
- docs/index.md:14 — Protected-asset list underpinning the no-touch rule during evidence collection.
- galph_memory.md (latest entry) — Documents that Phase A completed; ensure your Attempt #2 references the same directory and momentum.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md — Example of artifact summary structure to mimic in pyrefly summary.md for consistency.
- input.md (previous revision) — Review prior Mode and Do Now to maintain continuity; document differences explicitly in summary.md.

Documentation Checklist:
- [ ] commands.txt updated with every command, timestamp, and exit status.
- [ ] pyrefly.log captured without truncation (confirm file size reasonable and includes header/footer).
- [ ] env.json validated through `python -m json.tool` before finalizing.
- [ ] summary.md includes Overview, Severity Buckets, Deferred Items, Next Steps, and Artifact Paths sections.
- [ ] README.md refreshed with Phase B completion note and links to summary.md/env.json.
- [ ] docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #2 appended with metrics, artifacts, and follow-up bullets.
- [ ] No other repo files modified; `git status --short` clean at loop end.
- [ ] Notes on potential cross-initiative impact (e.g., CLI, detector) recorded in summary.md for Phase C triage.
- [ ] commands.txt end-of-loop entry captures whether collect-only pytest was required.
- [ ] Summary explicitly states Mode: Docs / evidence-only so history stays clear.

Next Up:
- Phase C (plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:34) — Once summary.md exists, prepare to classify findings and map them to owners/tests.
- CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M (plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:72) — Hold until pyrefly backlog is triaged; note this in docs/fix_plan.md next actions if findings touch CLI code.

## 2025-10-08 (galph loop — STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B setup)
- Coin flip→heads: reviewed Ralph’s recent commits ("'`ef1f716`, `e97a66c`) and found them productive; Phase M1 instrumentation landed cleanly and pyrefly Phase A evidence captured without regressions.
- Chosen focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B baseline run; no new plan required since `plans/active/static-pyrefly.md` already governs the workflow.
- Actions this loop: refreshed `input.md` with Docs-mode guidance covering Phase B1–B3 deliverables (pyrefly.log, env.json, summary.md, fix_plan Attempt update) and reiterated artifact/timestamp reuse under `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/`.
- No changes to docs/fix_plan.md this turn; expect Ralph to record Attempt #2 after the baseline run and keep the working tree clean.
- Follow-up: next supervisor loop should inspect the new summary, decide on Phase C triage scope, and ensure pyrefly findings are mapped to owners/tests before delegating fixes.

**Composing final update message**

I'm preparing a concise final message summarizing completed tasks, evaluation results, and next steps for Ralph. I'll use a bullet list to highlight key updates like changes in `input.md` and `galph_memory.md` with line references, note the review of Ralph’s commits, mention no tests were run, and include instructions for Ralph to run the pyrefly baseline. This will keep things clear and organized.
[2025-10-08T05:45:08] codex

**Update**
- Replaced `input.md:1-126` with Docs-mode guidance for STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B (baseline `pyrefly check src`, env capture, summary drafting, fix_plan Attempt #2) and added reference command set so Ralph can reuse `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/`.
- Logged this loop in `galph_memory.md:92-97`, noting the coin-flip review (heads) of Ralph’s recent commits (`ef1f716`, `e97a66c`) and the plan to inspect pyrefly findings next run.

**Observations**
- Ralph’s latest work looks healthy: Phase M1 instrumentation commit aligns traces, and Phase A pyrefly prep was executed per plan.
- No additional plan changes needed; existing `plans/active/static-pyrefly.md` already covers the upcoming triage.

**Next Steps**
- Ralph should follow `input.md` to run the pyrefly baseline, populate `summary.md`, and log Attempt #2 in `docs/fix_plan.md:2943`.
- Supervisor to review the new pyrefly artifacts next loop and decide on Phase C delegation once diagnostics are available.

No tests were run this turn.
