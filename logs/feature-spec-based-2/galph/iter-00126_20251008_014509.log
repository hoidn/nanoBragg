in order of decreasing priority:
<1>
run a successful parallel test of pytorch nanobragg against nanobragg c with this command:

this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## 2025-11-28 (galph loop — CLI parity shim push)
- Re-synced (no upstream changes) and reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 + parity-shim plan; spec remains φ=0 carryover-free (specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214) while C bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-182.
- Selected focus = CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3k.3c.4; no new plan needed. Input memo now steers Ralph to implement the opt-in φ carryover shim (Plan Phase C1–C5) with per-φ trace evidence and dual-mode tests.
- No fix_plan or plan edits required this turn; parity shim plan already authoritative. Next supervisor check: confirm reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/... artifacts exist, docs/fix_plan attempt logged, and tests cover both spec/parity modes before advancing to L3k.3c.5.

## 2025-11-28 (galph loop — vectorization plan sync)
- Reviewed spec/core docs for tricubic interpolation (specs/spec-a-core.md:230, 595) and confirmed φ carryover bug remains quarantined in docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md.
- Marked Phase D1 as complete in `plans/active/vectorization.md` (Attempt #8 worksheet) and refreshed status snapshot to reference `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md`.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Next Actions to drop the stale D1 todo and point Ralph toward D2–D4 with the new evidence requirements.
- Issued Perf-mode `input.md` directing Ralph to author failing `TestTricubicPoly` coverage (Phase D3) before implementing vectorized helpers.
- Follow-up: Expect next loop to land D2 vectorized polynomials, record CPU/CUDA pytest logs under phase_d/, and log a new Attempt once tests go green.

## 2025-11-29 (galph loop — Phase D2 kickoff)
- Reconfirmed VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 status: Phase D1 complete, D3 xfail tests present (`tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py:332-735`). Scalar helpers in `src/nanobrag_torch/utils/physics.py:315-443` still unvectorized; `_tricubic_interpolation` continues to fall back to nearest-neighbour for B>1.
- Action: Maintained existing plan, but issued new Perf-mode `input.md` directing Ralph to implement `polint_vectorized`/`polin2_vectorized`/`polin3_vectorized`, wire them into the batched path, remove the fallback warning, and capture CPU/CUDA pytest logs under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`.
- Expectations logged: update `implementation_notes.md`, rerun `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly`, then hit `tests/test_at_str_002.py::TestStructureFactorInterpolation::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled`, and record a new Attempt in `docs/fix_plan.md` marking plan row D2 [D].
- Follow-up for Ralph: land D2 implementation, produce the requested artifacts/logs, and be ready to progress to Plan Phase D4 once the vectorized helpers pass.

The PyTorch implementation **MUST** maintain end-to-end differentiability to enable gradient-based optimization. This is a fundamental architectural requirement that affects every design decision.

### Mandatory Rules

1. **Never Use `.item()` on Differentiable Tensors**
   - **Forbidden:** `config = Config(param=tensor.item())` — permanently severs computation graph
   - **Correct:** `config = Config(param=tensor)` — preserves gradient flow
   - **Rationale:** `.item()` extracts a Python scalar, completely detaching from autograd

2. **Avoid `torch.linspace` for Gradient-Critical Code**
   - **Problem:** `torch.linspace` doesn't preserve gradients from tensor endpoints
   - **Forbidden:** `torch.linspace(start_tensor, end_tensor, steps)` where tensors require gradients
   - **Correct:** `start_tensor + (end_tensor - start_tensor) * torch.arange(steps) / (steps - 1)`
   - **Alternative:** Use manual tensor arithmetic for all range generation needing gradients

3. **Implement Derived Properties as Functions**
   - **Forbidden:** Overwriting class attributes with computed values (e.g., `self.a_star = calculate_reciprocal()`)
   - **Correct:** Use `@property` decorators that recalculate from base parameters each access
   - **Example:** Crystal reciprocal vectors must be computed from cell parameters on-demand

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Step 3: Identify break
if isinstance(config.phi_start_deg, float):
    print("ERROR: Gradient lost - tensor converted to float")
```

**Solutions:**
- Replace `.item()` with direct tensor passing
- Use manual tensor arithmetic instead of `torch.linspace`
- Enforce tensor inputs at architectural boundaries  

### Coordinate System Issues

**Symptoms:** 90-degree rotated images, incorrect peak positions  
**First step:** Verify pixel coordinate calculations in trace  
**Common causes:** `torch.meshgrid` indexing, axis orientation

### Performance Issues

1. Reduce detector size for debugging
2. Use CPU for initial debugging, GPU for performance testing
3. Profile memory usage during trace generation

## End-to-End Verification (verify_detector_geometry.py)

For high-level, end-to-end validation, the `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py` script is the primary tool. It runs both the PyTorch and C-code simulations for a given configuration and produces a detailed visual comparison and a JSON file with correlation metrics. This should be used to confirm that a fix is complete and has not introduced regressions.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically executes both PyTorch and C implementations
- Generates side-by-side comparison plots
- Computes quantitative correlation metrics
- Uses `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` for C-code execution
- Uses `scripts/smv_parser.py` for reading C-code output images

**Usage:**

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-27 refresh → galph loop i=118):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (parity shim evidence capture)** — Follow `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C4 to rerun `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` for both spec and `--phi-carryover-mode c-parity`; store logs, delta metrics, and SHA256 hashes under a new `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/` directory and confirm VG-1 tolerances (Δrot_b_y, Δk ≤ 1e-6) in parity mode. Include targeted pytest output (`tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py`, `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py`) alongside traces.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (dual-mode documentation/tests)** — After traces land, execute Phase C5 and Phase D1 of the parity-shim plan: update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md`, and related checklists to document the opt-in shim, and ensure collect-only evidence exists for both spec/parity selectors.
3. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-21] Attempt #95 (galph supervisor loop) — Result: **PLANNING UPDATE** (Phase L3k added). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Planning-only (no tests executed).
    Artifacts:
      - `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` — New Phase L3k section outlining implementation gates.
      - `docs/fix_plan.md` — Next Actions retargeted to Phase L3k; checklist referenced.

9:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
23:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-22): Attempt #101 (L3k.3b evidence loop) regenerated per-φ PyTorch traces and confirmed k_frac span=1.8088e-2. No matching `TRACE_C_PHI` lines exist in the current C trace, so the comparison tooling falsely reports "parity achieved." Phase L3k now requires explicit instrumentation of the golden C binary plus a guard that treats missing C data as a blocking failure before nb-compare/ROI work resumes.
37:- Gap snapshot recap (2025-11-22): L3k.2 landed (Attempt #97) with reciprocal recompute + docstring, VG-2 passed (Attempt #98), but VG-1/VG-3 failed (Attempt #99) — k_frac span 1.8×10⁻², correlation 0.985, sum_ratio 1.16×10⁵ because the C ROI sum came back ≈0. Attempt #100 realigned the φ=0 tests to the supervisor spindle axis so the drift is now captured in red tests. Focus next: diagnose the residual φ rotation error, fix the nb-compare ROI anomaly, then rerun VG-1⇢VG-4 before logging L3k.4.
279:| L3j.3 | Sync plan + fix_plan | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #96: Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 with Attempt #96 entry documenting Phase L3k.1 completion (implementation memo), artifact paths, root cause analysis, proposed fix strategy, and next actions for code implementation loop. Documented Mode: Docs constraint (no code changes this loop). Updated this plan to mark L3k.1 complete. pytest --collect-only deferred to implementation loop. |
281:### Phase L3k — φ Rotation Fix Implementation
288:| L3k.1 | Author implementation memo + docstring reference | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #96 (ralph Mode: Docs): Appended Phase L3k Implementation Memo to `mosflm_matrix_correction.md:187-297` documenting root cause (independent rotation of real+reciprocal vectors), C reference (nanoBragg.c:3044-3066), proposed fix (rotate only real, recompute reciprocal from cross products), implementation strategy (preserve vectorization/device neutrality), and verification thresholds (VG-1⇢VG-5). C-code docstring reference requirement documented for L3k.2. Artifacts: implementation memo, updated fix_plan Attempt #96, updated this plan L3j.3→[D]. Mode: Docs → no code changes; docstring addition deferred to implementation loop. |
289:| L3k.2 | Implement φ rotation fix | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #97 (ralph loop i=97): Fixed `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors` (crystal.py:1008-1035) to rotate ONLY real vectors, then recompute reciprocal via cross products and V_actual per CLAUDE Rule #13. Added C-code docstring reference (lines 1010-1013) per CLAUDE Rule #11. Preserved vectorization, device neutrality, gradient flow. Metrics: test_f_latt_square_matches_c PASSED (5.79s), 57 crystal/geometry tests PASSED, 653 tests collected. Artifacts: crystal.py:1008-1035 (fixed implementation), Attempt #97 in fix_plan.md. |
290:| L3k.3 | Execute verification gates VG-1⇢VG-5 | [P] | Attempt #98 cleared VG-2, Attempt #99 exposed the remaining gaps (k_frac span 1.8e-2, correlation 0.985, sum_ratio 1.16e5), and Attempt #108 captured φ=0 PyTorch state probes while flagging the C trace dependency. After Attempt #115 landed the spec-compliant rotation, VG-1 now hinges on locking spec baselines (rot_b_y=0.7173197865 Å, k_frac=1.6756687164) and proving ≤1e-6 deltas on CPU+CUDA before resuming nb-compare work. Continue to store artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` (base_vector_debug/, per_phi_postfix/) and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/nb_compare_phi_fix/`. |
292:#### L3k.3 Checklist — φ=0 Verification Recovery
296:| L3k.3a | Align φ=0 harness/tests with supervisor spindle axis | [D] | ✅ Attempt #100 updated `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to set `spindle_axis=[-1,0,0]`, producing the expected red baseline (rot_b drift, k_frac delta). Keep these tests red until the physics fix lands; rerun `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py -k "phi0" -vv` after each patch. |
297:| L3k.3b | Restore C↔Py per-φ comparison pipeline | [D] | ✅ Attempt #109 (2025-11-23) rebuilt the instrumented C binary, captured `c_trace_phi_20251123.log`, reran `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py`, and populated `delta_metrics.json` (Δk=1.8116e-2 @ φ=0, Δk≤2.85e-5 elsewhere). Artifacts: `base_vector_debug/20251123/` trace set, updated comparison summary. |
298:| L3k.3c | Patch φ rotation & confirm VG-1 thresholds | [ ] | **Status 2025-11-27:** Spec-compliant rotation is merged (Attempt #115) and rot_b meets tolerance; VG-1 remains open because k_frac still relies on a “differs from C bug” assertion. Record authoritative spec baselines (rot_b_y, k_frac) under a new `base_vector_debug/<timestamp>/` capture, update the pytest expectations to those numbers with ≤1e-6 tolerances, and rerun the per-φ harness on CPU+CUDA until `delta_metrics.json` reports max Δk, Δb_y ≤1e-6. Only then proceed to nb-compare gates. |
299:| L3k.3d | Resolve nb-compare ROI parity (VG-3/VG-4) | [ ] | Investigate the C ROI zero-sum issue (ROI bounds, image loader, dtype). Once resolved, rerun `nb-compare --roi` to hit correlation ≥0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, and component deltas meeting VG-4 thresholds. Record metrics in `vg3_metrics.txt` and update `fix_checklist.md`. |
300:| L3k.3e | Finalize documentation + checklist (VG-5) | [ ] | When VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, mark remaining rows in `fix_checklist.md` ✅, append resolutions to `mosflm_matrix_correction.md`, and prep notes for the L3k.4 attempt log. |
301:| L3k.4 | Log Attempt + plan sync | [ ] | **BLOCKED on L3k.3 completion.** Append new Attempt entry in `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (correlation, sum_ratio, b_Y delta, k_frac delta from VG artifacts), reference all artifact paths (per-φ traces, pytest log, nb-compare summary, updated checklist), document observations (H5 confirmed, thresholds met), and flip L3k.1–L3k.4 rows to [D] in this plan. Update Next Actions to proceed to Phase L4 supervisor command parity rerun. |
303:#### L3k.3c Tasks — Restore φ=0 Parity with C Reference
307:| L3k.3c.1 | Reinstate C-aligned assertions | [D] | ✅ Attempt #103 (2025-10-07) restored the C expectations in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py`, leaving both φ=0 parity tests failing against the C reference. Artifact: `reports/.../pytest_phi0_regression.log`. Keep these assertions active so the fix cannot be masked. |
308:| L3k.3c.2 | Diagnose φ=0 state carryover | [D] | Attempt #109 captured paired traces under `base_vector_debug/20251123/`, recorded Δk=1.8116×10⁻² and Δb_y=4.573155×10⁻² Å in `diagnosis.md` + `delta_by.txt`, and documented the carryover remediation plan (cache φ_last → reuse at φ_tic=0 with nanoBragg.c:3044 guard). |
309:| L3k.3c.3 | Lock spec φ=0 baselines & tighten tests | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-07 Attempt #118 (ralph Mode: Parity/Evidence): Captured spec baseline evidence under `base_vector_debug/20251007T231515Z/`. Tests PASSED (2/2 in 2.14s): rot_b[0,0,1]=0.7173197865 Å (≤1e-6 ✓), k_frac(φ=0)=1.6756687164 (≤1e-6 ✓). Artifacts: metadata.txt (torch 2.8.0+cu128, git 4cb561b), pytest_phi0.log, sha256.txt (checksums), comparison_summary.md (full evidence). VG-1 satisfied on CPU; CUDA smoke deferred to next loop. Next: L3k.3c.4 C-parity shim design. Reference: docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #118. |
310:| L3k.3c.4 | Design explicit C-parity carryover shim | [P] | Implementation landed (see `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C1–C3, docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #120). 2025-10-08 evidence run (`parity_shim/20251008T011326Z`) shows shim still drifting (Δk≈2.845e-05 > 1e-6); keep Phase C4 open until parity tolerances are met and fresh TRACE_C_PHI logs are captured. |

### C-PARITY-001 — φ=0 Uses Stale Crystal Vectors (Medium)
**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel’s final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-11-27): Spec baseline locked (VG-1 met with ≤1e-6 deltas); parity shim not yet designed. Default path removes `_phi_last_cache`. Need explicit toggle plus regression coverage before L4 supervisor command rerun.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

Phase D is the active gate before parity/perf validation (Phase E) and absorption work (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

**Assessing phase D vectorization status**

I'm sorting through conflicting notes about phase D tasks—some say D2 and related vectorization work is done, others suggest parts remain pending. I'll dig deeper into the active plans and specs, focusing on long-term goals like the CLI and phi bug, to clarify what’s completed and what still needs attention.

Summary: Bring the c-parity shim within VG-1 by eliminating the 2.845e-05 residual Δk drift vs the C trace.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase L3k.3c.4 parity shim evidence capture
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py::TestPhiCarryoverBehavior; tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/trace_py_spec*.{log,json}; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/trace_py_c_parity*.{log,json}; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/c_trace_phi.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/delta_metrics.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/pytest_phi*.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/sha256.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3k.3c.4 — after fixing the φ carryover logic, rerun the parity trace harness for both modes via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --dtype float64 --device cpu --phi-mode <mode> --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/trace_py_<mode>.log` and regenerate the matching `TRACE_C_PHI` log, then recompute `delta_metrics.json`.
If Blocked: Capture failing command + stderr to `<outdir>/attempt_fail.log`, keep the tree untouched, and document the blocker + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history before stopping.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:309 marks L3k.3c.4 as [P]; VG-1 requires Δk, ΔF_latt_b ≤1e-6/1e-4 before we can advance to documentation and nb-compare phases.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md:47-55 calls for ≤1e-6 parity in c-parity mode; today’s run (20251008T011326Z) still sits at 2.845e-05, so shim logic needs refinement.
- docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #122 records the regression and the missing TRACE_C_PHI instrumentation; resolving both is prerequisite for credible parity evidence.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 defines the C reference behavior—use it to ensure the optional shim matches the bug without altering the spec-default path.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 keep the primary contract (identity rotation at φ=0); any fix must leave spec mode untouched while tightening the parity mode.
How-To Map:
- Restore TRACE_C instrumentation if needed: `pushd golden_suite_generator && patch -p1 < ../c_instrumentation.patch && make && popd` (or re-apply the existing TRACE_C_PHI edits manually, then rebuild). Confirm `TRACE_C_PHI` appears before re-running comparisons.
- Prepare outdir: `timestamp=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ); outdir=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/$timestamp; mkdir -p "$outdir"`.
- Spec run: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --dtype float64 --device cpu --phi-mode spec --out "$outdir/trace_py_spec.log"`.
- C-parity run: same command with `--phi-mode c-parity` and output `trace_py_c_parity.log`.
- Copy per-φ JSON/log/env/config into `$outdir` (rename with `_spec` / `_c_parity` suffixes) before the second run overwrites them.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–C complete; Phase D polynomial vectorization pending)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --device cpu` (and `--device cuda`), plus `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` for detector absorption timing.
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-29 refresh → galph supervision):
  1. Phase D4 — Execute CPU + CUDA sweeps (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v`) storing logs under `phase_d/pytest_cpu.log` & `phase_d/pytest_cuda.log`; record timings + device metadata in `polynomial_validation.md`.
  2. Phase E staging — Populate `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/` with collect-only output, benchmark command templates, and ROI notes ahead of parity/perf validation.
  3. Phase E1–E3 — Re-run tricubic acceptance & regression suites post-vectorization, execute `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (CPU+CUDA) to compare against Phase A baselines, and summarise results in `phase_e/summary.md`.
  4. Phase F design prep — Draft absorption vectorization design note (`phase_f/design_notes.md`) so detector absorption work can start immediately after Phase E closure.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.
    Metrics: AT-STR-002: 3/3 tests passed in 2.12s (test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled, test_tricubic_out_of_bounds_fallback, test_auto_enable_interpolation). AT-ABS-001: 5/5 tests passed in 5.88s. Collection: 3 tricubic tests found.

**Verifying fix_plan and main plan consistency**

I see some contradictions between fix_plan's Next Actions and the main plan regarding Phase D4's status, so I'll check the fix_plan attempts beyond what I saw to confirm if D4 is complete and update the plan accordingly.

    Artifacts:

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Assertions guard against silent regressions once polynomial vectorization lands by enforcing `(B,4,4,4)` tensor layout and output shape parity.
      - Device checks confirmed gather outputs stay on the caller’s device (CPU/CUDA), eliminating hidden host/device drift before Phase D.
      - Audit verified `_tricubic_interpolation` performs no caching; notes instruct future caching layers to mirror the device assertions.

      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md` — 15-section worksheet specifying tensor shapes `(B,4)→(B,)` for polint, `(B,4,4)→(B,)` for polin2, `(B,4,4,4)→(B,)` for polin3; C-code docstring templates per CLAUDE Rule #11 (nanoBragg.c lines 4150-4187); gradient validation strategy (gradcheck with float64, eps=1e-6, atol=1e-4); device coverage plan (CPU+CUDA parametrised tests); tap point inventory for parity debugging; performance baselines from Phase A (CPU ~1.4ms/call, CUDA ~5.5ms/call) with ≥10× speedup target; masking/NaN handling strategies; 10 new unit tests enumerated.
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log` — Test collection proof (5 gather tests from Phase C).
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Worksheet defines complete binding contract between Phase C gather infrastructure `(B,4,4,4)` outputs and Phase D polynomial evaluation requirements.
      - All three helpers (polint/polin2/polin3) follow nested structure from C-code: polin2 stacks 4× polint, polin3 stacks 4× polin2, enabling torch.compile fusion.
      - Gradient flow ensured via explicit anti-patterns: no `.item()`, no `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints, clamp denominators to avoid NaN.

    Next Actions: Phase D2 — Implement batched `polint_vectorized`, `polin2_vectorized`, `polin3_vectorized` in `src/nanobrag_torch/utils/physics.py` following worksheet Section 3 C-code reference templates (nanoBragg.c lines 4150-4187); ensure gradient preservation (no `.item()`, clamp denominators), device neutrality (infer from inputs), and dtype neutrality; transition tests from XFAIL→PASS; capture CPU+CUDA logs under `phase_d/pytest_cpu.log` & `phase_d/pytest_cuda.log` after implementation.
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #10 (ralph loop #122, Mode: Code) — Result: **Phase D2 COMPLETE** (vectorized polynomial helpers implemented and validated). Batched tricubic interpolation now fully functional.
    Metrics: Tests: 19/19 passed in 2.46s (11 polynomial unit tests + 8 gather/acceptance tests). Polynomial tests: scalar equivalence verified (max diff <1e-12), gradient flow confirmed (gradcheck eps=1e-6, atol=1e-4), device neutrality validated (CPU + CUDA), dtype neutrality confirmed (float32 + float64). Acceptance tests (AT-STR-002): 3/3 passed with no fallback warnings. Commit: f796861.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/utils/physics.py` lines 447-610 — Added `polint_vectorized`, `polin2_vectorized`, `polin3_vectorized` with C-code docstrings per CLAUDE Rule #11 (nanoBragg.c:4150-4187)
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` lines 436-482 — Updated `_tricubic_interpolation` batched path to call `polin3_vectorized`, removed nearest-neighbor fallback warning
      - `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` — Removed xfail markers from 11 polynomial tests (now all passing)
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu_pass.log` — Full CPU test run (11 polynomial + 8 gather/acceptance = 19 passed)
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/at_str_002_pass.log` — AT-STR-002 acceptance test log (3/3 passed)
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md` — Complete Phase D2 summary with design decisions, test results, artifacts
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Initial denominator clamping attempt caused catastrophic numerical errors (~10²⁸ outputs instead of ~1); removed clamping since integer-spaced HKL grids never produce near-zero denominators
      - Nested loop vectorization: 4-element iteration over polynomial slices (j=0..3) kept as Python loop for readability; batched operations (`polint_vectorized` on `(B,4)` inputs) amortize overhead
      - Device/dtype neutrality achieved via tensor inheritance: all intermediate tensors use same device/dtype as inputs, no explicit `.to()` calls
      - Gradient flow preserved: no `.item()`, `.detach()`, or `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints; all operations are differentiable
      - Batched path now active for B>1: eliminates "WARNING: polynomial evaluation not yet vectorized; falling back to nearest-neighbor"
      - Scalar path (B==1) preserved for backward compatibility, continues using existing `polin3` helper
      - Shape assertions in `crystal.py` ensure `(B,)` output from vectorized helpers matches expected detector grid after reshape

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-11-27): Phases A–C complete with gather vectorization merged (commit 12742e5). Phase D1 worksheet captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md`; polynomial helpers remain scalar (D2–D4 pending) and detector absorption is still looped. Phase D is the active gate before parity/perf validation (Phase E) and absorption work (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

**Preparing to update vectorization plan**

I notice the plan progress is inconsistent with the status summary, so I’m focusing on updating the plan to reflect the current state around vectorization and performance. Before making plan edits, I want to review documentation and relevant artifacts, like specs and reports, to ground the updates in accurate info. This groundwork feels important to get the plan aligned and actionable.

**Preparing plan update and documentation review**

I’m mapping out how to revise the phased implementation plan by updating statuses and next steps to show D-phase completion and prepping for Phase E tasks. To do this thoroughly, I need to gather key documents—especially specs and architecture guides—so I can reference them properly in the plan and in the associated fix_plan.md. I'll also consider detailed checklist additions for upcoming phases and keep formatting consistent while editing plans/active/vectorization.md. Let's dive into the relevant docs to ensure all references and steps align with the new phase transitions!

I'm outlining updates to the vectorization plan and fix_plan documentation to reflect completion of Phases A–D and introduce detailed Phase E tasks with statuses, log file references, test results, and verification instructions. My focus is on applying precise patches to these large markdown files to revise status lines, Next Actions, and add checklists and metric thresholds, ensuring everything aligns with recent progress and upcoming validation work.

**Updating plan and preparing documentation review**

I’m making sure the plan update aligns with formatting and capturing new tasks. Before moving to rendering input.md, I need to dig into documentation—especially to check docs/index and possibly pytorch_runtime_checklist.md—so I can instruct Ralph properly and include those insights in the final summary.

# PyTorch Runtime Checklist

Use this quick checklist before and after every PyTorch simulator edit. It distills the authoritative guidance from
`docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the testing strategy.

1. **Vectorization**
   - Do not reintroduce Python loops that duplicate work already handled by batched tensor code.
   - When adding a new flow (sources, phi, mosaic, oversample), extend the existing broadcast shapes instead of looping.
   - Verify `_compute_physics_for_position` receives tensors with the expected batch dimensions.

2. **Device & Dtype Neutrality**
   - **Default dtype is float32** for performance and memory efficiency. Precision-critical operations (gradient checks, metric duality) explicitly override to float64 where required.
   - Materialize configuration tensors (beam, detector, crystal) on the execution device before the main loop.
   - Avoid per-iteration `.to()`, `.cpu()`, `.cuda()`, or tensor factories (`torch.tensor(...)`) inside compiled regions; cache constants once.
   - Run CPU **and** CUDA smoke commands (`pytest -v -m gpu_smoke`) when a GPU is available.

3. **torch.compile Hygiene**
   - Watch the console for Dynamo “graph break” warnings; treat them as blockers.
   - Benchmarks should reuse compiled functions; avoid changing shapes every call unless batching logic handles it.

**Drafting detailed input.md plan**

I’m putting together the full input.md file with the summary, mapped tests, exact run commands for CPU and GPU, logs, pitfalls, priorities, pointers, and next steps. I'll make sure to follow the detailed structure, including environment capture and instructions for log directories, to align precisely with the phase E regression testing plan.

Summary: Capture CPU/GPU parity evidence for the vectorized tricubic path to unlock Phase E.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase E1 parity/perf validation kickoff
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py; tests/test_at_str_002.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase E1 — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v
If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
- plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
- specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
- Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
- Re-run with CUDA by prefixing "'`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
- Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
- After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
- No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
- Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
- Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
- Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
- Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
- Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
- Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
- plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
Next Up:
- Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.

Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase E1 — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v
If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
- plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
- specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
- Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
- Re-run with CUDA by prefixing "'`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
- Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
- After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
- No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
- Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
- Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
- Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
- Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
- Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
- Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
- plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
Next Up:
- Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.

Summary: Capture CPU/GPU parity evidence for the vectorized tricubic path to unlock Phase E.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase E1 parity/perf validation kickoff
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py; tests/test_at_str_002.py

Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase E1 — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
- plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
- specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
- Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
- Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
- Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
- Record environment details with the same snippet used in Phase D: `python - <<'PY' > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json\nimport torch, platform\nprint(f"Python: {platform.python_version()} ({platform.platform()})")\nprint(f"PyTorch: {torch.__version__}")\nprint(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")\nPY`.

**Evaluating code snippet formatting options**

I'm thinking about how to best present the Python snippet with newline characters—whether to keep it as a single quoted string with `\n` or convert it into a clearer multi-line code block. Since the instructions prefer commands and readable formatting, I’m leaning toward referencing the existing Phase D snippet and suggesting the user copy it, which simplifies the bullet point and avoids tricky escape sequences.

Summary: Capture CPU/GPU parity evidence for the vectorized tricubic path to unlock Phase E.

Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase E1 — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
- plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
- specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
- Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
- Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
- Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.

- Reviewed Ralph’s Phase D2 commit (f796861): vectorized polin* helpers landed with correct docstrings/tests; noted residual 4-iteration Python loops in polin2/polin3_vectorized—acceptable for now but flag for Phase E perf review.
- Updated `plans/active/vectorization.md` (D2 marked [D], D4 guidance clarified) and refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to focus on D4 evidence + Phase E staging.
- Issued new Perf-mode `input.md` directing Ralph to capture Phase D4 CPU/CUDA pytest logs, update polynomial_validation.md with timings, and log a new Attempt when done.
- Expect Ralph to run the specified selectors, archive logs under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`, and advance plan row D4 to [D] before moving into Phase E.

- Reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 progress: parity shim code/tests already landed (docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #120) but plan rows still open.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` C1–C3 to [D] with artifact references; marked `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` L3k.3c.4 as [D] and refreshed Next Actions to target Phase C4 evidence capture.
- Revised `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so L3k.3c.4 emphasises per-φ trace collection + targeted pytest logs before documentation work.
- Issued new `input.md` (Parity mode) directing Ralph to extend the trace harness with a `--phi-mode` toggle, record spec vs c-parity per-φ traces, rerun tests, and log artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/`.
- Expect Ralph to produce VG-1 parity evidence, update parity plan rows C4/C5, and then proceed toward Phase L3k.3d nb-compare once traces pass tolerances.

## 2025-10-08 (galph loop — L3k.3c.4 parity regression)
- Ran parity trace harness (spec & c-parity) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T011326Z/`; spec mode still diverges at φ₀ as expected, c-parity plateau remains Δk≈2.845e-05 > 1e-6.
- TRACE_C_PHI logging missing in current golden binary; reused older log to complete comparison. Logged this gap and marked plan row L3k.3c.4 as [P].
- Updated `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` + `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #122 with metrics and next steps (restore instrumentation, diagnose residual drift).
- Issued new Parity-mode input directing Ralph to tighten shim tolerances and regenerate traces with fresh C instrumentation.

**Planning input.md expansion**

I see the `input.md` is currently about 30 lines, but instructions want it around 100–200 lines, so I need to expand it carefully. I’ll add more bullet points in existing sections with detailed multi-line descriptions while keeping readability, focusing on `Priorities & Rationale`, `How-To Map`, `Pitfalls`, `Pointers`, and optionally `Next Up` to hit the target length without changing the section order.

   * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
 - First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.

 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.

 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
@@ -29,11 +54,18 @@
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.

 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.

 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.

 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.

-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.

  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
- No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
- Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
- Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.

 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:

+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.

+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.

+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.

   * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
 - First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.

   * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
 - First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e — Directory that will host the new CPU/GPU logs and metadata.
+  Keep the structure consistent (logs, env, hashes, README) to simplify later reviews.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.
+- Phase F1 design prep once Phase E closes, focusing on detector absorption batching strategy and doc references.
+  Start sketching tensor layouts so the follow-on loop can move immediately into implementation.

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e — Directory that will host the new CPU/GPU logs and metadata.
+  Keep the structure consistent (logs, env, hashes, README) to simplify later reviews.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.
+- Phase F1 design prep once Phase E closes, focusing on detector absorption batching strategy and doc references.
+  Start sketching tensor layouts so the follow-on loop can move immediately into implementation.

 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e — Directory that will host the new CPU/GPU logs and metadata.
+  Keep the structure consistent (logs, env, hashes, README) to simplify later reviews.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.
+- Phase F1 design prep once Phase E closes, focusing on detector absorption batching strategy and doc references.
+  Start sketching tensor layouts so the follow-on loop can move immediately into implementation.

   * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
 - First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.

+- Status Snapshot (2025-11-30): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Parity/perf validation (Phase E) is the active gate before detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
 - Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

**Summarizing final response details**

I'll organize the final message into clear sections with bullet points, covering adherence to instructions, documentation consulted, analysis of long-term goals, key findings about specs and outstanding tasks, file modifications with approximate line references, and next steps for Ralph. I'll also include the commit ID and note that no tests were run, ensuring the summary reflects thorough planning and evaluation as requested.
[2025-10-08T01:56:16] codex

**Loop Outcome**
- Refocused VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 on Phase E evidence: plans/active/vectorization.md:1 now states Phases A–D complete and spells out the new CPU/GPU log + perf deliverables.
- docs/fix_plan.md:2369 syncs with the plan—Next Actions target Phase E1–E3 plus Phase F1 design prep.
- input.md (101 lines) steers Ralph to capture Phase E1 logs, hashes, env snapshot, and leave Phase E notes; Mode flagged as Perf.
- galph_memory.md appended 2025-11-30 summary so future loops know Phase E kickoff context.

**Key Findings**
- Goal 1 (CLI flags): L3k.3c.4 still pending per plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md; parity evidence remains the blocker.
- Goal 2: specs/spec-a-core.md:200-220 confirms φ=0 carryover bug is not in the spec; docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 keeps it quarantined.
- Goal 3: Vectorization plan had stale D-phase wording; updated snapshot and exit criteria keep Ralph aligned with Phase E tasks.
- Long-term perf guardrails reaffirmed via docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md and docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17—both cited in the new memo.

**Next Steps for Ralph**
1. Run Phase E1 per input.md: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v`, capture CPU/CUDA logs under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`, add env + hashes, and note outcomes in polynomial_validation.md.
2. If GPU unavailable, document skips + `nvidia-smi` in phase_e/ before proceeding.

**Notes**
- No tests executed this loop.
- Commit: 221018e (SUPERVISOR: vectorization plan Phase E kickoff - tests: not run).

 If Blocked: Run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log, log the failure + hypothesis in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and stop.
 Priorities & Rationale:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 flags Phase E as the current gate after Phase D completion; logs now need to move under phase_e/.
+  Revisit this paragraph when logging the Attempt so the status snapshot remains accurate.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:1 updates the status snapshot to “Phases A–D complete; Phase E pending”, so E1 must land before microbenchmarks can proceed.
+  Without these artifacts the plan cannot progress to E2/E3 tasks.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:17 mandates device/dtype neutrality checks on CPU and CUDA before claiming success.
+  Use parameterised test outputs to show both devices are executing without unexpected skips.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:8 requires capturing GPU smoke evidence whenever tensor math paths change.
+  Cite the checklist explicitly in the Attempt to demonstrate compliance with runtime guardrails.
 - specs/spec-a-parallel.md:220 enforces tricubic acceptance tolerances (corr ≥ 0.9995) that the Phase E summary must cite.
+  Keep these thresholds handy when interpreting parity metrics later in Phase E3.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 already tracks Phase D metrics; Phase E evidence must append to that log for audit continuity.
+  Add a new subsection referencing `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` and `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log` once the runs complete.
+- arch.md:94 keeps vectorization an explicit ADR; running the acceptance tests now verifies the ADR remains true after the new batched helpers landed.
+  Mention ADR-11 in the Attempt summary to connect architecture intent with observed behaviour.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md:205 spells out the φ loop ordering that the tricubic path uses; confirming unchanged behaviour ensures we stay within spec after vectorization.
+  If failures appear, reread this spec section to confirm the rotation pipeline is still compliant.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/env.json preserves the baseline environment snapshot from Phase D.
+  Mirroring its format in Phase E ensures reviewers can diff environments quickly.
 How-To Map:
 - mkdir -p reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e and clear stale logs before starting.
+  Remove any prior scratch logs so the new evidence set is unambiguous.
 - Run the Do Now command first, piping output to tee to populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cpu.log.
+  Keep the raw terminal output as well in case additional parsing is needed later.
 - Re-run with CUDA by prefixing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTORCH_TEST_DEVICE=cuda` (or the project’s preferred override) and tee to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_cuda.log; note skipped tests if GPU unavailable.
+  Annotate the top of the log with a short comment explaining why skips occurred, if any.
 - Capture collection metadata via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/collect.log`.
-- Record environment details: `python scripts/collect_env.py > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json` (or replicate the Phase D env capture snippet).
+  This establishes the selector list for the Attempt record without executing the tests again.
+- Record environment details by reusing the Phase D inline snippet (`python - <<'PY' ... PY`) and redirecting it to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/env.json so the format stays consistent.
+  Ensure the snippet prints Python, PyTorch, CUDA availability, and commit SHA if convenient.
 - After runs, annotate timings/tensors in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md for continuity, noting new Phase E evidence paths.
+  Append references near the top of the Phase E section so reviewers see them immediately.
+- Append brief command provenance into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/README.md (create if absent) so later reviewers can replay E1 without hunting through logs.
+  Include both CPU and CUDA command variants verbatim in that README.
+- Diff the new `pytest_cpu.log` against Phase D equivalents to highlight any warning text changes before filing the Attempt entry.
+  Capture the diff output (or note "no diff") in the Attempt narrative to document diligence.
+- If CUDA skips occur, capture `nvidia-smi` output into reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/nvidia_smi.txt to document availability status.
+  Mention this file in the Attempt entry when explaining any skipped tests.
+- Once logs exist, sha256sum all artifacts in phase_e/ and stash the hash listing alongside the env file for reproducibility.
+  Follow the Phase D naming convention (`sha256.txt`) so tooling recognises it automatically.
+- After recording hashes, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt draft with placeholder bullet points so nothing is forgotten when the Run completes.
+  This keeps the log while context is still fresh.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not regress vectorization by toggling nearest-neighbour fallbacks; keep batched helpers active.
+  Any reinstated fallback will reintroduce the warnings that Phase D removed.
 - No `.to()`/`.cpu()` calls inside hot loops—maintain device/dtype neutrality per runtime checklist.
+  Introduce conversions outside the compiled region if temporary coercion is needed.
 - Avoid overwriting Phase D artifacts; store new logs exclusively under phase_e/.
+  If reruns are required, version the filenames with timestamps instead of clobbering evidence.
 - Keep CUDA run even if tests skip; document skips explicitly in the log and fix_plan Attempt notes.
+  Skipping documentation is treated as lack of evidence, so capture the reason in writing.
 - Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every pytest/benchmark invocation.
+  Missing the variable can crash mid-run, wasting time and producing partial logs.
 - Don’t loosen tricubic tolerances; if assertions fail, investigate rather than patching tests.
+  Loosened tolerances hide regressions and contradict the spec baseline set in Phase D.
 - Maintain clean working tree; no ad-hoc script copies outside scripts/ or reports/.
+  Temporary scripts should live inside reports/phase_e if they must exist at all.
 - Follow CLAUDE Rule #11 if additional instrumentation is required—quote nanoBragg.c before coding.
+  This protects future parity debugging from drifting away from the C reference.
 - Refrain from running full pytest suite; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md.
+  Save time and keep logs focused on the selectors tied to this plan item.
+- Do not modify `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` expectations; the goal is evidence gathering, not behaviour change this loop.
+  Any behavioural edits would need separate supervisor approval and likely delay Phase E progress.
+- Resist the urge to start Phase E2 benchmarks before attaching E1 logs, otherwise the performance data lacks a validated baseline.
+  The plan makes Phase E2 contingent on E1 artifacts—respect that gating.
+- Capture gradcheck failures verbatim if they surface; rerunning without fixing root causes hides real regressions.
+  Include failing stack traces in reports/phase_e/debug.log if encountered.
 Pointers:
 - docs/fix_plan.md:2369 — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 entry with refreshed Next Actions.
+  Reference this section when logging progress so the plan ledger stays synchronised.
 - plans/active/vectorization.md:48 — Phase E task table detailing E1–E3 deliverables.
+  Double-check the exit criteria there before marking any row as done.
 - reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md:1 — Prior evidence context; append Phase E notes here after runs.
+  Add a "Phase E1" subsection with bullet links to each new artifact.
 - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in Attempt summary.
+  Mention the checklist item numbers to prove compliance.
 - specs/spec-a-core.md:200 — Normative tricubic/phi loop context underpinning the acceptance thresholds.
+  Useful if parity metrics look off; reconfirm the rotation pipeline from the spec.
+- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:70 — Broadcast strategy reminders when interpreting parity logs.
+  The tensor-shape diagrams help decode per-batch logging output.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_d4_cpu.log:1 — Reference log for expected pass output format.
+  Use it as a baseline to spot warning text regressions.
+- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:32 — Guidance on logging targeted pytest selectors in Attempt entries.
+  Align the Attempt narrative with these requirements for future audits.
+- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e — Directory that will host the new CPU/GPU logs and metadata.
+  Keep the structure consistent (logs, env, hashes, README) to simplify later reviews.
 Next Up:
 - Phase E2 microbenchmark sweep with scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py once E1 logs are committed.
+  Capture both CPU and CUDA runs, then compare against Phase A metrics before logging Attempt.
+- Phase E3 parity/perf summary consolidation (nb-compare optional) before moving into Phase F planning.
+  Draft summary.md alongside fix_plan updates so the documentation trail stays tight.
+- Phase F1 design prep once Phase E closes, focusing on detector absorption batching strategy and doc references.
+  Start sketching tensor layouts so the follow-on loop can move immediately into implementation.

Capture CPU/CUDA logs under `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log` & `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log`. Ensure `pytest --collect-only` evidence stored (`phase_e/collect.log`). |
-| E2 | Run microbenchmarks post-vectorization | [ ] | Execute `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` with `--outdir reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/perf` (before/after metrics). Summarise deltas in `phase_e/perf_summary.md` and update `benchmark_results.json`. |
-| E3 | Document parity/perf summary | [ ] | Produce `phase_e/summary.md` noting corr/Δ metrics vs scalar path, reference nb-compare outputs if used, and record gradient/device neutrality confirmation. Update docs/fix_plan attempt with metrics + artifact links. |
+| E1 | Verify acceptance & regression tests | [ ] | Re-run `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` (full class) and `tests/test_at_str_002.py` on CPU+CUDA; include gradcheck markers if present. Capture logs to `phase_e/pytest_cpu.log`, `phase_e/pytest_cuda.log`, and `phase_e/collect.log` (collect-only proof). Note torch/cuda versions in `phase_e/env.json`. |
+| E2 | Run microbenchmarks post-vectorization | [ ] | Execute `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --device {cpu,cuda} --repeats 200 --outdir reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/perf` to compare against Phase A baselines. Summarise warm/cold timings and speedups in `phase_e/perf_summary.md`, updating `phase_e/perf_results.json`. |
+| E3 | Document parity/perf summary | [ ] | Produce `phase_e/summary.md` capturing correlation metrics (target corr≥0.9995 vs scalar baseline), highlight any tolerance deltas, and record gradient/device neutrality confirmation. Reference nb-compare artifacts if generated. Update docs/fix_plan Next Actions with the new evidence paths. |
 
 ### Phase F — Detector Absorption Vectorization
 Goal: Batch detector absorption loops over `detector_thicksteps` and oversample dimensions, reusing the tricubic vectorization patterns while keeping physics parity.
