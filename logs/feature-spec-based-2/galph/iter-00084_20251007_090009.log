review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

This shard contains the normative physics, geometry, sampling, and data handling requirements. CLI flag semantics live in [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md); cross-implementation profiles and developer tooling are captured in [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md).

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan: Detector Geometry Correlation Issue

**Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Issue**: PyTorch vs C reference correlation = 0.040 (target > 0.999)  
**Status**: Critical - Blocking validation of detector geometry implementation  

## Executive Summary

Despite fixing C reference parameter bugs (-twotheta, -Xbeam/-Ybeam), the correlation between PyTorch and C implementations remains unacceptably low (0.040). The detector geometry appears correct (basis vectors match), suggesting the issue lies deeper in the simulation pipeline.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Know Works
- ✅ Baseline configuration (no tilt): 0.999 correlation
- ✅ Detector basis vectors: Identical between C and PyTorch
- ✅ pix0_vector calculation: Matches between implementations
- ✅ C parameter mapping: Fixed (-twotheta, -Xbeam/-Ybeam)

### What Fails
- ❌ Tilted configuration (twotheta=20°): 0.040 correlation

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-18 parity refresh):
  1. Phase L3d implementation — Patch `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1073` to transfer HKL tensors with `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)`, attach metadata alongside data, and add targeted regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` for the supervisor reflection on CPU/CUDA.
  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.
  3. Phase L3f documentation sync — Update `analysis.md`, `docs/fix_plan.md` attempts, and architectural docs with the finalized ingestion/normalization flow once scaling validation passes.
  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-13] Attempt #71 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b validation + Phase L2c complete). **Harness already functional from Attempt #69; executed comparison script to identify first divergence.**
    Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Comparison identifies `I_before_scaling` as first divergent factor (C=943654.809, PyTorch=0, -100% delta).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:1-41` - Refreshed trace with live values (polar=0.91464138, omega_pixel=4.20404859e-07 sr, F_cell=0, I_before_scaling=0)

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-18): Phase A1–A3 evidence captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (pytest logs plus tricubic/absorption baselines). **Phase B design memo landed in Attempt #3 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) covering tensor shapes, polynomial mapping, and gradient/device checklists.** Next blocker is executing Phase C implementation tasks using that design as the contract.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-18 → refreshed 2025-11-18b): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now pivots to Phase C execution (tasks C1–C3). Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported, reuse the design memo’s Section 2/3 diagrams, and stage changes behind feature-flag-friendly commits to ease review if batching becomes necessary.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-06 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`, `.collect.log`, `test_at_abs_001.log`, `env.json`). Re-run only if dependencies change or new warnings appear. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

10:- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
11:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
12:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
13:- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
15:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
18:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
19:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
20:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
21:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
22:- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
23:- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
193:Exit Criteria: Code changes merged with targeted tests covering the corrected scaling, and docs/fix_plan.md records Attempt #29 metrics before moving to Phase L.
228:### Phase L — Supervisor Command Normalization
238:| L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [D] | ✅ Attempt #54 (2025-10-17): Regenerated C cache using supervisor command flags, achieved perfect HKL parity (max |ΔF|=0.0, 0 mismatches). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/{Fdump_c_20251109.bin, summary_20251109.md, metrics_20251109.json}`. Phase L2 prerequisites now met—structure factors match C exactly. |

Created `scripts/trace_per_phi.py`, generated PyTorch trace (`per_phi_pytorch_20251006-151228.json`), added TRACE_C_PHI to nanoBragg.c:3156-3160, ran C trace, compared via `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py`. **Finding:** Δk≈6.042 at φ=0° (C k_frac=−3.857, Py k_frac=−9.899), persists across all φ steps. **Root cause:** Not a φ-sampling issue—base lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before φ rotation. |
#### Phase K3f — Base lattice & scattering parity
Goal: Eliminate the Δk≈6.0 mismatch uncovered in K3e by proving base lattice vectors, pixel geometry, and scattering-vector math match C before φ rotation.
Prereqs: K3e per-φ evidence archived; MOSFLM rescale guard (K3a) merged; pix0 SAMPLE pivot parity validated (H6g).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison shows |Δh|, |Δk|, |Δl| < 5e-4 at φ=0° with matching lattice vectors and scattering vectors; scaling_chain.md refreshed with post-fix numbers; docs/fix_plan Attempt #46 logged.

| K3f2 | Extend PyTorch trace harness with matching fields | [D] | ✅ `trace_harness.py` now emits `TRACE_PY_BASE` using the corrected pixel vector path; output stored in `base_lattice/trace_py.log` (float64, CPU). |
| K3f3 | Diff base traces & isolate first divergence | [D] | ✅ `base_lattice/summary.md` compares logs and flags the first divergence at `a_star`/real vectors with ~40.5× magnitude gap, confirming Δh≈6.0 stems from unit-scale drift. |
| K3f4 | Record root cause & fix outline | [D] | 2025-11-08 update appended to `base_lattice/summary.md` documenting the placeholder-volume root cause and the 46ba36b fix; evidence lives under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/`. Coordinate docs/fix_plan Next Actions so K3g3 focuses on scaling parity. |

#### Phase K3g — MOSFLM real-vector rescale implementation
Goal: Mirror nanoBragg.c’s MOSFLM branch so PyTorch recomputes real lattice vectors, volumes, and reciprocal duals from the supplied A* matrix before φ/mosaic rotations.
Prereqs: K3f4 root-cause doc committed; guard tasks K3a/K3b still green.

**Analyzing plan completeness and sedation limits**

I'm checking if the plan file got truncated because of sedation limits; it looks like tasks beyond line 200 might be cut off and that could hide some Phase L3 details. I want to confirm whether the plan includes all recent tasks and if the current plan stays consistent with fix_plan and new instructions, so I’m thinking about extracting specific line ranges to verify the full plan coverage.

| L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [D] | ✅ Attempt #54 (2025-10-17): Regenerated C cache using supervisor command flags, achieved perfect HKL parity (max |ΔF|=0.0, 0 mismatches).

### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

   470	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1-54` - Phase L2c comparison report showing first divergence and all divergent factors
   471	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json` - Updated environment snapshot (git_sha current, torch version, device/dtype)
   472	    Observations/Hypotheses:
   473	      - **Harness functional:** Attempt #70 audit was stale; Attempt #69 already resolved the `(F_grid, metadata)` API change
   474	      - **First divergence confirmed:** `I_before_scaling=0` in PyTorch vs `943654.809` in C stems from the targeted pixel (685,1039) mapping to hkl≈(−7,−1,−14), where PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` but C’s trace records `F_cell=190.27`.
   475	      - **Root cause hypothesis (updated 2025-11-15):** Harness instrumentation is now correct; the discrepancy arises from structure-factor ingestion (HKL grid vs generated Fdump) rather than MOSFLM vector wiring.
   476	      - **Scaling infrastructure correct:** r_e², fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polar, omega_pixel all match C within tolerances (<0.002% delta)
   477	      - **Test coverage maintained:** tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics passes all parametrized variants
   478	    Next Actions: Phase L3 — Follow plan tasks L3a/L3b to trace how the supervisor pixel acquires `F_cell=190.27` in C (HKL vs Fdump), then proceed with the normalization/refactor steps once the ingestion gap is understood.
   479	  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #75 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUPERSEDED** (Phase L3a probe created but findings incorrect). **Probe script created but incorrectly concluded target reflection was absent from scaled.hkl; Attempt #76 corrected this.**
   480	    Metrics: Evidence-only loop; no production code changed. Pytest collection stable (50+ tests collected).
   481	    Artifacts:
   482	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.py` - Standalone probe script with HKL/Fdump grid interrogation
   483	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.log` - SUPERSEDED by Attempt #76
   484	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis.md` - SUPERSEDED by Attempt #76
   485	    Observations/Hypotheses:
   486	      - **INCORRECT FINDING:** scaled.hkl wrongly characterized as 13-byte stub; actually contains full 168k grid
   487	      - Probe script created successfully but not executed with correct parameters
   488	    Next Actions: Rerun probe with Fdump files to verify coverage (completed in Attempt #76).

   520	    Observations/Hypotheses:
   521	      - **CLI parsing works:** `parse_and_validate_args` correctly extracts HKL grid and metadata from scaled.hkl
   522	      - **Dtype/device as expected:** float32 CPU default per DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (no silent coercion)
   523	      - **Grid coverage matches probe:** CLI audit shows identical grid shape/ranges as Phase L3b probe (49×57×62, h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30])
   524	      - **Root cause is downstream:** The F_cell=0 discrepancy is NOT in CLI parsing (which works correctly), but rather in: (1) Harness attachment pattern, (2) Crystal initialization with HKL data, or (3) Structure factor lookup logic
   525	    Next Actions: Phase L3c continuation — Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL→Crystal flow, review harness attachment pattern comparison, add debug probe to `Crystal.get_structure_factor`, write minimal structure factor query test to isolate the handoff issue.
   526	  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #72 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b harness MOSFLM orientation fix). **Corrected `trace_harness.py` to assign each MOSFLM reciprocal vector to its own config field instead of packing all three into `mosflm_a_star`.**
   527	    Metrics: Harness now produces non-zero F_latt values (F_latt=1.351 vs previous 0), confirming proper orientation. Test suite passes 4/4 variants (tests/test_trace_pixel.py). Comparison script completed successfully (2 divergent factors identified).
   528	    Artifacts:
   529	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:159-161` - Fixed MOSFLM vector assignment (mosflm_a_star, mosflm_b_star, mosflm_c_star as separate tensors)
   530	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1-76` - Updated L2c comparison report confirming first divergence at I_before_scaling
   531	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` - Regenerated trace showing live polarization and omega values
   532	    Observations/Hypotheses:
   533	      - **Fix confirmed:** Switching from `mosflm_a_star=[a*, b*, c*]` (list) to individual tensor assignments (mosflm_a_star=tensor(a*), mosflm_b_star=tensor(b*), mosflm_c_star=tensor(c*)) enables Crystal.compute_cell_tensors to use the MOSFLM orientation properly
   534	      - **F_latt now non-zero:** Lattice shape factors are computed correctly (F_latt_a=-2.405, F_latt_b=-0.861, F_latt_c=0.652, product=1.351)
   535	      - **F_cell still zero:** This is expected—pixel (685,1039) computes h=-7,k=-1,l=-14 but scaled.hkl only contains (1,12,3), so structure factor lookup correctly returns 0
   536	      - **Scaling factors verified:** All intermediate scaling terms (r_e², fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polar, omega_pixel) match C within tolerance (Δ<0.002%)
   537	      - **Test coverage maintained:** tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics passes all parametrized variants (4/4)
   538	    Next Actions: Phase L2b complete; L2c evidence captured. Supervisor to proceed with Phase L3 structure-factor investigation based on comparison summary showing I_before_scaling as first divergence.
   539	  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #79 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L3c device audit COMPLETE per supervisor "Do Now"). **Evidence-only loop; confirmed device handling gap: HKL tensor remains on CPU despite `-device cuda` flag.**

   621	    Observations/Hypotheses:

   623	      - Until live TRACE_PY values are captured again, Phase L2c cannot identify the first divergent scaling factor.

   625	  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #68 (ralph loop) — Result: **PARTIAL SUCCESS** (Phase L2c comparison tooling complete). **Created `compare_scaling_traces.py` script and executed initial comparison; identified that old PyTorch trace has stale placeholder values.**

   629	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_comparison_initial.md` - Initial comparison results showing first divergence is I_before_scaling (MISSING due to placeholder)
   630	      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/capture_live_trace.py` - Attempted helper script (did not capture TRACE_PY as pytest captures stdout by default)
   631	    Observations/Hypotheses:
   632	      - **Simulator instrumentation is working:** Attempt #67 proves TRACE_PY outputs real values; tests pass 4/4 variants
   633	      - **Trace harness is outdated:** Lines 252-286 of `trace_harness.py` manually construct TRACE_PY lines with hardcoded placeholders ("NOT_EXTRACTED", polar=beam_config.polarization_factor, capture_fraction=1.0) instead of invoking simulator.run() with debug_config and capturing stdout
   634	      - **Easy fix available:** Modify harness to create Simulator with `debug_config={'trace_pixel': [685, 1039]}`, capture stdout during run(), and write TRACE_PY lines to output file
   635	      - **Comparison script validates expectations:** Correctly parses both traces, computes deltas, identifies first divergence, and generates markdown summary with thresholds (MATCH < 0.001%, MINOR < 1%, DIVERGENT < 10%, CRITICAL ≥10%)
   636	    Next Actions: Next engineer turn should update trace_harness.py to use the live simulator TRACE_PY output (invoke with debug_config, capture stdout, write to file), rerun harness to generate fresh trace_py_scaling.log, then rerun comparison script to identify the actual first divergence with real PyTorch values.
   637	  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #67 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b instrumentation complete). **TRACE_PY now emits real I_before_scaling, polarization, capture_fraction values from simulator internals.**

**Reassessing project focus and plan status**

I’m verifying that the L3d phase is complete since the tests and code changes for CLI flags are present, though the plan hasn’t been updated to reflect that. It seems best to shift focus to the next phase L3e involving scaling validation, so I’ll review the relevant validation script to prepare for that step and propose updating the plan to keep everything aligned.

- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

**Updating documentation plan steps**

I'm focusing on revising the Next Actions section in `docs/fix_plan.md` to remove the completed L3d step and promote L3e as the new first action. I'll reorder the enumerated list accordingly and clarify the tasks for L3e, L3f, and L4, making sure the plan matches the current project status.

TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

**Organizing L3e evidence and instructions**

I'm gathering details to update the scaling validation script and form instructions to guide engineers on running it and verifying results. This includes referencing specific logs as baselines, outlining targeted tests like `test_hkl_tensor_respects_device`, specifying report paths, and drafting a clear, stepwise plan for the `input.md` document to confirm CLI scaling parity. I'll also highlight fallback steps and provide precise commands for trace comparison and metrics generation.

   441	- First Divergence (if known): `parse_and_validate_args` (src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:435) calls `read_hkl_file`/`try_load_hkl_or_fdump` without forwarding the parsed dtype, so HKL/Fdump data is always loaded as float32. When the CLI is run with `-dtype float64`, the simulator converts those float32 tensors to float64 later, permanently losing precision relative to the requested double-precision path and violating the DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 guarantee.
   442	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   443	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   444	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   445	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   446	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   447	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   448	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

   241	### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
   242	Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
   243	Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
   244	Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

   254	Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
   255	Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

Summary: Tighten supervisor-command scaling parity by extending the scaling trace comparison to enforce sub-micro tolerances.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3e — scaling validation script update
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests:
- pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py
- pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv
Artifacts:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/metrics.json
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/run_metadata.json
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3e — extend compare_scaling_traces to emit ≤1e-6 parity metrics and run "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`
If Blocked: If traces look stale or missing factors, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` and recapture the JSON/env snapshots before repeating the comparison.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
How-To Map:
- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
- Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
- Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
- Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
- Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
- Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
 - Next Actions (2025-11-18 parity refresh):
-  1. Phase L3d implementation — Patch `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1073` to transfer HKL tensors with `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)`, attach metadata alongside data, and add targeted regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` for the supervisor reflection on CPU/CUDA.
-  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.
-  3. Phase L3f documentation sync — Update `analysis.md`, `docs/fix_plan.md` attempts, and architectural docs with the finalized ingestion/normalization flow once scaling validation passes.
-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

-  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.

-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
 - Next Actions (2025-11-18 parity refresh):
-  1. Phase L3d implementation — Patch `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1073` to transfer HKL tensors with `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)`, attach metadata alongside data, and add targeted regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` for the supervisor reflection on CPU/CUDA.
-  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.
-  3. Phase L3f documentation sync — Update `analysis.md`, `docs/fix_plan.md` attempts, and architectural docs with the finalized ingestion/normalization flow once scaling validation passes.
-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.

-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.

 Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3e — extend compare_scaling_traces to emit ≤1e-6 parity metrics and run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`
 If Blocked: If traces look stale or missing factors, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` and recapture the JSON/env snapshots before repeating the comparison.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json — Latest env snapshot to mirror in run_metadata.json.
 Next Up: If scaling validation closes cleanly, proceed to Phase L3f documentation sync before scheduling the nb-compare rerun (L4).

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

-  2.

-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.

+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

-  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.
-  3. Phase L3f documentation sync — Update `analysis.md`, `docs/fix_plan.md` attempts, and architectural docs with the finalized ingestion/normalization flow once scaling validation passes.
-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3e — extend compare_scaling_traces to emit ≤1e-6 parity metrics and run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`
 If Blocked: If traces look stale or missing factors, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` and recapture the JSON/env snapshots before repeating the comparison.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
 - Next Actions (2025-11-18 parity refresh):
-  1. Phase L3d implementation — Patch `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1073` to transfer HKL tensors with `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)`, attach metadata alongside data, and add targeted regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` for the supervisor reflection on CPU/CUDA.
-  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.
-  3. Phase L3f documentation sync — Update `analysis.md`, `docs/fix_plan.md` attempts, and architectural docs with the finalized ingestion/normalization flow once scaling validation passes.
-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

 Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3e — extend compare_scaling_traces to emit ≤1e-6 parity metrics and run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`
 If Blocked: If traces look stale or missing factors, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` and recapture the JSON/env snapshots before repeating the comparison.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**

Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

**Summarizing final updates and references**

I'll organize the final message with concise bullet points referencing key file paths and line numbers such as `docs/fix_plan.md:460-463`, `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:259-264`, `input.md:1-66`, and `galph_memory.md:1550-1554`. I'll highlight the completion of L3d tasks and the shift to L3e focus, note that no tests were run, and suggest clear next steps for Ralph based on the input instructions, keeping the message structured under headers like **Updates** and **Notes** as requested.
[2025-10-07T09:08:38] codex

**Updates**
- Retired the lingering L3d work item and re-pointed CLI-FLAGS-003 toward Phase L3e by editing Next Actions to emphasise the ≤1e-6 scaling audit deliverables (`docs/fix_plan.md:460-463`).
- Marked L3d complete in the active CLI plan and logged Attempt #81 as the regression proof, leaving L3e/L3f/L4 as the remaining open tasks (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:259-264`).
- Rewrote `input.md` with Parity-mode guidance that tells Ralph exactly how to enhance `compare_scaling_traces.py`, which artifacts to capture, and which pytest selectors to run (`input.md:1-80`).
- Captured today’s supervisory decisions—including the L3e focus shift and requested artifacts—in `galph_memory.md` for future loops (`galph_memory.md:1550-1554`).

**Notes**
- No tests were run in this supervisor loop.
- Next loop should produce `metrics.json`, `run_metadata.json`, and an updated scaling summary under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/`, then log the attempt in fix_plan once the ≤1e-6 tolerances are verified.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
 - Next Actions (2025-11-18 parity refresh):
-  1. Phase L3d implementation — Patch `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1073` to transfer HKL tensors with `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)`, attach metadata alongside data, and add targeted regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` for the supervisor reflection on CPU/CUDA.
-  2. Phase L3e scaling validation — Extend or author `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing JSON/markdown under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with ≤1e-6 deltas for ω, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, and I_before_scaling.
-  3. Phase L3f documentation sync — Update `analysis.md`, `docs/fix_plan.md` attempts, and architectural docs with the finalized ingestion/normalization flow once scaling validation passes.
-  4. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

 Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3e — extend compare_scaling_traces to emit ≤1e-6 parity metrics and run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`
 If Blocked: If traces look stale or missing factors, rerun `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` and recapture the JSON/env snapshots before repeating the comparison.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns.
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines the validation deliverables and artifact locations.
-- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must be upgraded to produce machine-checkable metrics and ≥1e-6 thresholds.
+- docs/fix_plan.md:450-463 — Next actions promote L3e as the gate before parity reruns and specify required artifacts.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:252-264 — Phase L3 table defines deliverables, tolerance, and the scaling_validation directory for outputs.
+- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-210 — Current script emits markdown only; must grow structured output and enforce the tighter tolerance band.
 - docs/development/testing_strategy.md:118-150 — Reinforces device/dtype neutrality expectations for parity diagnostics.
-- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-related flags; confirms expected inputs for the supervisor command.
+- specs/spec-a-cli.md:5-120 — CLI contract for scaling-sensitive flags; confirms the supervisor command’s parameter set.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md — Existing markdown baseline whose structure should inform the upgraded summary.
 How-To Map:
-- Ensure editable install active; export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every Python run involving torch.
-- After editing the comparison script, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to confirm discovery, then `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv`.
+- Ensure editable install active (`pip install -e .` if needed) and export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch-based command.
+- After script edits, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` to verify collection, then execute `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device -vv` to ensure regression remains green.
 - Generate parity metrics with `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md`.
-- Capture numeric deltas into `metrics.json` (≤1e-6 relative) and log runtime/env data into `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
-- Summarize findings + thresholds hit in the summary markdown and reference both files in docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- Extend the script so it also writes `metrics.json` (per-factor absolute/relative deltas) and `run_metadata.json` (env snapshot, command parameters) alongside the markdown.
+- Summarize thresholds met, flag any ≥1e-6 deltas, and reference both artifacts when updating docs/fix_plan Attempt notes.
+- If tolerances fail, annotate the markdown with failing factors and stop for supervisor review—do not patch simulator code in this loop.
+- Cross-check the JSON metrics against the markdown table to confirm consistency before marking the attempt complete.
+- Store command invocations (including environment variables) in run_metadata.json to aid reproducibility next loop.
+- After artifacts exist, stage them plus script changes, but defer commits until supervisor review of results.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
 - Do not modify simulator or production scaling code; this loop is evidence-only.
 - Preserve device/dtype neutrality when parsing tensors; no hidden `.cpu()`/`.item()` calls.
 - Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references, loop.sh, input.md).
 - Avoid rerunning full parity suites; stay within targeted traces and pytest selectors.
 - Ensure new artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` with timestamps.
+- Capture CUDA availability in run_metadata.json; note skips explicitly if GPU absent.
+- Do not overwrite prior scaling audit logs—write new files or timestamped copies.
+- Resist editing plan docs unless you discover new evidence gaps; supervisor will reconcile.
+- Maintain the existing trace log filenames so downstream scripts keep working; only add new outputs.
+- Do not relax tolerances below 1e-6 without supervisor approval; failing factors must be investigated instead.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
+- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
