this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that none of the C implementation bugs were propagated to the specs. Update the specs and pytorch implementation if needed.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-23 refresh → galph):
1. Phase L3k.3c.2 — Write up the measured parity gap: record Δk=1.8116×10⁻² and (once computed) Δb_y≈4.4×10⁻² Å in `diagnosis.md` and `fix_checklist.md`, reference `c_trace_phi_20251123.log`, and spell out the carryover emulation plan (cache φ_{last} state to reuse when φ_tic=0).
2. Phase L3k.3c.3 — Implement the φ=0 carryover fix in `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors`, rerun the per-φ harness, and confirm VG-1 metrics fall below 1e-6 (Δk and Δb_y) before updating `comparison_summary.md` / VG-1 checklist entries to ✅.
3. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-21] Attempt #95 (galph supervisor loop) — Result: **PLANNING UPDATE** (Phase L3k added). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Planning-only (no tests executed).
    Artifacts:
      - `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` — New Phase L3k section outlining implementation gates.
      - `docs/fix_plan.md` — Next Actions retargeted to Phase L3k; checklist referenced.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-23 PM): Attempt #109 regenerated the TRACE_C_PHI log under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/` and re-ran `compare_per_phi_traces.py`; Δk now measures 1.8116e-2 at φ_tic=0 while φ≥1 stay within 2.85e-5, confirming the carryover mismatch and leaving VG-1 blocked until the remediation lands.
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.

### C-IMPL-BUG-002 — Incorrect Angle Units in `mosaic_rotation_umat` (High)
**Summary:** The random misset path feeds `90.0` (degrees) into `mosaic_rotation_umat`, but the helper interprets angles in radians. The code therefore constructs rotation matrices using a 90-radian cap (≈5156°), which produces non-physical orientations.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). Reusable tricubic and absorption harnesses now live under `scripts/benchmarks/` (see Phase A artifacts) for ongoing baseline comparisons.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-23 refresh): Phase C1–C3 are COMPLETE with logs in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`; assertions and device checks landed in commit 12742e5. The next gating work is Phase D (vectorize `polint`/`polin2`/`polin3`) followed by Phase E validation before touching detector absorption (Phase F).
- Supervisory note (2025-11-23): Before coding Phase D, ensure the polynomial vectorization tasks record explicit tensor-shape math, gradient expectations, and targeted regression selectors in `phase_d/` notes. Capture proof (CPU+CUDA) for each helper as it is batched, then roll those artifacts into the Phase E parity/perf sweep prior to resuming absorption work.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

**Analyzing phi angle discrepancies and vector differences**

I'm digging into the subtle differences between pyro and C calculations for phi steps and scattering vectors, trying to understand why the discrepancies vary with phi index. There’s a complex interplay of rotation, scattering vector constants, and possible geometry mismatches causing these non-uniform differences across phi angles. I want to reproduce some of these dot products in Python for a clearer picture.

**Analyzing scattering vector discrepancies**

I’m comparing scattering vector values from logs and my computed dot products, trying to understand differences possibly caused by unit conversions between meters and Angstroms or digit misreads in the logs. I’m investigating how vectors `a`, `b`, and `c` are converted around the phi loop to see if a scaling factor like `1e10` affects the comparison and final dot product results.

**Summarizing instrumentation bug and next steps**

I'm gathering key points about the instrumentation bug in the Simulator causing phi step size mismatch and its impact on per-phi trace comparisons. I plan to include this in the evidence summary and update input.md with clear instructions referencing fix_plan items, ensuring the user knows to fix both the carryover and instrumentation issues. I'll also verify the current git branch to confirm where to apply these updates.

**Outlining input.md content and references**

I'll organize the structure and key content for input.md, detailing how to reference various logs and artifacts without line numbers, specifying paths for new timestamped reports, and including clear instructions on implementing fixes, running tests, and verifying results. I'll also map out priorities with relevant file references and commands to support the process.

   260	Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
   261	Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
   262	Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

Keep the log + timestamped copies alongside a brief summary in `analysis.md`, then proceed to L3c to thread the same attachment pattern through the harness/CLI path. |
   267	| L3b | Mirror probe attachment in harness | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-17 Attempt #78: `trace_harness.py` now assigns both `hkl_data` and `hkl_metadata` before simulator construction (see `trace_py_scaling_20251117.log`, `harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt`). Keeps harness behavior aligned with probe results and removes F_cell=0 divergence. |
   268	| L3c | Audit CLI HKL loading path | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-18 Attempt #80: Refreshed `cli_hkl_audit.md` with precise line refs (line 1073) showing dtype-only transfer; confirmed probe artifacts and logged device gap blocking CUDA parity. |
   269	| L3d | Add targeted regression tests | [D] | ✅ Attempt #81 (2025-11-18): Added `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` covering CPU/CUDA × float32/float64; ensures HKL tensors honor requested device/dtype and lookups return F≈190.27 for (-7,-1,-14). |
   270	| L3e | Refresh per-phi scaling validation | [D] | ✅ Attempt #86 (2025-10-07 timestamp, replayed 2025-11-19 artifacts): Harness now captures 10 `TRACE_PY_PHI` lines plus JSON, reruns `compare_scaling_traces.py`, and stores outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/{per_phi,scaling_validation}/`. Remaining delta isolated to `k_frac`/`F_latt_b` at phi=0. |
   271	| L3f | Rotation-vector audit (new) | [D] | ✅ Attempts #86/#88 (2025-11-18/19) produced `rot_vector_comparison.md`, `invariant_probe.md`, and per-φ JSON showing φ=0 real vectors drifting in Y while reciprocal vectors remain aligned ≤1e-9. Evidence archived under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/`. |
   272	| L3g | Fractional Miller alignment plan | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-07 Attempt #91: Instrumented simulator.py:1313-1322 to emit `spindle_axis_raw/normalized/magnitude`, reran φ=0 trace (43 TRACE_PY lines), confirmed Δ(magnitude)=0.0 (tolerance ≤5e-4). H1 **RULED OUT**: spindle is exact unit vector [-1,0,0], normalization is no-op. H3 (MOSFLM matrix semantics) promoted to primary suspect. Artifacts: `rot_vector/spindle_audit.log`, `analysis.md` (updated with H3 ranking). |
   273	| L3h | MOSFLM matrix probe & diff | [D] | ✅ Attempt #92 (2025-10-07, ralph evidence loop i=92): Created `trace_harness.py` in rot_vector/, captured 12 MOSFLM probe lines (post-misset reciprocals, reconstructed reals, re-derived reciprocals), proved V_formula ≈ V_actual (Δ=1.5e-11 Å³), **ruled out Hypothesis H2**. Reciprocal re-derivation exact to 15 digits. Artifacts: `mosflm_matrix_probe.md` (primary doc), `mosflm_matrix_probe_output.log`, `trace_harness.py`, `harness_run.log`. pytest: 579 tests collected. Next: Phase L3i C instrumentation to complete C vs PyTorch diff. |
   274	| L3i | C instrumentation & diff | [D] | ✅ Attempt #93 (2025-10-07, ralph loop i=93): Captured full C MOSFLM pipeline trace (291 lines) via instrumented `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2050-2199`, executed supervisor command, performed component-level diff. **H3 (MOSFLM transpose) RULED OUT** — real-space b_Y matches to O(1e-7) Å. Artifacts: `c_trace_mosflm.log`, `c_trace_extract.txt`, `mosflm_matrix_diff.md`, `analysis.md` (updated with H5-H7 hypotheses). pytest: 652 tests collected. Next: L3j fix checklist focusing on H5 (phi rotation) verification. |
   275	| L3j.1 | Refresh correction memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-07 Attempt #94 (ralph, documentation loop): Extended `mosflm_matrix_correction.md` with "Post-L3i Findings" section citing H3 ruling (b_Y matches C at φ=0 to 1.35e-07 Å), promoted H5 (φ rotation application) as primary suspect, documented quantitative deltas (b_Y +6.8%, k_frac Δ≈0.018, I_ratio 0.755), and spelled out φ samples (0°, 0.05°, 0.1°) with supervisor command context. Artifact: `mosflm_matrix_correction.md` lines 57-208. |
   276	| L3j.2 | Author fix checklist | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-07 Attempt #94: Created `fix_checklist.md` with 5 verification gates (VG-1: per-φ harness rerun; VG-2: pytest lattice tests; VG-3: nb-compare ROI parity; VG-4: component-level delta audit; VG-5: documentation updates). Includes thresholds (b_Y ≤1e-6 relative, correlation ≥0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01), detailed command templates, spec/doc references, and implementation notes. Artifact: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md` (5 gates, 19 rows). |
   277	| L3j.3 | Sync plan + fix_plan | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #96: Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 with Attempt #96 entry documenting Phase L3k.1 completion (implementation memo), artifact paths, root cause analysis, proposed fix strategy, and next actions for code implementation loop. Documented Mode: Docs constraint (no code changes this loop). Updated this plan to mark L3k.1 complete. pytest --collect-only deferred to implementation loop. |

7:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
21:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-22): Attempt #101 (L3k.3b evidence loop) regenerated per-φ PyTorch traces and confirmed k_frac span=1.8088e-2. No matching `TRACE_C_PHI` lines exist in the current C trace, so the comparison tooling falsely reports "parity achieved." Phase L3k now requires explicit instrumentation of the golden C binary plus a guard that treats missing C data as a blocking failure before nb-compare/ROI work resumes.
35:- Gap snapshot recap (2025-11-22): L3k.2 landed (Attempt #97) with reciprocal recompute + docstring, VG-2 passed (Attempt #98), but VG-1/VG-3 failed (Attempt #99) — k_frac span 1.8×10⁻², correlation 0.985, sum_ratio 1.16×10⁵ because the C ROI sum came back ≈0. Attempt #100 realigned the φ=0 tests to the supervisor spindle axis so the drift is now captured in red tests. Focus next: diagnose the residual φ rotation error, fix the nb-compare ROI anomaly, then rerun VG-1⇢VG-4 before logging L3k.4.
277:| L3j.3 | Sync plan + fix_plan | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #96: Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 with Attempt #96 entry documenting Phase L3k.1 completion (implementation memo), artifact paths, root cause analysis, proposed fix strategy, and next actions for code implementation loop. Documented Mode: Docs constraint (no code changes this loop). Updated this plan to mark L3k.1 complete. pytest --collect-only deferred to implementation loop. |
279:### Phase L3k — φ Rotation Fix Implementation
286:| L3k.1 | Author implementation memo + docstring reference | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #96 (ralph Mode: Docs): Appended Phase L3k Implementation Memo to `mosflm_matrix_correction.md:187-297` documenting root cause (independent rotation of real+reciprocal vectors), C reference (nanoBragg.c:3044-3066), proposed fix (rotate only real, recompute reciprocal from cross products), implementation strategy (preserve vectorization/device neutrality), and verification thresholds (VG-1⇢VG-5). C-code docstring reference requirement documented for L3k.2. Artifacts: implementation memo, updated fix_plan Attempt #96, updated this plan L3j.3→[D]. Mode: Docs → no code changes; docstring addition deferred to implementation loop. |
287:| L3k.2 | Implement φ rotation fix | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-21 Attempt #97 (ralph loop i=97): Fixed `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors` (crystal.py:1008-1035) to rotate ONLY real vectors, then recompute reciprocal via cross products and V_actual per CLAUDE Rule #13. Added C-code docstring reference (lines 1010-1013) per CLAUDE Rule #11. Preserved vectorization, device neutrality, gradient flow. Metrics: test_f_latt_square_matches_c PASSED (5.79s), 57 crystal/geometry tests PASSED, 653 tests collected. Artifacts: crystal.py:1008-1035 (fixed implementation), Attempt #97 in fix_plan.md. |
288:| L3k.3 | Execute verification gates VG-1⇢VG-5 | [P] | Attempt #98 cleared VG-2, Attempt #99 exposed the remaining gaps (k_frac span 1.8e-2, correlation 0.985, sum_ratio 1.16e5), and Attempt #108 captured φ=0 PyTorch state probes while flagging the C trace dependency. Re-open VG-1 workflow: re-run TRACE_C_PHI under the 20251123 timestamp (or update the harness to consume the 202510070839 asset), regenerate per-φ comparisons, then continue through the nb-compare ROI repair and documentation gates. Artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` (base_vector_debug/, per_phi_postfix/) and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/nb_compare_phi_fix/`. |
290:#### L3k.3 Checklist — φ=0 Verification Recovery
294:| L3k.3a | Align φ=0 harness/tests with supervisor spindle axis | [D] | ✅ Attempt #100 updated `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to set `spindle_axis=[-1,0,0]`, producing the expected red baseline (rot_b drift, k_frac delta). Keep these tests red until the physics fix lands; rerun `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py -k "phi0" -vv` after each patch. |
295:| L3k.3b | Restore C↔Py per-φ comparison pipeline | [D] | ✅ Attempt #109 (2025-11-23) rebuilt the instrumented C binary, captured `c_trace_phi_20251123.log`, reran `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py`, and populated `delta_metrics.json` (Δk=1.8116e-2 @ φ=0, Δk≤2.85e-5 elsewhere). Artifacts: `base_vector_debug/20251123/` trace set, updated comparison summary. |
296:| L3k.3c | Patch φ rotation & confirm VG-1 thresholds | [ ] | **Regression alert:** Attempt #102 rewrote `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to treat the PyTorch base-vector output as canonical, masking the failing VG-1 gate. Attempt #103 restored the C-aligned assertions; keep them red until VG-1 passes. With the C trace refreshed (L3k.3b), implement the carryover fix, rerun the per-φ harness, ensure k_frac span ≤1e-6 and rot_b_y relative error ≤1e-6, and update `comparison_summary.md` plus `per_phi_postfix/` artifacts before flipping VG-1 rows to ✅. |
297:| L3k.3d | Resolve nb-compare ROI parity (VG-3/VG-4) | [ ] | Investigate the C ROI zero-sum issue (ROI bounds, image loader, dtype). Once resolved, rerun `nb-compare --roi` to hit correlation ≥0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, and component deltas meeting VG-4 thresholds. Record metrics in `vg3_metrics.txt` and update `fix_checklist.md`. |
298:| L3k.3e | Finalize documentation + checklist (VG-5) | [ ] | When VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, mark remaining rows in `fix_checklist.md` ✅, append resolutions to `mosflm_matrix_correction.md`, and prep notes for the L3k.4 attempt log. |
299:| L3k.4 | Log Attempt + plan sync | [ ] | **BLOCKED on L3k.3 completion.** Append new Attempt entry in `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (correlation, sum_ratio, b_Y delta, k_frac delta from VG artifacts), reference all artifact paths (per-φ traces, pytest log, nb-compare summary, updated checklist), document observations (H5 confirmed, thresholds met), and flip L3k.1–L3k.4 rows to [D] in this plan. Update Next Actions to proceed to Phase L4 supervisor command parity rerun. |
301:#### L3k.3c Tasks — Restore φ=0 Parity with C Reference
305:| L3k.3c.1 | Reinstate C-aligned assertions | [D] | ✅ Attempt #103 (2025-10-07) restored the C expectations in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py`, leaving both φ=0 parity tests failing against the C reference. Artifact: `reports/.../pytest_phi0_regression.log`. Keep these assertions active so the fix cannot be masked. |
306:| L3k.3c.2 | Diagnose φ=0 state carryover | [P] | Attempt #109 now supplies both traces; log Δb_y (expect ≈4.4×10⁻² Å) and Δk_frac (=1.8116×10⁻²) in `diagnosis.md` + `fix_checklist.md`, cite nanoBragg.c:3044 guard, and outline the vectorized carryover emulation (store φ_{-1} state for φ_tic=0) before coding L3k.3c.3. |
307:| L3k.3c.3 | Implement + validate fix | [ ] | After agreeing on the fix approach, run the per-φ harness and targeted pytest selector (`tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c`). Store passing artifacts under a new timestamped directory in `base_vector_debug/` and update `fix_checklist.md` VG-1.4 to ✅ once thresholds are met. |

# φ Rotation Parity Fix Checklist (CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3j)

## Overview

This checklist enumerates verification gates for implementing the φ rotation parity fix. All gates must pass before marking CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3 complete.

**Primary Hypothesis:** H5 (φ Rotation Application) — Drift emerges during `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors()` when φ transitions from 0° → 0.05° → 0.1°.

**Evidence Base:** Phases L3a–L3i proved MOSFLM base vectors correct at φ=0 (b_Y agrees to O(1e-7) Å). Divergence must occur during phi rotation.

## Verification Gates

| VG-1.3 | φ=0.1° trace generation | Implementation Loop | ✅ | `per_phi_postfix/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json` entry 9 | Full oscillation φ=0.1°, k_frac=-0.607230 |
| VG-1.4 | Per-φ JSON stability | Implementation Loop | ⚠️ | `per_phi_postfix/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json`; **NEW: `base_vector_debug/20251123/`** | k_frac span=0.018088 (threshold <1e-6 NOT MET); 10 φ entries captured. **Attempt #103 (2025-10-07 Phase L3k.3c.2):** Evidence-only loop captured quantitative metrics. Per-φ comparison via `compare_latest.txt`: first divergence at φ_tic=0 with **Δk=1.811649e-02**; φ_tic=1-9 within tolerance (Δk<3e-5). Component-level measurement via `delta_by.txt`: **Δb_y=0.045731552549 Å** (units: Angstroms). Remediation plan: implement φ=0 carryover in `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors` to cache φ_last state. Artifacts: `compare_latest.txt`, `delta_by.txt`, `diagnosis.md` (full metrics table + remediation outline). VG-1.4 threshold NOT MET but root cause isolated and documented. Next: Phase L3k.3c.3 implementation. |
| **VG-2** | **Targeted Pytest (Lattice Factors)** | Implementation Loop | ✅ (Attempt #98, 2025-11-21) | `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/pytest_vg2.log` | Regression coverage for lattice vector parity; refresh log if missing |

**Updating next actions and attempts history**

I’m updating the Next Actions list to reflect that L3k.3c.2 is done and to swap out the old metric-writing task for a new item about the instrumentation bug. I’ll also revise the attempts history, especially around attempt #98 and later ones like #109, to note updated data availability and keep everything consistent. I need to check further down past line 520 for any related entries to make sure nothing is missed.

   532	      - PyTorch reuses the unrotated base vector at φ₀ (rot_b_y = 0.7173197865486145 Å), then matches C for φ≥1 (Δk ≤ 2.845×10⁻⁵)
   533	      - The remaining parity gap is therefore the φ=0 carryover: we must persist the φ_{last} rotated state (or equivalent) when φ_tic loops back to zero
   534	    First Divergence: φ_tic=0 (φ=0°) — Δk=1.8116×10⁻² (PyTorch -0.5891393528 vs C -0.6072558396), ΔF_latt_b=1.912228

 ### Phase L4 — Supervisor Command Parity Rerun
 Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end parity for the supervisor command (correlation ≥ 0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px) and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

**Preparing instructions for trace regeneration**

I’m gathering commands and steps the user will need to rebuild and instrument C traces after the fix, including setting environment variables and running supervisor commands, to clearly guide reproducing corrected traces and JSON outputs.

I'll carefully compose an input.md file covering summary, mode, focus, branches, mapped tests, artifacts, exact commands for reproduction, fallback steps, priorities with file references, how-to steps with commands and env vars, pitfalls to avoid, pointers to code lines, and potential next tasks—ensuring clarity and precise commands for the user to follow verifying the fix.

Summary: Land φ=0 carryover parity and fix per-φ instrumentation so CLI-FLAGS-003 can clear VG-1.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase L3k.3c.3 φ=0 carryover fix
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q ; pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c -v
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<new_timestamp>/ ; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<new_timestamp>/ ; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<new_timestamp>/comparison_summary.md

If Blocked: If the harness fails to emit TRACE_PY_PHI lines, rerun `pytest --collect-only -q`, capture the failure log under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/blockers/<date>/`, and note the blocker in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history before attempting any workaround.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:286 — L3k.3c.3 explicitly calls for φ carryover plus VG-1 evidence, so we must implement that change now.
- docs/fix_plan.md:450 — Next Actions already gate L3k.3d on the φ=0 fix; completing this unblocks the long-term CLI parity goal.
- src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1008 — Existing rotation loop is vectorised but lacks the φ_last reuse that nanoBragg.c applies.
- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:1444 — Per-φ instrumentation currently divides osc_range by (phi_steps-1), producing φ=0.011111° samples; correcting this keeps traces aligned with the C loop formula.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/delta_metrics.json — Shows Δk(φ₀)=1.8116e-02, our acceptance benchmark for the fix.
How-To Map:
- Set env: `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` and `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any torch import; keep `PYTHONPATH=src` when running harness scripts.
- Rebuild PyTorch trace after coding: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --dtype float64 --device cpu --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_rot_vector.log` (the harness will also emit the per-φ JSON under the matching per_phi/ path).
- Run comparison: `python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_rot_vector_per_phi.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/c_trace_phi_20251123.log | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/<new_timestamp>/compare_latest.txt`.
- Execute targeted pytest: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c -v` (expected to go green only after Δk, Δb_y < 1e-6).
- After pytest, rerun `pytest --collect-only -q` to log collection sanity and stash both logs under the new timestamp directory.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not reintroduce Python-side φ loops; keep rotations batched and device/dtype neutral.
- Preserve the cached reciprocal recomputation (CLAUDE Rule #13); carryover must reuse tensor caches, not detach to NumPy.
- Avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` inside the simulation hot path; grab scalar diagnostics only in harnesses.
- Leave the red guard tests in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` untouched until gradients pass, then flip them by implementing the fix.
- Maintain Protected Assets: no renaming/removing files referenced in docs/index.md.
- Keep φ step instrumentation change confined to tracing; do not alter production φ generation semantics that already match C.
- Update `fix_checklist.md` and `diagnosis.md` once metrics hit the new thresholds; missing documentation will block sign-off.
- Ensure new artifacts use fresh timestamped directories to keep Attempt history reproducible.

**Summarizing final response details**

I'm putting together a clear, friendly final message that highlights key findings with file path references, outlines updates to plans and input files, and suggests logical next steps—all formatted neatly for easy reading.
[2025-10-07T19:59:13] codex

**Key Points**
- Locked in the evidence: the refreshed traces confirm φ=0 carryover drift (Δk≈1.81e‑2, Δb_y≈4.57×10⁻2 Å) under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/`, so VG‑1 still hinges on emulating nanoBragg’s φ_last reuse.
- Flagged and queued the instrumentation issue (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:1444`)—TRACE_PY_PHI currently samples φ via `(phi_steps-1)`; the plan now requires aligning it with the C loop formula before re-running comparisons.
- Updated supervisory artifacts: L3k.3c.2 is marked done and L3k.3c.3 now calls for the carryover fix plus instrumentation tweak (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:303`, `docs/fix_plan.md:460`); galph memory and `input.md` reflect the new marching orders.

**Next Steps for Ralph**
1. Implement the φ=0 carryover reuse in `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors` and fix the TRACE_PY_PHI step size, then regenerate per‑φ traces and run the compare/pytest commands spelled out in `input.md`.
2. Once VG‑1 is green, roll into L3k.3d (nb-compare ROI parity) per the refreshed plan.
