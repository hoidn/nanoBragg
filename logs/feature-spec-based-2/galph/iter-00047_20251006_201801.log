review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).
  * `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` (≈2993-3151) — definitive implementation of the sincg calls and rounding logic.
  * `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` — simulator reference; docstring currently claims full-h usage and must be updated post-fix.
  * `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative pytest/trace commands for CLI parity evidence.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.

**Reviewing vectorization plan file**
[2025-10-06T20:18:59] exec bash -lc 'cat plans/active/vectorization.md' in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-06T20:19:00] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/vectorization.md' succeeded in 767ms:
## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

**Analyzing plan and codebase for CLI flags**

I’m focusing on understanding the current state of CLI flag support, especially for -nonoise and -pix0_vector, by analyzing the code in `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` and related configs. I’ll also review the fix_plan docs and the plan’s progress on phases like H6 and K2/K3 to identify gaps versus long-term goals, while considering whether debugging hypotheses should be formulated based on instructions.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_notes.md` - Complete evidence summary with metrics tables and next actions
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Phase H6f pivot fix validated:** SAMPLE pivot forcing (Attempt #40) successfully eliminated the 1.14 mm pix0 error; residual deltas now dominated by numerical precision (~3 μm).
      - **Convention handling confirmed:** TRACE_PY shows `detector_convention=CUSTOM`, verifying custom vector presence correctly triggers CUSTOM mode and SAMPLE pivot enforcement.
      - **Beam center consistency:** Fclose/Sclose match exactly (0.0 delta), confirming CLI parsing and mm→m conversion are correct.
      - **Geometry stability:** close_distance delta of 2.84 μm and r_factor delta of 6.8e-8 demonstrate numerical stability across the detector geometry pipeline.
      - **No unit regressions:** All trace values in meters (as required by detector hybrid unit system); no millimeter/Angstrom confusion.
      - **Phase H6g exit criteria met:** |Δpix0| = 2.85 μm << 50 μm threshold; evidence artifacts archived; ready for Phase K2.
    Next Actions: **Phase K2 required** — With pix0 parity confirmed, regenerate scaling-chain analysis with corrected SAMPLE pivot traces. Execute Phase K2 checklist from `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (1) rerun PyTorch trace harness for pixel (1039,685) with final geometry, (2) diff F_latt components against C baseline, (3) update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` with post-H6 comparison, (4) archive refreshed traces under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/`, (5) proceed to Phase K3 regression test once F_latt parity is restored.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #29 (ralph loop) — Result: Phase H5a EVIDENCE-ONLY COMPLETE. **C-code pix0 override behavior with custom vectors documented.**
    Metrics: Evidence-only loop. Two C runs executed: WITH override (pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m) and WITHOUT override (pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m). Identical geometry values confirm override is ignored when custom vectors are present.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/with_override.log` - C run WITH -pix0_vector_mm flag
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/without_override.log` - C run WITHOUT -pix0_vector_mm flag
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/diff.log` - Diff showing only filename difference

**Reviewing root-level binary images and plan evaluation**

I'm noticing that several binary images like `imgC_bin_highcontrast.png` remain at the repo root despite moves in a previous commit, making things messy and worth flagging. I’m gearing up to assess recent commits for artifacts and update the CLI noise plan as needed, especially since new evidence from test metrics suggests fixes haven't fully resolved issues, so I might need to add tasks or phases to the existing plan after a closer look at failure reports and fix attempts.

277:  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #34 (galph loop CG) — Result: Phase B re-opened. New benchmark log `reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/benchmark_results.json` shows warm speedup≈0.30 (PyTorch 1.7738 s vs C 0.5306 s) even with cache hits, contradicting Attempt #33’s 0.828±0.033 average. Investigation found `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` mutates `NB_DISABLE_COMPILE` when `--disable-compile` is toggled while the simulator actually reads `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`, so the flag is ignored and cached compiled simulators bleed across "eager" runs. Because the env var is also unset unconditionally, downstream callers inherit indeterminate compile state and benchmark logs lack mode metadata.

    Metrics: Pytest collection 625 tests successful in 2.71s. Manual sincg validation proves both formulations (C: `sincg(π*h, Na)` and PyTorch: `sincg(π*(h-h0), Na)`) produce identical results (Δ ~2.8e-12, float64 noise level). Trace comparison confirms F_latt components still diverge due to upstream Miller index calculation errors (h Δ=0.097, k Δ=0.024, l Δ=0.120).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_py_after_H3.log` - PyTorch trace after H2 beam vector fix (regenerated)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_py_after_H3.stderr` - Stderr from trace harness run
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/manual_sincg.md` - Manual sincg calculation proving both approaches yield identical results
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation_notes.md` - Updated with 2025-10-06 section rejecting sincg hypothesis and identifying Miller index divergence as root cause
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/pytest_collect.log` - Pytest collection log (625 tests, no breakage)
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **sincg Hypothesis REJECTED:** Manual calculation proves `sincg(π*2.001203, 36) ≈ sincg(π*0.001203, 36)` (both produce ~35.889, matching C expected value)
      - **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Miller indices (h,k,l) themselves differ between C and PyTorch implementations
        - C trace: h=2.001, k=1.993, l=-12.991
        - PyTorch: h=2.098, k=2.017, l=-12.871 (from earlier grep)
        - All deltas exceed 1e-3 threshold (Phase H exit criteria violated)
      - **Upstream Problem:** Miller index calculation `h = q·a*` produces different results despite reciprocal vectors matching (Phase G3)
      - **New Suspects:** (1) Scattering vector calculation - H2 showed 0.06% difference (may be too loose); (2) Pixel position calculation - pix0_vector differs at mm scale; (3) Reciprocal vector rotation needs revalidation
      - F_latt sign/magnitude errors are **symptoms** not root cause - fixing Miller indices will resolve lattice factors
    Next Actions: (1) Compare latest PyTorch trace (trace_py_after_H3.log) with C trace to verify current Miller indices after H2 beam fix; (2) Trace backwards from Miller index calculation: review `h = q·a*` computation in simulator; (3) If scattering vector 0.06% delta is suspect, investigate `q = (k_out - k_in)/λ` calculation; (4) Check if pix0_vector difference needs addressing before lattice work; (5) No code changes until evidence gathering complete per Phase H3 mandate.

## 1. Overview

The Detector class manages the detector geometry for diffraction simulations, including:
- Position and orientation (basis vectors)
- Pixel coordinate generation and caching
- Support for various detector conventions (MOSFLM, XDS)
- Dynamic geometry with rotations and tilts
- Full differentiability for optimization workflows

**Planning detailed plan and fix_plan updates**

I'm mapping out precise modifications for the plan and fix_plan files, including updating context bullets for recent attempts, extending Phase K2 guidance to verify specific metrics like F_cell and F_total, and possibly adding new phased subtasks. I'll ensure references to test metrics failures are integrated carefully, retrofit new tasks consistently, and prepare for editing the files with apply_patch. Afterward, I’ll craft updated memos and finalize instructions per the workflow.

### Phase H5 — Custom Vector Pix0 Override Parity
Goal: Bring PyTorch pix0 precedence back in line with C when custom detector vectors accompany `-pix0_vector_mm`, eliminating the 1.14 mm delta driving the `F_latt` mismatch.
Prereqs: Phase H4 artifacts available; C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.
Exit Criteria: Detector traces with custom vectors show `pix0_vector`, `Fbeam`, and `Sbeam` matching C within 5e-5 m, and fractional h/k/l plus `F_latt_a/b/c` align within 1e-3 relative difference before resuming normalization work.

| H5a | Verify C precedence with explicit derivation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #30. C traces stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/` prove geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are present. `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` carries the dot-product derivation. |
| H5b | Revert PyTorch override when custom vectors supplied | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31 (commit 831b670). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now gates pix0 overrides behind a `has_custom_vectors` check; regression log captured in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/pytest_h5b_revert.log`. Comments cite `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`. |
| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [P] | ✅ Attempt #35 (2025-10-24) captured `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout` and refreshed `parity_summary.md`, but deltas remain large (ΔF = −1136 µm, ΔS = +139 µm). Keep this row in progress until follow-up Phase H6 diagnostics shrink |Δpix0| below the 5e-5 m threshold. |

### Phase H6 — Pix0 Divergence Isolation
Goal: Instrument both implementations to pinpoint the exact step in `_calculate_pix0_vector()` where the PyTorch BEAM-pivot math diverges from nanoBragg.c when custom detector vectors are present.
Prereqs: Phase H5 artifacts archived (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/`), C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`, familiarity with `docs/architecture/detector.md` §5 and specs/spec-a-cli.md precedence rules.
Exit Criteria: New traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/` showing matched step-by-step values, the first divergence documented in `parity_summary.md`, and docs/fix_plan Attempt #36 logging the diagnosis with remediation guidance.

| H6a | Instrument C pix0 calculation | [D] | ✅ Attempt #36 (2025-10-24) captured `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log` plus clean extracts/README. SAMPLE pivot confirmed with C pix0 = (-0.216475836, 0.216343050, -0.230192414) m and basis vectors logged post-rotation. |
| H6b | Extend PyTorch trace harness | [D] | ✅ Attempt #37 (2025-10-06) patched `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py` to emit matching `TRACE_PY` lines after Detector geometry setup, removed the hard-coded BEAM pivot, and executed via `PYTHONPATH=src` to guarantee the editable implementation. Trace archived at `phase_h6/py_trace/trace_py_pix0.log` with env/git snapshots; residual ΔF = −1136 µm confirms instrumentation succeeded and Phase H6c analysis is next. |

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).
  * `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` (≈2993-3151) — definitive implementation of the sincg calls and rounding logic.
  * `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` — simulator reference; docstring currently claims full-h usage and must be updated post-fix.
  * `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative pytest/trace commands for CLI parity evidence.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.

Exit Criteria: Report under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` documenting C vs PyTorch values for `steps`, `I_before_scaling`, `omega`, `polarization`, `r_e²`, `fluence`, and the resulting per-pixel intensities, with the first mismatched quantity identified and logged in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| J1 | Capture single-pixel scaling traces | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-19: C trace (`trace_c_scaling.log`) and PyTorch trace (`trace_py_scaling.log`) captured for pixel (1039,685) with full scaling chain (`steps`, `I_before_scaling`, `r_e²`, `fluence`, `polar`, `omega`). |
| J2 | Compute factor-by-factor ratios | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-19: `analyze_scaling.py` created and executed; identifies first divergence as `I_before_scaling` with Py/C ratio=3.6e-7. Root cause: F_latt components differ by ~463× (C: 35636 vs PyTorch: 76.9). Markdown report at `scaling_chain.md`. |
| J3 | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-19: Attempt #28 logged in `docs/fix_plan.md` with complete metrics, artifacts, and hypothesis (F_latt calculation error in sincg lattice shape factor). Phase I3 remains blocked pending Phase K F_latt fix. |

-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection.

PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
 - Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

-- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
-  1.

Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
-  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
-  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
-  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

**Analyzing data discrepancies and organizing follow-up**

I’m sorting through mismatches in lattice data likely caused by stale traces before the pivot fix and planning a rerun to verify fixes. Alongside this, I’m reviewing commit history for repo cleanup needs and preparing to create a structured input file summarizing goals, phases, focus issues, and branch info for next steps.

 ### Phase L — Final Parity & Regression Sweep


[2025-10-06T20:26:25] thinking

**Preparing detailed documentation and input file**

I'll organize clear priorities with pitfalls and fallback instructions, include environment variables and harness commands without tests, and ensure new files go to the planned reports path. Before writing the new input.md, I want to review the current version to keep the format consistent. I'll also plan to summarize the Step 1 analysis, address outstanding tasks and new issues, and prepare for the upcoming commits and updates.

Summary: Capture post-pivot pix0 evidence so normalization work can safely resume.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare_summary.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/metadata.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_notes.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare/metrics.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/env_snapshot.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6g pix0 trace verification — run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`
If Blocked: Capture command + stderr in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_blocked.log`, note environment (`python -c "import torch, sys; print(sys.version); print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`), stash `git status --short` into the same log, and update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history before pausing.

Context Recap:
- Attempt #40 confirmed SAMPLE pivot forcing when custom detector basis vectors are present (docs/fix_plan.md:448-462).
- Phase H6g remains open in plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145; |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m is the go/no-go threshold.
- Scaling-chain refresh (Phase K2) and regression test (Phase K3) are blocked until H6g artifacts land.
- Previous trace analysis (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/analysis.md) highlighted unit logging mismatches; ensure they do not recur.
- Pivot fix documentation (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md) expects runtime confirmation that pix0 now aligns with C trace values.
- Long-term goal #1 depends on executing the supervisor command parity run; we must clear this evidence gate first.

Evidence Capture Checklist:
1. Ensure working tree clean except for reports (`git status --short`).
2. Create post-fix directory: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix`.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection.

PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

Summary: Refresh scaling-chain evidence after the SAMPLE-pivot fix so we know where normalization still diverges.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase K2 — Recompute scaling chain & extend diagnostics
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after_<timestamp>.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/metrics_after.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_summary.md; docs/fix_plan.md Attempt update draft
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase K2 — run "'`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log` then recompute scaling ratios in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`
If Blocked: Capture stdout/stderr to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/attempt_blocked.log`, append `python - <<'"'PY'"'` snippet printing `sys.version`, `torch.__version__`, `torch.cuda.is_available()`, and `torch.get_default_dtype()`, snapshot `git status --short`, and note blocker in docs/fix_plan Attempt log before pausing.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-461 — refreshed Next Actions make Phase K2 the gating step for long-term goal #1; we need new scaling evidence before touching normalization code.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:171-179 — Phase K2 explicitly demands updated traces explaining `test_metrics_failure.json` ratios.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/test_metrics_failure.json — current correlation≈0.173 data predates the SAMPLE-pivot fix; rerunning will show whether F_latt or F_cell still diverge.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:1-140 — CLI contract ensures lattice normalization must match C once pixel geometry is correct; cite if residual differences remain.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:5-90 — Confirms SAMPLE pivot geometry assumptions now in effect; scaling analysis should no longer be contaminated by pix0 drift.

How-To Map:
- Ensure clean tree except reports: `git status --short` (no code edits in this loop).
- Create working dir: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix`.
- Record environment: `python - <<'"'PY'"'` writing commit hash, sys.version, torch versions, CUDA availability to `metrics_after.json` skeleton (append later with ratios).
- Run harness (Do Now command) to regenerate Py trace with SAMPLE pivot; immediately `cp trace_py_after.log trace_py_after_$(date +%H%M%S).log` for archival.
- Compare against C trace: `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_diff.txt || true`.
- Generate updated scaling markdown: `python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/analyze_scaling.py --c-log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log --py-log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log` (script overwrites phase_j/scaling_chain.md).
- Capture numeric deltas via quick script: `python - <<'"'PY'"'` reading both traces, computing Py/C ratios for `F_cell`, `F_latt`, `I_before_scaling`, `steps`, `polar`, `omega`, writing results to `metrics_after.json` (include absolute diff and ratio fields).
- Summarize findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_summary.md` (reference metrics JSON, highlight first divergence, note if ROUND/GAUSS/TOPHAT need follow-up).
- Update docs/fix_plan Attempt draft (do not commit yet) with metrics, artifact paths, and next-step recommendation.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- No pytest or nb-compare runs this loop; Evidence phase forbids tests.
- Do not edit simulator/crystal/detector code—only generate artifacts.
- Keep harness command prefixed with `PYTHONPATH=src`; without it you may read the installed wheel.
- Avoid overwriting existing `trace_py_scaling.log`; emit new file under phase_k instead.
- Express deltas in meters first (add micron equivalents in parentheses for clarity).
- Make sure `metrics_after.json` stays valid JSON (use `json.dump`, not manual string concatenation).
- If ROUND/GAUSS/TOPHAT not evaluated, note that explicitly—do not mark them complete implicitly.
- Do not delete older artifacts under phase_j/phase_h; append new sections instead.
- Watch for lingering root-level images from prior loops; leave them untouched but note in Attempt log if they interfere.
- Confirm `NB_C_BIN` is set before running any C comparison command; if unset, document that you relied on archived traces only.

Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:178-180 — K2 task definition and expected outputs.
- docs/fix_plan.md:458-461 — Supervisor expectations for this step before K3.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md — Existing report that must be refreshed.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/test_metrics_failure.json — Baseline metrics to supersede.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1-120 — Device/dtype neutrality guidance to cite in notes.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:200-260 — Lattice factor description; update references if ratios remain off.
- tests/test_cli_scaling.py:1-80 — Regression test awaiting green after K3; note location for future loops.

Next Up: If ratios align after rerun, prep command + doc edits for Phase K3 (targeted pytest and doc updates) so the next loop can execute quickly.

 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
-  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.

- Issued new Evidence-phase memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to capture pivot parity evidence and log it under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md` (no code edits yet).
- Next follow-up for Ralph: execute H6e (document pivot mismatch), update parity_summary + fix_plan Attempt log, then proceed to H6f implementation in a subsequent loop.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H6f pivot enforcement prep)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed CLI parity backlog vs long-term goal #1 and vectorization plan status (no edits required yet).
- Deep dive on pix0 gap: Phase H6 evidence confirms C forces SAMPLE pivot when custom vectors are supplied; PyTorch still defaults to BEAM. Normalization remains blocked until pivot + lattice parity close.
- Coin flip → heads: inspected Ralph’s last two commits (`5d0a34d`, `0b7eaf7`). Evidence quality is solid, but parity visuals landed in repo root (`img*_*.png`, `intimage*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) — flagged for relocation into reports before further work.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions for CLI-FLAGS-003 to mark H6e done, add H6f-prep cleanup, and call H6f/H6g/H6 progressions (Attempt #40 reserved for post-fix evidence).
- Issued new implementation memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to move the stray images under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, enforce SAMPLE pivot selection in `DetectorConfig`, add a targeted regression test, rerun focused pytest, and capture post-fix trace output for H6g.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute H6f per memo, log Attempt update + regression artifacts, then pause for supervisor review before H6g.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H6g evidence kickoff)
- `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` returned "Already up to date"; no conflicts encountered.
- Reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 entry (`docs/fix_plan.md:448-462`) and Phase H6 table (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145`); confirmed Attempt #40 landed pivot forcing but H6g artifacts remain outstanding.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context with Attempt #40 recap and marked H6f as `[D]`; rewrote H6g guidance to require post-fix trace + nb-compare artifacts under `reports/…/phase_h6/post_fix/` and to log Attempt #41.
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so list now centers on H6g verification → K2 scaling-chain rerun → K3 regression test → Phase L gating.
- Coin flip → tails, so skipped historical commit audit; focused on evidence planning.
- Authored new `input.md` (Evidence phase) instructing Ralph to rerun the trace harness with pivot fix, capture diff vs C trace, compute deltas, run ROI nb-compare, and prepare Attempt #41 notes; memo also emphasises no pytest this loop.
- Key gap notes: normalization tasks K2/K3 still blocked pending H6g; vectorization plan untouched (Phase A baseline scripts outstanding).
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute H6g evidence capture, archive artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`, then log Attempt #41 in `docs/fix_plan.md` with measured |Δpix0| before touching normalization.

 ### Phase L — Final Parity & Regression Sweep

**Appending detailed changelog entry**

I'll add a new section dated 2025-10-27 with bullet points summarizing the recent updates like plan adjustments, memo creation, commit reviews noting both fixes and leftover artifacts, and guidance on cleaning specific report directories and continuing vectorization efforts, along with a follow-up task for Ralph.

## 2025-10-27 (galph loop — K2 evidence staging)
- "'`git pull --rebase` clean; synced with origin before review.
- Read docs/index.md, specs/spec-a.*, arch.md, config map, debugging SOP, testing_strategy.md to refresh guardrails for CLI parity + scaling work.
- Verified CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempt #41 already landed: pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm with SAMPLE pivot. Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context (new 2025-10-27 snapshot) and marked H6g `[D]`; expanded Phase K2 guidance to demand quantitative ratios explaining `test_metrics_failure.json`.
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so K2 (scaling harness rerun + ratio analysis) and K3 (targeted pytest + docs) are the only blockers before Phase L. Issued replacement Evidence memo in `input.md` targeting K2 harness rerun and scaling markdown refresh.
- Coin flip → heads: reviewed Ralph’s last commits. `ea8092f` (H6f) adds solid pivot forcing + regression test ✅. `921780a` only updates fix_plan. `0b7eaf7` still leaves parity PNG/JPEG artifacts in repo root (img*_*.png, intimage*.jpeg, noiseimage_preview.jpeg) — remind Ralph to relocate/delete once evidence obligations satisfied.
- Noted that `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/test_metrics_failure.json` still reflects pre-pivot ratios (corr≈0.173); next loop must regenerate after SAMPLE pivot to see if F_cell/F_latt remain off.
- Vectorization plan remains untouched; Phase A baselines for tricubic/absorption still pending once CLI parity unblocks bandwidth.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute Phase K2 per new memo, write updated scaling metrics (including F_cell vs C), keep Attempt #41 notes intact, and stage plan for K3 if ratios finally align.

 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

 ### Phase L — Final Parity & Regression Sweep

**Compiling detailed analysis and preparing commit**

I’m gathering a deep analysis for the final message covering progress on long-term goals like CLI parity and vectorization planning, including hypotheses for scaling mismatches and next steps for verification and testing. I’m also noting outstanding issues like large fix_plan files and housekeeping needs before staging and committing all modified files with git.

Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.

 ### Phase L — Final Parity & Regression Sweep


[2025-10-06T20:29:21] thinking

**Composing detailed final response**

I'm putting together a clear, concise final message that summarizes the analysis steps, highlights review findings, outlines debugging hypotheses with confidence rankings and next confirming actions, and mentions plan and input updates. I’ll also include thoughtful next-step suggestions referencing relevant files and commits to keep everything actionable and easy to follow.
[2025-10-06T20:29:23] codex

- Updated CLI parity plan: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:178` now logs H6g as complete, adds a 2025‑10‑27 context snapshot, and expands Phase K2 to demand quantitative ratios for `F_cell`, `F_latt`, and `I_before_scaling`. Synced `docs/fix_plan.md:458` so Next Actions center on K2 → K3 → Phase L. Authored the replacement Evidence memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to rerun the scaling harness and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.

- Long-term goal #1 status: pix0 parity is proven (Attempt #41), but normalization evidence is stale—`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/test_metrics_failure.json` still reflects pre-pivot ratios (corr≈0.173, sum_ratio≈1.46). Plan now blocks on K2 (fresh scaling trace + ratio audit) before K3 regression tests can run. Once those land we can schedule the full supervisor command parity rerun.

- Long-term goal #2: vectorization plan (`plans/active/vectorization.md`) remains untouched; Phase A baseline tests/benchmarks are the entry point once CLI parity unblocks bandwidth. No doc changes needed today, but we should prioritize authoring the tricubic/absorption harnesses when Ralph is free.

- Debugging hypotheses for the lingering intensity mismatch (ranked):
  1. **Outdated Py trace (confidence: medium)** — the current scaling markdown/logs predate SAMPLE pivot enforcement, so the huge ratio likely persists only because the Py trace still reflects BEAM geometry. *Next step:* execute the Do Now harness to regenerate `trace_py_after.log` and rerun `analyze_scaling.py`.  
  2. **Structure-factor lookup still misaligned (confidence: medium-low)** — even with new geometry, if `hkl_frac` stays ≈(2.10, 2.02, −12.88) while C reports ≈(2.00, 1.99, −12.99), `F_cell`/`F_latt` will remain off. *Next step:* after re-running the harness, diff `hkl_frac` lines between C/Py logs.  
  3. **Polarization/omega ordering (confidence: low)** — should ratios remain >1 after lattice parity, double-check Stage J factors (correlation) to ensure polarization and omega application matches spec. *Next step:* inspect updated `scaling_chain.md` for the first remaining ❌ entry.

- Ralph commit audit (coin flip → heads): `ea8092f` cleanly forces SAMPLE pivot with regression coverage—good progress. `921780a` is a harmless fix_plan note. However, `0b7eaf7` dropped parity PNG/JPEG artifacts in repo root (`imgC_bin_highcontrast.png`, `intimage_hq.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`); they still clutter the tree and should be moved under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` or pruned once evidence work is done.

- Housekeeping: docs/fix_plan.md now exceeds 1,300 lines; after K2/K3 it would be wise to archive closed sections into `archive/fix_plan_archive.md` to keep the ledger navigable.

- Deliverables committed: updated plan, fix_plan Next Actions, new `input.md`, and the galph_memory log entry (`galph_memory.md`) describing today’s decisions.

- Natural next steps: Ralph should follow `input.md` to regenerate the scaling trace, write `metrics_after.json`, and log Attempt #42; if ratios fall into tolerance, prepare Phase K3 pytest/doc updates and schedule a cleanup pass for the stray images.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
-  1.

Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
-  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.

-  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.

Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
 - Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
