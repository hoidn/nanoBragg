review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


At this point, you can do a <Callchain tracing> or <Debug> action.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
follow the <Planning> <Action type> instructions
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and follow its instructions.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
- Attempts History: None — new item.
- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh after Attempt #76):
  1. Phase L3c harness audit — Review `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to identify why HKL data isn't loaded despite scaled.hkl containing 168k reflections. Compare against probe.py successful pattern (lines 206-236). Fix attachment to mirror: `F_grid, metadata = read_hkl_file(...); crystal.hkl_data = F_grid; crystal.hkl_metadata = metadata`.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-17): Phase A1 baseline evidence now exists under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (collect log, pytest logs, env.json). A2/A3 remain outstanding—no microbenchmark harnesses yet—so Ralph must prioritise creating the reusable scripts before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-17): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 continues to require the Phase A push (now narrowed to A2/A3). All guidance below assumes Ralph works from a clean editable install with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L3a | Verify structure-factor coverage for supervisor pixel | [ ] | Use the refreshed harness to reproduce the rounded Miller index from C (`trace_c_scaling.log` lines 143-164 → hkl=(-7,-1,-14)). Author a small probe (e.g., `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.py`) that loads `scaled.hkl` via `read_hkl_file` **and** the latest `Fdump.bin` via `read_fdump`, then calls `Crystal.get_structure_factor` for that hkl. Record both outputs and compare against the C reference value `F_cell=190.27`. |
| L3b | Reconcile HKL ingestion with C | [ ] | If the probe shows a mismatch (PyTorch 0 vs C 190.27), inspect the C reader (`nanoBragg.c:2333-2490`) to determine whether additional reflections are synthesized (e.g., via symmetry, padding, or sinc tables) despite the minimal HKL file. Document hypotheses and decide whether the harness must load the generated `Fdump.bin`, expand the HKL grid, or adjust interpolation flags before touching production code. Store notes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis.md`. |
| L3c | Implement scaling fix in simulator | [ ] | After L3a/L3b confirm the correct structure-factor source, modify `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (≈lines 930-1085) so the scaling chain mirrors the C ordering. Include mandatory C-code quotes per Rule #11 and keep the implementation vectorized/device-neutral. |
| L3d | Add targeted regression tests | [ ] | Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with (1) a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) using the agreed data source, and (2) a supervisor-command regression that checks I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, and final intensity against recorded C values within ≤1e-6 relative tolerance. Parametrise over CPU/CUDA when available. |
| L3e | Validate scaling via script | [ ] | Enhance `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` (or create it if missing) to consume the L2 traces plus the new structure-factor data, emit JSON under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/metrics.json`, and fail loudly if any factor exceeds the agreed thresholds. |
| L3f | Update documentation & plans | [ ] | Refresh `docs/fix_plan.md` with the implementation attempt, link the new artifacts, and edit architectural docs (`docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`, `docs/development/testing_strategy.md`) to describe the final normalization + HKL ingestion flow. Mark L3 tasks `[D]` once artifacts are archived. |

### Phase L4 — Supervisor Command Parity Rerun
Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end parity for the supervisor command (correlation ≥ 0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px) and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
Prereqs: L3 validation artifacts show ≤1e-6 deltas for scaling factors; regression tests green.
Exit Criteria: nb-compare metrics meet thresholds, artifacts stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/supervisor_command_rerun/`, docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #56 documents the pass, and this plan is ready for archival.

**Analyzing project status and inconsistencies**

I’m reviewing current issues tied to goals, particularly open CLI tasks blocking parallel test runs and vectorization phases showing conflicting completion states. I plan to inspect the fix_plan entry to clarify vectorization task status using `rg`.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phase A1 complete; A2/A3 evidence outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-17 refresh):
 1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A2–A3: add the reusable `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `absorption_baseline.py` harnesses, capture timing artifacts (CPU and CUDA when available) plus `phase_a/env.json`, and update this entry when logs land. These harnesses remain the gating blocker before design work resumes.
 2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
 3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.
    Metrics: AT-STR-002: 3/3 tests passed in 2.12s (test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled, test_tricubic_out_of_bounds_fallback, test_auto_enable_interpolation). AT-ABS-001: 5/5 tests passed in 5.88s. Collection: 3 tricubic tests found.
    Artifacts:

After Phase L2b harness fix (attaching hkl_data and hkl_metadata):

hkl_data is None? False
hkl_metadata is None? False
h_range: (1, 1)
k_range: (12, 12)
l_range: (3, 3)

Structure factor lookups:
- (1,12,3): F=100.0 ✅ (correct - matches scaled.hkl)
- (-7,-1,-14): F=0.0 ✅ (correct - out of range)

Pixel (685,1039) maps to h≈-7, k≈-1, l≈-14, so F_cell=0 is expected behavior.
This confirms the harness fix is working correctly.

**Analyzing harness and FDUMP usage**

I'm investigating why the harness shows minimal reflection despite analysis indicating otherwise; this might be due to the harness using a stub FDUMP file with limited coverage. I plan to check the `trace_harness.py` script to clarify which FDUMP and HKL files it references.

**Investigating zero structure factor cause**

I'm exploring why the simulation shows zero structure factor despite evidence of reflections in logs. It seems the harness may have read a stub file or mishandled metadata, leading to F_cell=0 after scaling. I'm curious if `Crystal.get_structure_factor` rounds or clamps fractional hkl values differently than expected, causing missed reflections. I'll examine that function in `crystal.py` next.

**Analyzing metadata mismatch and scaled.hkl discrepancies**

I'm exploring why metadata bounds mismatch occurs, suspecting multiple versions of `scaled.hkl` exist—one a minimal stub and another a full grid possibly stored as Fdump.

**Analyzing scattering vector anomalies**

I’m noticing extremely large scattering vector values that might indicate orientation or normalization issues in the crystal data. There’s conflicting metadata about reflection ranges that suggest possible metadata or file reading inconsistencies.

**Outlining debug hypotheses for CLI-FLAGS-003**

I'm putting together a plan to debug why `F_cell` is zero related to structure factor ingestion in the CLI. This involves checking if the `read_hkl_file` call reads only partial or stub data, validating if metadata like `h_max` is set correctly, and investigating if `hkl_data` gets incorrectly reset or mismatched due to device or initialization order issues in the `Crystal` class. I'll inspect files, metadata, and class constructors to pinpoint the root cause.

I plan to check CLI code to see how `-hkl` is handled to pinpoint the root cause.

**Analyzing HKL data discrepancies and planning debugging**

I'm dissecting potential causes for zero F_cell, focusing on mismatches in interpolation flags and HKL metadata truncation. I’m forming hypotheses based on config snapshots and harness logs and planning to draft detailed debug steps, update documentation, and prepare instructions for the next debugging phase to verify scaled.hkl coverage and metadata correctness.

**Analyzing HKL file inconsistencies and planning next steps**

I'm puzzling over why `config_snapshot.json` shows limited HKL ranges despite full data reads—likely because a stub file was used initially and replaced later. I'm focusing on confirming this by having the user re-run probe commands with log preservation strategies to avoid overwriting. I'm drafting detailed instruction plans for logging, test commands, pitfalls, and updating documentation with next actions dated "2025-11-17" to keep the process clear and reproducible.

[2025-10-07T07:21:11] bash -lc 'tail -n 60 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 905ms:
- Long-term Goal #1 status: CLI-FLAGS-003 remains blocked at Phase L2b because `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` still fabricates TRACE_PY lines (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`, `I_pixel_final 0`). Simulator instrumentation already emits real values (see `tests/test_trace_pixel.py`), so harness must capture stdout instead of synthesizing constants.
- Hypothesis summary: (1) Harness bypass writes placeholders → confirmed by lines 263-283 in trace_harness.py; (2) Missing stdout capture leaves trace_py_stdout.txt empty, so scaling_audit_summary.md lacks real numbers. Next step is to pipe the actual TRACE_PY output into trace_py_scaling.log before comparing to C.
- Long-term Goal #2 check: `plans/active/vectorization.md` is still valid; Phase A evidence artifacts remain absent, so no plan rewrite yet. Ensure Ralph captures tricubic/absorption baselines before implementation when that goal activates.
- No new plan drafted; existing CLI plan already captures Phase L2b work. Updated input.md directing Ralph to fix the harness (collect live TRACE_PY output) and rerun targeted regression test.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute revised input.md — update trace_harness.py to record real simulator output, refresh `trace_py_scaling.log`, update scaling_audit_summary.md with live values, then proceed to Phase L2c comparison once numbers land.

## 2025-11-12 (galph loop — L2b harness refresh directive)
- Sync clean; reviewed docs/index.md, specs/spec-a.md shard pointers, arch.md, config map, debugging SOP, testing_strategy.md, docs/fix_plan.md, and plans/active/* before analysis.
- Deep analysis: CLI-FLAGS-003 still blocked because `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` fabricates TRACE_PY entries (see lines 252-281). Latest PyTorch trace with live instrumentation (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after_133134.log`) shows `hkl_frac≈(2,2,-12.99)` and `polar=1.0`, diverging sharply from C trace (`c_trace_scaling.log:265-287` reports `hkl_frac≈(-6.88,-0.607,-13.77)` and `polar=0.9146`). Need authentic TRACE_PY output before tackling normalization.
- Hypotheses triage captured in supervisor summary; top issue remains reciprocal lattice mismatch (likely k-component) pending fresh harness data.
- Coin flip → heads; reviewed Ralph’s recent commits (`f130d19`, `1d2e6ac`, `bcd08b8`). Instrumentation patch clean (no regressions); harness fix partial (still placeholders); comparison tooling solid but awaits real data. No regressions spotted.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` L2b/L2c rows to mark simulator instrumentation/regression complete and call out the remaining harness rerun requirement. Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` next actions to center on harness refresh → comparison rerun → L3 prep.
- Authored new `input.md` instructing Ralph to stream live TRACE_PY output via `debug_config={'trace_pixel': [685,1039]}`, rerun the harness, and validate with the targeted trace test before proceeding to comparison.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute L2b Step 3 (harness refresh + rerun), archive updated logs/env snapshots under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, run the trace regression selector, update Attempts History, then rerun `compare_scaling_traces.py` once real data exists.

## 2025-11-13 (galph loop — CLI harness regression triage)
- Synced clean; traced Phase L2b blockage to `trace_harness.py` still unpacking legacy `read_hkl_file` outputs. Logged the regression as Attempt #70 in docs/fix_plan.md:458-484 and updated the plan gap snapshot / L2b guidance (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:13-18`, `:239-242`).
- Authored new input.md (100 lines) directing Ralph to adapt the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` API, rerun the supervisor command capture, and archive refreshed TRACE_PY artifacts before Phase L2c resumes.
- Focus next loop: confirm harness patch lands, collect live trace data, then execute compare_scaling_traces.py to re-enter normalization analysis.

Summary: Capture tricubic and detector absorption baselines so Phase A clears the runway for vectorization.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 – Vectorize tricubic interpolation and detector absorption
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Runtime Budget: Expect ~30 minutes including GPU runs; keep stopwatch notes for docs/fix_plan.md.
Context Notes: Phase A1 evidence landed (logs + env.json); Phase A2/A3 remain open with no reusable harnesses; fix_plan status now in_progress after latest supervisor audit.
Context Notes: Long-term Goal #2 demands this baseline before any tricubic refactor; no production code changes should occur until these metrics exist.
Context Notes: Repository currently clean aside from supervisor edits; ensure new artifacts stay under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` as per plan.
Context Notes: CUDA is available per env.json; baseline scripts must branch gracefully when GPU absent on other machines.
Context Notes: Protected Assets policy still in effect; do not touch docs/index.md listings.
Context Notes: Ralph’s last loop already ran AT-STR-002/ABS-001; reuse that pattern when validating new scripts.
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py
Metrics Expectation: Record per-size mean/median/stddev plus cold vs warm timings in JSON + Markdown.
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md, reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json, reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/absorption_baseline.md, reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json, reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/env.json, reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/run_log.txt, reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/collection_blocker.log (only if needed)
Baseline Evidence Summary: Existing tricubic/absorption pytest logs confirmed green (Phase A1); new harnesses must extend that evidence with timing/perf data rather than duplicate tests.
Baseline Evidence Summary: Reports folder currently contains only test logs + env snapshot; keep naming consistent (`phase_a/<artifact>`).
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase A2/A3 — author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py`, then run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` and `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`

**Drafting new input.md content**

I'm planning a complete rewrite of `input.md` to align exactly with the required structure and content for the CLI-FLAGS-003 task. I'll carefully organize sections like Summary, Mode, Focus, and others with precise details, instructions, and references, aiming for about 100-200 lines before overwriting the file. This lets me ensure the file matches specs perfectly and supports the related testing and artifact workflows.
[2025-10-07T07:21:50] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Reconfirm HKL coverage for the supervisor command so the scaling trace stops zeroing F_cell.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 – Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm

If Blocked: Copy the probe stdout/stderr to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe_blocker_20251117.log`, record the failure context in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history for CLI-FLAGS-003, and halt before editing any source files.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 pinpoints F_cell=0 as the gating blocker for CLI-FLAGS-003 and now requires a fresh Phase L3a rerun.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:248 spells out the Phase L3a/L3b evidence steps that must precede any simulator edits.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:1 keeps the -hkl/-nonoise flag contract authoritative while we debug ingestion.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1 reminds us of C↔Py HKL parity rules that the probe must satisfy.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1 documents the I_before_scaling divergence we are trying to clear.
How-To Map:
- Back up existing artifacts first: `cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe_20251007.log` (same for analysis.md) so the rerun has a clean diff trail.
- Run the probe command from repo root (see Do Now) and let it regenerate probe.log/analysis.md with current data.
- Immediately copy the fresh outputs to timestamped filenames listed under Artifacts (`cp probe.log probe_20251117.log`, etc.) before any additional runs overwrite them.
- Capture the HKL metadata snapshot by dumping the relevant keys from `trace_harness.py` (e.g., rerun harness or use a short Python snippet) and store results in `harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt`.
- Validate the pytest selector without executing tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/collect_cli_scaling_20251117.log`.
- Diff `probe_20251117.log` against `config_snapshot.json` to identify mismatched h/k/l ranges, then summarize the findings in `analysis_20251117.md`.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not overwrite archived evidence without copying it to a datestamped filename first.
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set for every Python/PyTorch invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- Stay in evidence mode only; no edits to simulator, harness, or CLI code this loop.
- Respect Protected Assets in docs/index.md; avoid renaming or deleting indexed files.
- Do not run the full pytest suite; stick to the collect-only selector listed above.
- Avoid changing device/dtype defaults in scripts—leave probe on CPU/float32 unless a later plan says otherwise.
Pointers:

- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:248 spells out the Phase L3a/L3b evidence steps that must precede any simulator edits.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:1 keeps the -hkl/-nonoise flag contract authoritative while we debug ingestion.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1 reminds us of C↔Py HKL parity rules that the probe must satisfy.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1 documents the I_before_scaling divergence we are trying to clear.
How-To Map:
- Back up existing artifacts first: `cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe_20251007.log` (same for analysis.md) so the rerun has a clean diff trail.
- Run the probe command from repo root (see Do Now) and let it regenerate probe.log/analysis.md with current data.
- Immediately copy the fresh outputs to timestamped filenames listed under Artifacts (`cp probe.log probe_20251117.log`, etc.) before any additional runs overwrite them.
- Capture the HKL metadata snapshot by dumping the relevant keys from `trace_harness.py` (e.g., rerun harness or use a short Python snippet) and store results in `harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt`.
- Validate the pytest selector without executing tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/collect_cli_scaling_20251117.log`.
- Diff `probe_20251117.log` against `config_snapshot.json` to identify mismatched h/k/l ranges, then summarize the findings in `analysis_20251117.md`.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not overwrite archived evidence without copying it to a datestamped filename first.
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set for every Python/PyTorch invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- Stay in evidence mode only; no edits to simulator, harness, or CLI code this loop.
- Respect Protected Assets in docs/index.md; avoid renaming or deleting indexed files.
- Do not run the full pytest suite; stick to the collect-only selector listed above.
- Avoid changing device/dtype defaults in scripts—leave probe on CPU/float32 unless a later plan says otherwise.
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:248
- docs/fix_plan.md:448
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis.md:1
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/config_snapshot.json:1
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:20
Next Up: 1. CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3c harness audit (ensure trace_harness attaches HKL metadata correctly); 2. CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3d regression (add structure-factor lookup assertions in tests/test_cli_scaling.py).

**Summarizing final debug report and next steps**

I'll create a concise final message split into Debug Findings, Guidance Updates, and Next Steps, including key hypotheses with confidence, file references with approximate line numbers, and updates to input.md and fix_plan.md. This will give Ralph a clear overview and actionable items.
[2025-10-07T07:22:30] codex

**Debug Findings**
- Observed mismatch between HKL evidence sources: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis.md:1` confirms `scaled.hkl` (and archived Fdump) contain the (-7,-1,-14) reflection with F=190.27, yet `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/config_snapshot.json:1` still reports h/k/l ranges capped at (1,12,3), and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:20` shows `F_cell 0`.  
- Hypothesis 1: the trace harness is still loading a stub HKL/Fdump dataset (likely from an older cache) even though the repo copy is complete—highest priority and consistent with the conflicting metadata (confidence: high).  
- Hypothesis 2: downstream code may be overwriting `crystal.hkl_metadata` after the harness attaches it, producing the one-reflection ranges; needs verification once fresh probe data is captured (confidence: medium).  
- Hypothesis 3: simulator orientation/scatter calculations could be diverging so badly that the rounded Miller indices fall outside the grid despite coverage; current trace shows sensible rounding, so this remains a low-probability fallback (confidence: low).  
- Next confirming step for Hypothesis 1: re-run `structure_factor/probe.py` on the current workstation and immediately diff the new log against `config_snapshot.json` before touching simulator code.

**Guidance Updates**
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md:448` so CLI-FLAGS-003 now starts with a mandatory Phase L3a probe rerun, followed by harness and CLI audits before regression tests.  
- Adjusted VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 next actions to point straight at Phase B design tasks (B1–B3), reflecting the completed baseline harnesses.  
- Logged the new supervisor context in `galph_memory.md` and published an updated handoff in `input.md:1`, steering Ralph toward the HKL coverage reconciliation.

**Next Steps**
- Follow `input.md` to archive the existing probe artifacts, rerun the probe command with the packaged Fdump, and capture fresh logs under the timestamped names listed.  
- Execute the collect-only selector `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py` (per How-To Map) to document test discovery without running the suite.  
- Compare the refreshed probe output to `config_snapshot.json` and record a concise summary in the new `analysis_20251117.md`; this evidence will drive the subsequent L3c harness fix.  
- Once coverage is confirmed, continue with Phase L3c (trace harness HKL attachment audit) and Phase L3d regression authoring as outlined in the “Next Up” section of `input.md`.
