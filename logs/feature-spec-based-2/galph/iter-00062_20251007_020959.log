run a successful parallel test of pytorch nanobragg against nanobragg c with this command:

nanoBragg  -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl  -nonoise  -nointerpolate -oversample 1  -exposure 1  -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0  -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080  -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866  -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986  -Na 36  -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0

this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:

review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.

do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor evidence mode (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Supervisor Evidence Gate (internal-only): No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Mode flags: Mode flags are combinable and refine execution; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

- Issued new `input.md` (Implementation phase, 107 lines) detailing Phase K1 tasks: swap to `sincg(torch.pi * h, Na)`, rerun scaling traces, author `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`, and update plan/attempt logs with artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/`.
- Follow-up for next supervisor loop: verify Ralph delivers Phase K1 artifacts (trace_py_after.log, scaling_chain_after.md, pytest log) and updates docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #34 before greenlighting Phase K2.

## 2025-10-24 (galph loop — H5c trace refresh directive)
- Re-ran `git pull --rebase` (clean) then reviewed plans/fix_plan/context.
- Noted K1 lattice fix landed in commit 0fef8f7 but plan still marked [ ]; updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:125-133` to mark K1 done, tighten H5c guidance (new 2025-10-24 trace path), and clarify K2/K3 follow-ups.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md:470-480` Next Actions to focus on H5c trace rerun, refreshed scaling chain (K2), and targeted pytest/docs work (K3) before Phase L.
- Flagged that parity summary still referenced pre-unit-fix data; injected TODO banner in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` reminding Ralph to regenerate traces after Attempt #33.
- Issued new supervisor memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to execute H5c trace harness, capture artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/`, and log Attempt #35; memo length trimmed to Evidence-only tasks with expanded timeline.
- No code changes made; repo remains clean pending Ralph’s evidence.
- Follow-up for Ralph: run Do Now command, update parity_summary + fix_plan attempt, then pause for supervisor review before touching Phase K2.

## 2025-10-24 (galph loop — Phase H6 spin-up)
- Coin flip = tails → skipped retrospective review; focused on active CLI parity gap per long-term Goal #1.
- Deep analysis confirms pix0 parity still fails after Attempt #35 (ΔF ≈ -1.136 mm, ΔS ≈ +0.139 mm) even with beam-center mm→m fix; `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` lacked follow-up guidance.
- Added Phase H6 section (H6a–H6d) to `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` and updated H5c state to [P]; plan now requires matched C/Py instrumentation to isolate `_calculate_pix0_vector` divergence.
- Refreshed CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions in `docs/fix_plan.md` to mandate H6 evidence before resuming normalization (K2/K3).
- Issued new `input.md` (Evidence phase) directing Ralph to instrument nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch trace harness, capture logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/`, and log Attempt #36.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute Phase H6a/H6b/H6c tasks, update parity_summary + docs/fix_plan (Attempt #36), then coordinate a targeted fix to collapse pix0 deltas <5e-5 m before returning to Phase K.

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-06): Traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) show the SAMPLE pivot fix leaves residual close-distance deltas (~2.8 µm), which push the fractional Miller index from 2.0012 (C) to 1.9993 (PyTorch). Those 0.002 shifts around integer values amplify sincg results (F_latt_b ≈ +21.6%). Need dtype diagnostics to confirm float32 rounding vs geometry formula drift before coding a fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-07): dtype sweep (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/dtype_sweep/`) rules out precision and exposes a φ-grid mismatch—PyTorch logs `k≈1.9997` (φ=0°) while C logs `k≈1.9928` (φ=0.09°). Next action: capture per-φ traces to align sampling before rerunning normalization tests.
- Diagnostic note (2025-11-08 galph audit): `scripts/trace_per_phi.py` currently subtracts `pix0_vector` from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`, yielding plane-relative vectors instead of sample-to-pixel paths. Fix this double subtraction in the Phase K3f PyTorch harness before recording new parity traces.
- Gap confirmation (2025-11-08 trace diff): Phase K3f base-lattice traces show PyTorch keeps the placeholder unit cell volume (`V≈1 Å^3`) when MOSFLM vectors are supplied, so `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` fails to rescale the real vectors. C multiplies `b*×c*` by `V_cell≈2.4682×10^4 Å^3` before converting to meters, yielding |a|≈26.75 Å; PyTorch leaves |a|≈5.8×10^3 Å, which in turn inflates h/k/l by ≈6 units. Fix requires mirroring the MOSFLM derivation pipeline in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (see `specs/spec-a-core.md` Geometry + `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` 3135-3210).

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-09): Phase A remains untouched; no artifacts exist under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, so Ralph must prioritise A1–A3 baseline capture before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.

- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-11-09 refresh):
  1. Phase L2a — Instrument nanoBragg.c scaling chain and capture TRACE_C logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log` (commit instrumentation separately, then revert per SOP).
  2. Phase L2b — Extend PyTorch trace harness to log identical scaling terms (I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, capture_fraction, steps, r_e², fluence) and store output as `trace_py_scaling.log` in the same directory.
  3. Phase L2c — Diff the traces via `compare_scaling_traces.py`, author `scaling_audit_summary.md` with first-divergence metrics, and log Attempt #55 referencing plan Phase L2.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md` - Full evidence report with metrics, hypotheses, next actions
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/summary.json` - Complete parity metrics (correlation, RMSE, sums, peak distances)

**Analyzing long-term goals and CLI parity status**

I'm digging into the codebase and project goals, focusing on CLI parity and vectorization plans. I want to clarify where we stand on CLI parity blockers and vectorization tasks while considering whether to use the plan tool or hypotheses for debugging. Next, I'll inspect docs/fix_plan.md for vectorization details and check recent commits for context.

- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-09 refresh):
  1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A1–A3: author the reusable `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `absorption_baseline.py` harnesses, capture pytest + timing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, and record Attempt #1 in this entry (currently no artifacts exist, so this is blocking).
  2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
  3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * (pending) — Capture Phase A baseline artifacts and update this log.
- Risks/Assumptions: Must maintain differentiability (no `.item()`, no `torch.linspace` with tensor bounds), preserve device/dtype neutrality (CPU/CUDA parity), and obey Protected Assets rule (all new scripts under `scripts/benchmarks/`). Large tensor indexing may increase memory pressure; ensure ROI caching still works.
- Exit Criteria (quote thresholds from spec):
  * specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 tricubic acceptance tests run without warnings and match C parity within documented tolerances (corr≥0.9995, ≤1e-12 structural duality where applicable).

**Preparing deep codebase analysis**

I'm gathering information on the CLI plan phases, especially Phase L, to identify outstanding tasks and debugging hypotheses related to long-term goal #1. I'll review relevant docs and code snippets, like the simulator scaling in `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py`, to support triaging the parity and scaling mismatch issues. Let's explore these areas to compile a thorough analysis.

19:- Diagnostic note (2025-11-08 galph audit): `scripts/trace_per_phi.py` currently subtracts `pix0_vector` from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`, yielding plane-relative vectors instead of sample-to-pixel paths. Fix this double subtraction in the Phase K3f PyTorch harness before recording new parity traces.
20:- Gap confirmation (2025-11-08 trace diff): Phase K3f base-lattice traces show PyTorch keeps the placeholder unit cell volume (`V≈1 Å^3`) when MOSFLM vectors are supplied, so `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` fails to rescale the real vectors. C multiplies `b*×c*` by `V_cell≈2.4682×10^4 Å^3` before converting to meters, yielding |a|≈26.75 Å; PyTorch leaves |a|≈5.8×10^3 Å, which in turn inflates h/k/l by ≈6 units. Fix requires mirroring the MOSFLM derivation pipeline in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (see `specs/spec-a-core.md` Geometry + `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` 3135-3210).

#### Phase K3f — Base lattice & scattering parity
Goal: Eliminate the Δk≈6.0 mismatch uncovered in K3e by proving base lattice vectors, pixel geometry, and scattering-vector math match C before φ rotation.
Prereqs: K3e per-φ evidence archived; MOSFLM rescale guard (K3a) merged; pix0 SAMPLE pivot parity validated (H6g).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison shows |Δh|, |Δk|, |Δl| < 5e-4 at φ=0° with matching lattice vectors and scattering vectors; scaling_chain.md refreshed with post-fix numbers; docs/fix_plan Attempt #46 logged.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K3f1 | Capture C baseline for lattice + scattering | [D] | ✅ Artifacts captured in `base_lattice/c_trace.log` & `c_stdout.txt` (2025-11-08); trace logs include MOSFLM scaling, real vectors, and φ=0 scattering lines. |
| K3f2 | Extend PyTorch trace harness with matching fields | [D] | ✅ `trace_harness.py` now emits `TRACE_PY_BASE` using the corrected pixel vector path; output stored in `base_lattice/trace_py.log` (float64, CPU). |
| K3f3 | Diff base traces & isolate first divergence | [D] | ✅ `base_lattice/summary.md` compares logs and flags the first divergence at `a_star`/real vectors with ~40.5× magnitude gap, confirming Δh≈6.0 stems from unit-scale drift. |
| K3f4 | Record root cause & fix outline | [D] | 2025-11-08 update appended to `base_lattice/summary.md` documenting the placeholder-volume root cause and the 46ba36b fix; evidence lives under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/`. Coordinate docs/fix_plan Next Actions so K3g3 focuses on scaling parity. |

#### Phase K3g — MOSFLM real-vector rescale implementation
Goal: Mirror nanoBragg.c’s MOSFLM branch so PyTorch recomputes real lattice vectors, volumes, and reciprocal duals from the supplied A* matrix before φ/mosaic rotations.
Prereqs: K3f4 root-cause doc committed; guard tasks K3a/K3b still green.
Exit Criteria: `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` updates documented with in-code C reference, `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` passes at default tolerances, Δh/Δk/Δl in base trace <5e-4, and fix_plan Attempt #46 records parity metrics.

### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L2a | Instrument C scaling chain | [ ] | Add TRACE_C lines around nanoBragg.c intensity scaling loop (lines 3005-3095, 3240-3335). Recompile via `make -C golden_suite_generator`. Run the supervisor command with `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` and stash stdout under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`. Document edits in `instrumentation_notes.md` before removing instrumentation. |
| L2b | Extend PyTorch trace harness | [ ] | Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/trace_harness.py` (or create `phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py`) to log the same quantities: I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, capture_fraction, steps, r_e², fluence, final intensity. Execute with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python trace_harness.py` and store output as `trace_py_scaling.log`. |
| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [ ] | Build a comparison notebook or script (`compare_scaling_traces.py`) that aligns TRACE_C vs TRACE_PY lines and reports percentage deltas per factor. Summarize findings in `scaling_audit_summary.md`, explicitly calling out the earliest divergent term and hypothesized root cause. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #55 with key metrics. |

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L3a | Implement scaling fix in simulator | [ ] | Modify `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (likely around lines 930-1085) to mirror the C normalization order confirmed in L2. Include mandatory C-code quote per Rule #11. Ensure device/dtype neutrality (no `.cpu()`/`.item()` in differentiable paths). |
| L3b | Add targeted regression test | [ ] | Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a supervisor-command fixture that asserts PyTorch I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, and final intensity match pre-recorded C values within tolerances (≤1e-6 relative). Parametrise over CPU/CUDA when available. |

**Reviewing and updating CLI plan status**

I’m checking the current CLI plan and docs to confirm if L2a is marked done and if next steps have shifted to L2b and beyond; this involves verifying status updates in the plan file and the fix_plan documentation after the latest commit to keep progress tracking accurate and set proper next actions.

### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L2a | Instrument C scaling chain | [ ] | Add TRACE_C lines around nanoBragg.c intensity scaling loop (lines 3005-3095, 3240-3335). Recompile via `make -C golden_suite_generator`. Run the supervisor command with `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` and stash stdout under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`. Document edits in `instrumentation_notes.md` before removing instrumentation. |
| L2b | Extend PyTorch trace harness | [ ] | Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/trace_harness.py` (or create `phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py`) to log the same quantities: I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, capture_fraction, steps, r_e², fluence, final intensity. Execute with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python trace_harness.py` and store output as `trace_py_scaling.log`. |
| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [ ] | Build a comparison notebook or script (`compare_scaling_traces.py`) that aligns TRACE_C vs TRACE_PY lines and reports percentage deltas per factor. Summarize findings in `scaling_audit_summary.md`, explicitly calling out the earliest divergent term and hypothesized root cause. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #55 with key metrics. |

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L3a | Implement scaling fix in simulator | [ ] | Modify `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (likely around lines 930-1085) to mirror the C normalization order confirmed in L2. Include mandatory C-code quote per Rule #11. Ensure device/dtype neutrality (no `.cpu()`/`.item()` in differentiable paths). |
| L3b | Add targeted regression test | [ ] | Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a supervisor-command fixture that asserts PyTorch I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, and final intensity match pre-recorded C values within tolerances (≤1e-6 relative). Parametrise over CPU/CUDA when available. |

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-11-09 refresh):
  1. Phase L2a — Instrument nanoBragg.c scaling chain and capture TRACE_C logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log` (commit instrumentation separately, then revert per SOP).
  2. Phase L2b — Extend PyTorch trace harness to log identical scaling terms (I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, capture_fraction, steps, r_e², fluence) and store output as `trace_py_scaling.log` in the same directory.
  3. Phase L2c — Diff the traces via `compare_scaling_traces.py`, author `scaling_audit_summary.md` with first-divergence metrics, and log Attempt #55 referencing plan Phase L2.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md` - Full evidence report with metrics, hypotheses, next actions
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/summary.json` - Complete parity metrics (correlation, RMSE, sums, peak distances)

[2025-10-07T02:15:18] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Capture PyTorch scaling trace for supervisor command to unblock Phase L normalization audit.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — Phase L2 scaling audit
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c (selector check only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log
If Blocked: If harness import fails, capture stdout/stderr plus "'`python -V` into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_failed.log and summarize blockers in notes.md before pausing.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2 requires Py trace before scaling comparison proceeds.
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003 highlights L2b as the next gating step after Attempt #55.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§3.5–3.6 document normalization order that the trace must expose for parity checks.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2.5 mandates parity instrumentation ahead of implementation fixes.
How-To Map:
- Ensure editable install active: `pip install -e .` (skip if already done).
- Create/refresh harness at reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py emitting TRACE_PY lines for I_before_scaling, omega, polarization, capture_fraction, steps, r_e_sqr, fluence, final intensity, plus context header.
- Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor` to match the C trace input set.
- Capture environment metadata: `python - <<'"'PY'"'` script dumping PYTHONPATH, torch.__version__, device availability into trace_py_env.json.
- Validate selector only: `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` and stash log alongside notes.md.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not touch production src files yet; stay at harness/scripts level per plan.
- Honor device/dtype neutrality in harness (device arg, respect float32 default, avoid `.cpu()` conversions).
- Preserve TRACE line schema used in c_trace_scaling.log (`TRACE_PY: key value` with 15 sig figs).
- Avoid rerunning full nb-compare; evidence-only loop forbids supervisor parity rerun right now.
- Keep outputs under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/; no new top-level folders.
- Don'"'t delete/rename any file mentioned in docs/index.md (Protected Assets rule).
- No full pytest runs; stick to "'`--collect-only` while harness-only edits are pending.
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE is set on every torch invocation to prevent MKL conflicts.
- Record command history in notes.md for traceability (timestamp + shell command).
Pointers:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log (C reference values).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/instrumentation_notes.md (expected fields/order).
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md (normalization parity workflow).
- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py (reference for variable names around lines 930-1105).

Summary: Capture a PyTorch-side scaling trace for the supervisor command so Phase L normalization parity can advance.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — Phase L2 scaling audit
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c (selector check only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log

Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_stderr.txt
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_history.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor
If Blocked: If harness import fails or raises during setup, record stdout/stderr plus traceback into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_failed.log, append a brief blocker summary to attempt_history.md, and halt further work pending supervisor guidance.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2 requires the PyTorch trace before any comparison or code edits happen.
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003 logs Attempt #55 and now calls L2b out as the immediate next action.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§3.5–3.6 describe the normalization stack (omega → absorption → r_e² → fluence) that must appear in the trace.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2.5 mandates parity instrumentation before implementation fixes; staying aligned keeps long-term Goal #1 unblocked.
- c_trace_scaling.log already captured for pixel (685,1039); mirroring the same variables is the fastest route to identifying the first surviving mismatch.
- Avoiding premature implementation changes protects against repeating the F_latt misdiagnosis; evidence first keeps scope tight.
How-To Map:
- Step 0: Confirm editable install still active; if unsure, rerun "'`pip install -e .` from repo root and log the command in notes.md.
- Step 1: Inspect `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/instrumentation_notes.md` to copy the variable list, precision, and ordering expected by the C trace.
- Step 2: Author or refresh `trace_harness.py` under the same directory; expose CLI args `--pixel slow fast`, `--out path`, `--config supervisor`, and ensure the script imports from `nanobrag_torch.cli` rather than site-packages.
- Step 3: Inside the harness, instantiate the CLI configuration using the supervisor command parameters (Na=36, Nb=47, Nc=29, oversample=1, flux 1e18, beamsize 1.0 mm, etc.); reuse existing helper utilities from prior phase harnesses where possible.
- Step 4: Force deterministic dtype/device by accepting optional `--device` flag; default to CPU float32 but allow override, and print the chosen device into notes.md.
- Step 5: After running the simulator, extract the scaling quantities: I_before_scaling, omega_pixel, polarization_factor, capture_fraction (or thickstep fallback), r_e_sqr, fluence, steps, final intensity, plus intermediate normalized_intensity; emit each as `TRACE_PY: key value` with 15 significant digits.
- Step 6: Persist the trace to `trace_py_scaling.log` and capture stdout/stderr separately using shell redirection; store them alongside the log for later review.
- Step 7: Generate an environment snapshot via `python - <<'"'PY'"'` capturing `sys.version`, `torch.__version__`, `torch.cuda.is_available()`, selected device, and environment variables relevant to the run; write the JSON into trace_py_env.json.
- Step 8: Document every executed command in notes.md with timestamps (use `date -Iseconds`), adding short bullet commentary about results or anomalies.
- Step 9: Validate test selector only by running `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`; append the console output to notes.md to demonstrate no unintended regressions.
- Step 10: Stage no code changes; leave src/ untouched. If you discover missing instrumentation hooks, escalate rather than editing C again (we already have the necessary C trace).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit production simulator or detector modules during this evidence loop.
- Maintain the protected assets listed in docs/index.md; no deletions, renames, or moves.
- Keep harness device-neutral; no `.cpu()` or hard-coded dtype conversions that would hide GPU issues later.
- Avoid `tensor.item()` when logging scalars; use `.detach().cpu().numpy().item()` only if guaranteed non-differentiable context (better: float(tensor)) but note graph safety.
- Skip nb-compare or other heavy parity runners; supervisor evidence mode limits work to instrumentation.
- Make sure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE precedes any torch import to prevent MKL duplication crashes.
- Check that CLI arguments include `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` exactly as in the supervisor command; harness must not silently drop them.
- Preserve existing trace schemas: `TRACE_PY:` prefix, lower-case keys, no extra whitespace for easier diffing.
- Don'"'t assume availability of CUDA; guard device selection and log if fallback to CPU occurs.
- Keep repository clean except for intentional artifacts; delete temporary scratch files before ending the loop.

**Appending update to galph_memory.md**
[2025-10-07T02:16:07] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' >> galph_memory.md

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase L2b trace directive)
- Synced cleanly; reviewed docs/index.md, specs/spec-a.md, arch.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md, debugging.md, testing_strategy.md, docs/fix_plan.md, and plans/active/* (CLI + vectorization) per SOP.
- Deep analysis: long-term Goal #1 still blocked in Phase L; C scaling trace captured (Attempt #55) but PyTorch trace missing. Goal #2 vectorization remains at Phase A with no artifacts.
- Hypotheses (CLI scaling mismatch):
  1. Missing capture_fraction logging/logic parity between C and PyTorch (confidence: medium; C trace shows capture=1.0, Py harness must confirm). Next step: complete L2b harness and compare capture terms.
  2. Potential omission of polarization factor in Py normalization (confidence: medium-low; previous phases reset default but need trace evidence). Next step: include polarization in Py trace and inspect delta vs C log.
  3. Residual steps normalization drift for oversample=1 (confidence: low; subpixel path divides by steps but needs confirmation). Next step: ensure steps printed from Py trace match C=10.
- Coin flip (heads): reviewed Ralph’s latest commits ("'`3e47b38`, `f3f116b`). Progress solid—HKL parity verified, C scaling trace captured with thorough artifacts, no regressions observed.
- Plan maintenance: Marked Phase L2a as complete in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`; refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to focus on L2b/L2c. input.md now directs Ralph to deliver the PyTorch scaling trace (Phase L2b).
- Follow-up for Ralph: implement Phase L2b per new memo, archive artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, then proceed to L2c diff once trace captured.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2 requires the PyTorch trace before any comparison or code edits happen.
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003 logs Attempt #55 and now calls L2b out as the immediate next action.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§3.5–3.6 describe the normalization stack (omega → absorption → r_e² → fluence) that must appear in the trace.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2.5 mandates parity instrumentation before implementation fixes; staying aligned keeps long-term Goal #1 unblocked.
- c_trace_scaling.log already captured for pixel (685,1039); mirroring the same variables is the fastest route to identifying the first surviving mismatch.
- Avoiding premature implementation changes protects against repeating the F_latt misdiagnosis; evidence first keeps scope tight.

Summary: Capture a PyTorch-side scaling trace for the supervisor command so Phase L normalization parity can advance without touching production code.

Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/readme.md (optional overview once trace succeeds)
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor
If Blocked: If the harness import fails or raises while acquiring configs, capture stdout/stderr plus traceback into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_failed.log, append a blocker note to attempt_history.md, and stop work until supervisor follow-up.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2 shows L2a complete and L2b outstanding; without Py traces we cannot diff scaling factors.
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003 lists L2b/L2c as next actions after Attempt #55; aligning keeps long-term Goal #1 moving.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§3.5–3.6 specify normalization order (steps → omega → absorption → r_e² → fluence) to mirror in TRACE_PY.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2.5 emphasises evidence-first debugging through parallel traces before implementation edits.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log already holds the C-side values for pixel (685,1039); matching fields simplifies Phase L2c.
- The earlier Phase J report identified I_before_scaling as divergent; fresh Py traces verify whether normalization now matches post-K3g fixes.
- Keeping harness work isolated avoids regressions while we remain in supervisor evidence mode.
- Long-term Goal #2 (vectorization) remains blocked pending CLI parity; executing Phase L2b is prerequisite to refocusing on vectorization per docs/index.md priority ladder.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 — Environment readiness: confirm editable install is current ("'`pip install -e .`); log the command and its output in notes.md for traceability.
- Step 1 — Reference C trace: read instrumentation_notes.md to replicate variable names, ordering, and precision used in the C logs; jot key fields in notes.md.
- Step 2 — Harness skeleton: create or update trace_harness.py under the Phase L scaling audit directory; include `argparse` options for pixel coordinates, output path, config preset, optional device, and optional dtype.
- Step 3 — Config loader: inside the harness, import `nanobrag_torch.cli.run` (or equivalent) using `PYTHONPATH=src`, and build the Supervisor command config by mirroring parameters listed in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md.
- Step 4 — Simulator execution: instantiate Detector, Crystal, and Beam configs with the CLI parser, ensure noise is disabled, and run the simulator up to intensity computation without writing files.
- Step 5 — Data capture: after simulation, extract `normalized_intensity`, `omega_pixel`, `capture_fraction` (or last-layer value), `polarization_factor`, `self.r_e_sqr`, `self.fluence`, `steps`, and `physical_intensity` for pixel (685,1039); also log `I_before_scaling` if accessible pre-omega.
- Step 6 — Trace formatting: emit lines in the exact schema `TRACE_PY: key value`, preserving 15 significant digits and explicit units where appropriate (e.g., sr, m², photons/m²) to simplify diffing.
- Step 7 — File outputs: write the trace to trace_py_scaling.log; redirect stdout and stderr to their respective files using shell redirection or Python context managers.
- Step 8 — Metadata: gather environment info via an inline Python snippet capturing Python version, torch version, device availability, git SHA, and CLI arguments; dump JSON to trace_py_env.json and config_snapshot.json.
- Step 9 — Documentation: maintain notes.md with timestamped commands (`date -Iseconds`) followed by the exact command and a short bullet summarizing the outcome; update attempt_history.md once the trace succeeds or fails.
- Step 10 — Selector validation: run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`, capture the output in notes.md, and confirm no unexpected collection failures after harness work.
- Step 11 — Review: inspect trace_py_scaling.log manually to ensure all required keys appear and numerical magnitudes are sane compared to the C trace; flag missing fields immediately.
- Step 12 — Cleanup: remove temporary files, ensure only intended artifacts remain under reports/, and keep the git tree clean aside from new evidence files.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit production modules (`src/nanobrag_torch`) or docs outside the reports/ plan scope during this evidence run.
- Avoid hidden `.item()` calls that would detach tensors prematurely; use `.detach().cpu().item()` only when certain that gradients are irrelevant.
- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—support optional CUDA execution later by parameterising device argument instead of hard-coding CPU.
- Keep Protected Assets intact; verify docs/index.md before creating or moving files, especially around loop.sh, supervisor.sh, input.md.
- No nb-compare or full pytest runs; supervisor evidence gate limits work to instrumentation and targeted collection checks.
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE is set for every torch invocation to avoid MKL duplication errors.
- Include `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` in the harness configuration exactly; omitting them would invalidate the comparison with the C trace.
- Preserve TRACE formatting strictly; deviations complicate automated diff tooling planned for Phase L2c.
- Guard for missing CUDA by handling `--device cuda` gracefully (fall back to CPU with logged warning instead of throwing).
- Avoid writing outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/ to keep artifacts discoverable for the plan cross-reference.
- Keep git clean; commit occurs only after supervisor review, so delete any accidental scratch files before finishing.

Summary: Capture a PyTorch-side scaling trace for the supervisor command so Phase L normalization parity can advance without touching production code.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — Phase L2 scaling audit
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c (selector check only, evidence mode)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log (primary TRACE_PY output)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json (environment snapshot)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md (chronological command log)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_stdout.txt (stdout capture)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_stderr.txt (stderr capture)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_history.md (summary per run)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/config_snapshot.json (CLI args + key parameters)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/readme.md (optional overview once trace succeeds)
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor
If Blocked: If the harness import fails or raises while acquiring configs, capture stdout/stderr plus traceback into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_failed.log, append a blocker note to attempt_history.md, and stop work until supervisor follow-up.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2 shows L2a complete and L2b outstanding; without Py traces we cannot diff scaling factors.
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003 lists L2b/L2c as next actions after Attempt #55; aligning keeps long-term Goal #1 moving.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§3.5–3.6 specify normalization order (steps → omega → absorption → r_e² → fluence) to mirror in TRACE_PY.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2.5 emphasises evidence-first debugging through parallel traces before implementation edits.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log already holds the C-side values for pixel (685,1039); matching fields simplifies Phase L2c.
- The earlier Phase J report identified I_before_scaling as divergent; fresh Py traces verify whether normalization now matches post-K3g fixes.
- Keeping harness work isolated avoids regressions while we remain in supervisor evidence mode.
- Long-term Goal #2 (vectorization) remains blocked pending CLI parity; executing Phase L2b is prerequisite to refocusing on vectorization per docs/index.md priority ladder.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 — Environment readiness: confirm editable install is current ("'`pip install -e .`); log the command and its output in notes.md for traceability.
- Step 1 — Reference C trace: read instrumentation_notes.md to replicate variable names, ordering, and precision used in the C logs; jot key fields in notes.md.
- Step 2 — Harness skeleton: create or update trace_harness.py under the Phase L scaling audit directory; include `argparse` options for pixel coordinates, output path, config preset, optional device, and optional dtype.
- Step 3 — Config loader: inside the harness, import `nanobrag_torch.cli.run` (or equivalent) using `PYTHONPATH=src`, and build the Supervisor command config by mirroring parameters listed in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md.
- Step 4 — Simulator execution: instantiate Detector, Crystal, and Beam configs with the CLI parser, ensure noise is disabled, and run the simulator up to intensity computation without writing files.
- Step 5 — Data capture: after simulation, extract `normalized_intensity`, `omega_pixel`, `capture_fraction` (or last-layer value), `polarization_factor`, `self.r_e_sqr`, `self.fluence`, `steps`, and `physical_intensity` for pixel (685,1039); also log `I_before_scaling` if accessible pre-omega.
- Step 6 — Trace formatting: emit lines in the exact schema `TRACE_PY: key value`, preserving 15 significant digits and explicit units where appropriate (e.g., sr, m², photons/m²) to simplify diffing.
- Step 7 — File outputs: write the trace to trace_py_scaling.log; redirect stdout and stderr to their respective files using shell redirection or Python context managers.
- Step 8 — Metadata: gather environment info via an inline Python snippet capturing Python version, torch version, device availability, git SHA, and CLI arguments; dump JSON to trace_py_env.json and config_snapshot.json.
- Step 9 — Documentation: maintain notes.md with timestamped commands (`date -Iseconds`) followed by the exact command and a short bullet summarizing the outcome; update attempt_history.md once the trace succeeds or fails.
- Step 10 — Selector validation: run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`, capture the output in notes.md, and confirm no unexpected collection failures after harness work.
- Step 11 — Review: inspect trace_py_scaling.log manually to ensure all required keys appear and numerical magnitudes are sane compared to the C trace; flag missing fields immediately.
- Step 12 — Cleanup: remove temporary files, ensure only intended artifacts remain under reports/, and keep the git tree clean aside from new evidence files.

**Planning comprehensive file rewrite**
[2025-10-07T02:18:33] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Capture a PyTorch scaling trace for the supervisor command so Phase L normalization parity can proceed without touching production code.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — Phase L2 scaling audit
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c (selector check only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log — primary TRACE_PY output
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json — environment snapshot
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md — timestamped command log
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_stdout.txt — stdout capture
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_stderr.txt — stderr capture
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_history.md — per-run summary
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/config_snapshot.json — CLI arg/param dump
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/readme.md — optional overview once trace succeeds
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor
If Blocked: If the harness raises during config or execution, capture stdout/stderr plus traceback into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempt_failed.log, append a blocker note to attempt_history.md, and pause for supervisor guidance.
Context: Phase L2a (C trace) is complete and logged as Attempt #55; L2b is now the gating deliverable for long-term Goal #1.
Context: Evidence-only loop — no production code edits, no nb-compare, no full pytest runs beyond selector validation.
Context: Maintain Protected Assets policy; all new files must stay under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase L2 marks L2a [D]; L2b must deliver the PyTorch trace before diffing.
  context: Updating the plan to [D] for L2b depends on producing trace_py_scaling.log with matching fields.
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003 lists L2b/L2c as next actions after Attempt #55.
  context: Staying aligned with the fix plan ledger keeps long-term Goal #1 on schedule.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§3.5–3.6 define normalization order (steps → omega → absorption → r_e² → fluence).
  context: Recording variables in that order simplifies parity comparisons with the C trace.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2.5 mandates trace-driven debugging before implementation work.
  context: Evidence-first approach prevents repeating the earlier F_latt misdiagnosis.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log already captures the C-side values for pixel (685,1039).
  context: Mirroring these fields enables immediate Phase L2c diffing without additional C instrumentation.
- Phase J highlighted I_before_scaling as the first divergent factor.
  context: Fresh Py traces confirm whether normalization drift remains after K3g fixes.
- Long-term Goal #2 (vectorization) remains blocked until CLI parity succeeds.
  context: Completing L2b removes a critical dependency before redirecting effort toward vectorization.

How-To Map:
- Step 0 — Verify editable install: run "'`pip install -e .` (if needed) and log the command plus outcome in notes.md.
  detail: even "Requirement already satisfied" should be recorded for future provenance.
- Step 1 — Review instrumentation guidance: read instrumentation_notes.md and list expected TRACE keys in notes.md.
  detail: include I_before_scaling, omega_pixel_sr, capture_fraction, polarization, r_e_sqr, fluence, steps, and final intensity.
- Step 2 — Prepare harness skeleton at reports/.../trace_harness.py.
  detail: add argparse flags for `--pixel`, `--out`, `--config`, `--device`, and `--dtype` (default float32).
- Step 3 — Load supervisor parameters: import CLI parser with `PYTHONPATH=src`; recreate the command from reports/.../supervisor_command/README.md.
  detail: store parameters in config_snapshot.json for reproducibility.
- Step 4 — Instantiate Detector/Crystal/Beam without noise.
  detail: ensure `-nonoise` is honoured so intensity values match the noiseless C run.
- Step 5 — Run simulator to obtain intensities for full detector.
  detail: keep tensors on selected device; avoid `.cpu()` conversions until logging stage.
- Step 6 — Extract scaling quantities for pixel (slow=685, fast=1039).
  detail: note exact indexing used (e.g., `[685, 1039]`) for each tensor in notes.md.
- Step 7 — Format TRACE lines as `TRACE_PY: key value` with `:.15g` precision and consistent key casing.
  detail: store units in comments if helpful but keep TRACE line pure numeric for diffing.
- Step 8 — Write trace to trace_py_scaling.log and capture stdout/stderr to dedicated files.
  detail: use shell redirection or Python logging to avoid mixing outputs.
- Step 9 — Capture environment via inline Python snippet (sys.version, torch version, cuda availability, git SHA).
  detail: include `platform.platform()` and request device info via torch to aid future comparisons.
- Step 10 — Document workflow in notes.md with ISO timestamps and command list; summarize outcomes per command.
  detail: include elapsed time if easily measured for transparency.
- Step 11 — Update attempt_history.md with the attempt number, artifacts produced, and status (success/blocked).
  detail: note whether all TRACE keys were emitted and any observed anomalies.
- Step 12 — Validate selector only: `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`, append console output to notes.md.
  detail: confirm test collection count matches historical values to catch import regressions.
- Step 13 — Manually review trace_py_scaling.log versus the C trace for sanity (e.g., steps=10, fluence≈1e24).
  detail: record any deviations >5% in notes.md to accelerate Phase L2c diffing.
- Step 14 — Ensure git tree remains clean except for new report artifacts.
  detail: run `git status --short` and list expected files in notes.md.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify src/nanobrag_torch or docs outside the scoped report directory.
  note: any accidental edit should be reverted immediately to keep evidence isolated.
- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that might ever require gradients; prefer `.detach()` before conversion.
  note: this preserves differentiability expectations recorded in docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md.
- Keep device/dtype neutrality; allow optional CUDA execution later by honouring `--device` flag.
  note: default to CPU but log fallback behaviour if CUDA requested and unavailable.
- Obey Protected Assets rule (docs/index.md); do not move or delete loop.sh, supervisor.sh, input.md, etc.
  note: Protected Assets violations are plan blockers.
- No nb-compare or full pytest runs; evidence gate restricts this loop to instrumentation and selector checks.
  note: Phase L4 will handle full parity reruns once scaling aligns.
- Set KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE for every torch process to avoid MKL duplication errors.
  note: log env var usage in notes.md so future loops can replicate the environment.
- Include `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` when constructing the CLI config.
  note: missing either flag invalidates parity with the supervisor command.
- Preserve TRACE formatting exactly; deviations complicate planned compare_scaling_traces tooling.
  note: use lowercase snake_case keys matching the C log.
- Handle missing CUDA gracefully by falling back to CPU with a logged warning.
  note: capture warning in trace_py_stderr.txt for transparency.
- Keep artifacts within reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/ to maintain plan cross-reference integrity.
  note: organize additional files in subdirectories if necessary but stay under this root.

Pointers:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log — authoritative C reference trace.
  usage: match each TRACE_PY key against these values during Phase L2c.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/instrumentation_notes.md — expected fields and precision.
  usage: replicate formatting guidance before running the harness.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md — Phase L2 table updated this loop.
  usage: mark L2b [D] and add Attempt reference once artifacts exist.
- docs/fix_plan.md — Next Actions list now targets L2b/L2c.
  usage: update Attempts history after trace capture to keep ledger synchronized.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md — parity-first workflow and environment requirements.
  usage: cite §2.5 in notes.md to justify evidence-only cadence.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md — normalization order and scaling semantics.
  usage: reference section numbers when annotating future scaling_audit_summary.md.
- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py — source for variables such as normalized_intensity and self.fluence.
  usage: confirm attribute names before accessing them in the harness.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md — canonical parameter list.
  usage: copy parameter values into config_snapshot.json verbatim.
- scripts/validation/analyze_scaling.py — prior art for factor comparisons.
  usage: reuse parsing patterns when building compare_scaling_traces.py.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md — reinforces TRACE schema expectations.
  usage: follow SOP to capture first divergence precisely.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/post_fix/trace_py_after.log — example TRACE formatting.
  usage: mimic spacing and precision for consistency.

Reference Reminders:
- Attempt #55 already archived C trace metrics; Py trace must reference the same pixel and configuration.
- Store command history chronologically in notes.md with ISO timestamps for auditability.
- Capture git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD` in config_snapshot.json to tag evidence to a commit.
- Record any optional flags (device, dtype) used during harness execution in attempt_history.md.
- Leave TODO placeholder in readme.md if summary pending; mark it complete when Phase L2c closes.

Next Up: Phase L2c comparison (build compare_scaling_traces.py and summarize deltas) once the PyTorch scaling trace is archived.

C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°).

[2025-10-07T02:18:47] bash -lc 'tail -n 40 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 747ms:
  * CLI parity: HKL mismatch traced to nanoBragg padding `(range+2)` along each axis; PyTorch `read_fdump`/`write_fdump` still assume compact grids, so structure-factor parity blocks supervisor command. Need to drop padded planes on read and write the padded layout.
  * Normalization gap: Once HKL parity lands, revisit scaling chain — current blockers remain Phase L2+, but no new divergences found today.
  * Vectorization backlog: `plans/active/vectorization.md` still stuck in Phase A; zero artefacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`.
- Hypotheses + triage (CLI parity):
  1. H1 (high confidence): PyTorch Fdump loader ignores the padded plane nanoBragg emits, causing index shifts (Δk≈+10, Δl≈−2…−8). Next confirming step: update read/write to handle padding, then rerun structure-factor parity script. Evidence: analyze_fdump_layout.py, compare_structure_factors metrics (max |ΔF|=5.22e2).
  2. H2 (medium): Even after HKL alignment, residual F_latt differences could stem from remaining MOSFLM real-vector rescale logic—confirm once L1d passes by replaying Phase K base trace. Next step: rerun base_lattice traces post-L1d if mismatch persists.
  3. H3 (medium-low): Cache metadata might desync when multiple caches exist; ensure new regression test guards header vs tensor consistency. Quick check: include metadata assertions in L1c test.
- Coin flip: heads → Reviewed Ralph’s last loops (`85f7606`, `4e73062`). Work is on track: evidence-only commits built `compare_structure_factors.py` and `analyze_fdump_layout.py`, no regressions spotted, attempt logs thorough.
- Plan updates: Marked Phase L1b as complete in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`, refreshed docs/fix_plan.md next-actions to call out padded layout fix, and emitted new input.md (Do Now = Phase L1c parity implementation + regression test).
- Follow-up for Ralph: Implement Phase L1c per new input.md — add roundtrip pytest, adjust HKL IO to mirror padded layout, regenerate parity artefacts, and update fix_plan/plan tables. Proceed to L1d once parity metrics hit ≤1e-6.

## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — L1d parity rerun prep)
- `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` clean; re-read docs/index.md, specs/spec-a-cli.md, arch.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map, debugging SOP, testing_strategy, docs/fix_plan.md, and plans/active/cli-noise-pix0.md/vectorization.md for continuity.
- Coin flip = heads: reviewed Ralph’s latest work (`4e73062`, `572217b`) — HKL layout analysis + padding fix landed with good regression coverage; no regressions spotted.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L snapshot (L1c → [D], new note on Attempt #53) and synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to show L1c completion; left L1d as the active blocker.
- Authored new `input.md` (Mode=Parity) directing Ralph to regenerate the C Fdump cache and rerun `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py` for Phase L1d, storing outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`.
- Hypotheses refined: (1) With padding fix, expect HKL parity to hit max |ΔF| ≤ 1e-6 once rerun; (2) if Δk≈6 persists afterward, capture fresh per-φ traces (Plan K3f/K3g) to isolate reciprocal-vector drift; (3) remaining intensity gap likely tied to sincg normalization order pending new evidence.
- Follow-up for Ralph: Execute L1d per memo, update docs/fix_plan Attempts with metrics, and prep Phase L2 scaling diagnostics if parity clears.

   231	### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
   232	Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
   233	Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
   234	Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

**Adding line numbers for memory entry**
[2025-10-07T02:19:32] exec bash -lc 'nl -ba galph_memory.md | tail -n 60' in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-07T02:19:33] bash -lc 'nl -ba galph_memory.md | tail -n 60' succeeded in 730ms:
  1350	- Authored new supervisor `input.md` directing Ralph to execute K3g3 (targeted pytest + nb-compare + trace refresh) with stamped artifacts and to update scaling_chain/summary plus fix_plan Attempt log.
  1351	- Follow-up for Ralph: run the specified pytest node under parity env, regenerate nb-compare + base-lattice traces, refresh reports/summary, and record Attempt update; if blocked, capture trace logs under `base_lattice/blocked/` and document stall.
  1352	
  1353	## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — Phase L1 HKL parity prep)
  1354	- `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` clean; coin toss = tails so no retrospective audit.
  1355	- CLI-FLAGS-003 still blocked by supervisor command parity (corr≈0.9965, sum_ratio≈1.26e5). Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L with explicit L1–L4 tasks (HKL parity → scaling trace → diagnosis → rerun) and synced docs/fix_plan Next Actions to those steps.
  1356	- Authored new `input.md` (Mode=Parity) directing Ralph to execute Phase L1 by building `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py`, regenerating a stamped `Fdump_scaled` cache, and logging HKL parity metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`.
  1357	- Hypotheses for 1.26e5× intensity gap: (H1) HKL ingestion mismatch (PyTorch grid defaults vs C’s Fdump) — high confidence; next confirming step is L1 comparison script. (H2) Residual scaling-chain divergence post-MOSFLM fix (fluence/polar chain) — medium confidence; confirmation via Phase L2 traces after HKL parity passes.
  1358	- Vectorization goal remains untouched; plan `plans/active/vectorization.md` still at Phase A baseline because `_tricubic_interpolation` falls back to nearest-neighbor for batched tensors (see src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:272+). Keep on radar once CLI parity clears.
  1359	
  1360	## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — L1b prep)
  1361	- Reproduced Phase L1 parity run with a fresh cache (`Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin`); mismatch persists (max |ΔF| 5.22e2, 99,209 voxels). File encodes 182,700 doubles (≈9.5k extra) and shifts reflections (Δk≈+10–12, Δl≈−2…−8), pointing to a layout/ordering discrepancy rather than corruption.
  1362	- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L table (L1a–L1d) to capture completed evidence and new layout-analysis + IO alignment tasks. Logged the addendum referencing the new cache.
  1363	- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` with Phase L1b–L1d focus and recorded Attempt #51 (evidence update). Added layout-analysis to next actions block.
  1364	- Authored `input.md` directing Ralph to implement Phase L1b via a new `scripts/validation/analyze_fdump_layout.py` helper and to stash findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/` before moving to L1c.
  1365	- Follow-up: Ralph to build the layout-analysis script, document axis/order findings in `layout_analysis.md`, update fix_plan attempt log, then proceed to L1c once structure-factor parity holds.
  1366	
  1367	## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — L1c alignment prep)
  1368	- Re-ran repo sync (already clean); reviewed docs/index.md, specs/spec-a shards, arch.md, config map, debugging + testing strategies, fix_plan, and plans/active/.*
  1369	- Deep-dive findings vs goals:

**Composing detailed final message**

I’m organizing a structured final message covering gaps, hypotheses, Ralph’s review, updates, and next steps, carefully referencing files like `input.md`, `plan.md`, and commits by hash, and suggesting actionable items based on Phase L2b implementation.
[2025-10-07T02:19:40] codex

**Current Gaps**
- Phase L scaling audit still lacks the PyTorch trace; `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:231` now marks L2a done but L2b/L2c remain unchecked until `trace_py_scaling.log` exists.  
- Fix-plan Next Actions were refreshed to point squarely at L2b/L2c; see `docs/fix_plan.md:458` for the updated marching orders.  
- Normalization mismatch (sum_ratio≈1.26×10⁵) therefore persists, blocking the supervisor command in long-term Goal #1.  
- Vectorization initiative stays frozen at Phase A because the CLI blockers haven’t cleared; no artifacts yet under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`.

**Hypotheses (ranked)**
- H1 – Capture-fraction parity gap: C trace records capture_fraction=1.0 while PyTorch hasn’t logged the term yet (confidence medium); confirming step is to emit the full scaling trace via Phase L2b.  
- H2 – Polarization application drift: after default corrections, we still need evidence that PyTorch applies the 0.9146 factor seen in the C log (confidence medium-low); check the same field in the forthcoming trace.  
- H3 – Steps divisor mismatch under oversample=1: subpixel branch divides by steps but the single-sample path may differ (confidence low); verify steps=10 in TRACE_PY once L2b lands.

**Ralph Review (coin = heads)**
- Examined commits `3e47b38` and `f3f116b`; HKL parity rerun and C scaling trace capture were thorough, with artifacts and doc updates in place.  
- Evidence loop respected routing rules—no regressions spotted, and attempts logged cleanly.  
- No course corrections needed; momentum is good, just proceed to the PyTorch trace.

**Updates This Loop**
- Marked L2a complete and left L2b/L2c pending in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:238-240`.  
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md:458-461` so Next Actions now target the Py harness and comparison work.  
- Rewrote `input.md:1-121` with a 120-line memo directing Ralph through Phase L2b (device-neutral harness, evidence logging, selector check).  
- Logged findings and hypotheses in `galph_memory.md:1350-1375`, capturing today’s decisions and follow-up expectations.

**Next Steps**
1. Execute Phase L2b per the new memo—author the PyTorch scaling trace harness, capture logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, and document outcomes so L2c can commence.
