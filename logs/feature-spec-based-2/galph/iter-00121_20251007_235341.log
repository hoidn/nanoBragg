in order of decreasing priority:
<1>
run a successful parallel test of pytorch nanobragg against nanobragg c with this command:

nanoBragg  -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl  -nonoise  -nointerpolate -oversample 1  -exposure 1  -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0  -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080  -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866  -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986  -Na 36  -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0

this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

### Crystal Parameters

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Spec alignment note (2025-11-26): `specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214` states φ sampling SHALL follow `phi = phi0 + phistep * tic` with no state carryover. Keep the C-side defect recorded in `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` (§C-PARITY-001) quarantined to parity harnesses; do not promote it to the normative spec or default PyTorch behavior. Track that `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1097-1198` currently caches `_phi_last_cache` to emulate C; the remediation plan must either remove or gate this behavior behind an explicit parity toggle once CLI validation is unblocked.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-23 PM): Attempt #109 regenerated the TRACE_C_PHI log under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/` and re-ran `compare_per_phi_traces.py`; Δk now measures 1.8116e-2 at φ_tic=0 while φ≥1 stay within 2.85e-5, confirming the carryover mismatch and leaving VG-1 blocked until the remediation lands.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-26): Attempts #111 and #113 produced per-φ traces with max Δk=2.845e-05. This still exceeds the VG-1 gate (Δk, Δb_y ≤ 1e-6). Treat those commits as partial progress until fresh traces prove the tighter tolerance.
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-11-27): Spec baseline locked (VG-1 met with ≤1e-6 deltas); parity shim not yet designed. Default path removes `_phi_last_cache`. Need explicit toggle plus regression coverage before L4 supervisor command rerun.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-11-27): Phases A–C complete with gather vectorization merged (commit 12742e5). Polynomial helpers still scalar; detector absorption remains looped. Phase D is the active gate before parity/perf validation (Phase E) and absorption work (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-27 refresh → galph loop i=118):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (parity shim design + implementation)** — Execute `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phases B–C: keep VG-1 spec artifacts on hand, publish the design note, wire the opt-in carryover mode through configs/CLI, and capture parity traces + targeted pytest logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/`.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (dual-mode documentation/tests)** — Follow Phase D of `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` to refresh `diagnosis.md`, `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py`, and related checklists so spec mode remains default while the parity shim is explicitly covered. Archive collect-only outputs for both spec and parity selectors.
3. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:

**Evaluating planning needs and verifying bug status**

I'm reviewing the current plans and tasks related to CLI flags, the phi bug, and vectorization to decide if updates or new multi-turn planning are necessary. I’ll check key docs like `verified_c_bugs.md` and `fix_plan` to verify statuses and confirm if the existing plans cover all goals or need refinement before moving forward.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–C complete; Phase D polynomial vectorization pending)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --device cpu` (and `--device cuda`), plus `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` for detector absorption timing.
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-27 refresh → galph supervision):
  1. Phase D1 — Follow `plans/active/vectorization.md` (Phase D table) to author `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md` with tensor-shape derivations and C references before code edits. Include tap-point plan and cite design_notes §3.
  2. Phase D2 — Implement vectorised `polint`/`polin2`/`polin3` per plan guidance, adding CLAUDE Rule #11 docstrings and ensuring differentiability/device neutrality.
  3. Phase D3 — Extend `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` with `TestTricubicPoly` and capture collect-only evidence under `phase_d/collect.log` prior to targeted pytest runs.
  4. Phase D4 — Execute CPU + CUDA sweeps (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v`) storing logs under `phase_d/pytest_cpu.log` & `phase_d/pytest_cuda.log`; summarise timings in `polynomial_validation.md`.
  5. Phase E staging — After D1–D4 pass, prep `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/` (collect log, benchmark command templates) before launching E1–E3 validation tasks.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.

# Phase D1: Polynomial Validation Worksheet
# Tricubic Interpolation Vectorization

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Git SHA:** (to be recorded after D2 implementation)
**Initiative:** VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 (PERF-PYTORCH-004 backlog)
**Plan Reference:** `plans/active/vectorization.md` Phase D (tasks D1–D4)
**Design Reference:** `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md` Section 3
**Implementation Context:** `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md`

## Executive Summary

This worksheet defines the **tensor-shape contracts**, **C-code reference mappings**, and **validation strategy** for vectorizing the polynomial interpolation helpers (`polint`, `polin2`, `polin3`) that power tricubic structure factor interpolation. Phase C established batched neighborhood gathering producing `(B, 4, 4, 4)` subcubes; Phase D will enable these subcubes to be consumed without Python loops, unlocking GPU parallelism and torch.compile fusion.

**Key Deliverable:** A complete specification for implementing batched polynomial evaluation with clear input/output shapes, C-code mapping per CLAUDE Rule #11, gradient preservation guarantees, and device neutrality requirements. This worksheet serves as the binding contract between design (Phase B), infrastructure (Phase C), and implementation (Phase D2).

**Evaluating next steps and plan updates**

I’m reviewing the current progress, especially Phase D1 completion for vectorization, and considering whether to update plans to reflect that. There’s a big focus on picking a single issue and action type, with vectorization plan updates looking like the best choice, and I’m getting ready to review relevant documentation for that focus.

# nanoBragg Spec A — Conformance & Parallel Tests

This shard enumerates the CLI profile acceptance tests, parallel validation suite, developer tooling expectations, and conformance profiles. Review [spec-a-core.md](spec-a-core.md) for base requirements and [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md) for CLI semantics referenced here.

Parallel Validation Tests (Profile: C-PyTorch Equivalence) — Acceptance Tests (Normative)

References: ../docs/development/testing_strategy.md (parallel trace-driven validation), ../docs/debugging/debugging.md (trace SOP), ../docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (detector geometry triage), ../docs/architecture/undocumented_conventions.md (hidden C behaviors)
Why: testing_strategy and debugging.md define the parallel trace methodology; the detector checklist accelerates geometry debugging; undocumented_conventions flags hidden C behaviors that often break equivalence.

These tests verify that PyTorch implementation produces outputs equivalent to the C reference implementation. They apply to implementations claiming the C-PyTorch Equivalence Profile. These are black-box behavioral tests comparing outputs without examining internal implementation details.

- AT-PARALLEL-001 Beam Center Scales with Detector Size
  - Setup: Test detector sizes 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024 pixels with 0.1mm pixel size, cubic crystal 100Å N=3, λ=6.2Å
  - Expectation: Beam center (mm) SHALL equal detector_pixels/2 × pixel_size_mm; Peak SHALL appear at detector center ±2 pixels; Correlation between C and PyTorch ≥0.9999
  - Failure mode: Fixed beam center at 51.2mm regardless of detector size
  - Implementation:
    - Parity (canonical): `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest -v tests/test_parity_matrix.py -k "AT-PARALLEL-001"`
    - Supplemental PyTorch-only regression: `pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_001.py`

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-11-27): Phases A–C complete with gather vectorization merged (commit 12742e5). Polynomial helpers still scalar; detector absorption remains looped. Phase D is the active gate before parity/perf validation (Phase E) and absorption work (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

    Metrics: Target test PASSED (test_oob_warning_single_fire in 2.16s). All tricubic tests: 8/8 passed in 2.36s. Test collection: 653 tests collected successfully.
    Artifacts:
      - `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` lines 199-314 — New test_oob_warning_single_fire implementation capturing stdout, verifying flag state changes
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.log` — pytest execution log for all 8 tricubic tests
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/status_snapshot.txt` — Phase C2 completion summary with exit criteria checklist
      - `plans/active/vectorization.md` task C2 marked complete (state [D])
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Test successfully captures `_interpolation_warning_shown` flag behavior: first OOB prints warning, second OOB silent
      - Test validates `Crystal.interpolate` flag permanently disables after first OOB detection
      - Test verifies fallback to `default_F` on OOB queries (expected_default=100.0, got 100.0)
      - Test uses stdout capture (io.StringIO) to deterministically assert warning text presence/absence
      - Three-scenario validation: (1) first OOB → warning + disable, (2) second OOB → no warning + still default_F, (3) in-bounds post-disable → nearest-neighbor fallback
      - No code changes to production paths; test-only addition preserves existing behavior
      - All existing tricubic acceptance tests (AT-STR-002) remain passing after test addition
    Next Actions: Execute Phase C3 (shape assertions + device-aware caching) with implementation notes in `phase_c/implementation_notes.md`, then proceed to Phase D polynomial vectorization.

    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:414-462` — Added `(B,4,4,4)` neighborhood assertions, device consistency checks, and output-shape guards (scalar + batched paths).
      - `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md` — New Phase C3 section detailing assertion rationale, device audit findings, and hand-off requirements for Phase D.

**Organizing detailed plan and input preparation**

I’m carefully sorting out the plan steps to keep numbering consistent and clarifying instructions for the input.md file. There’s a lot to balance—ensuring the focus aligns with the vectorization phase, specifying mode and branch, and framing the “Do Now” step to reflect test-driven development by prioritizing test creation first. I’ll confirm branch info next to properly complete input.md.

Summary: Stage Phase D polynomial vectorization by locking in failing tricubic polynomial tests before wiring the batched helpers.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase D polynomial vectorization
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — new tests required
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase D3 – add polynomial regression tests; after authoring run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv (expect failure until D2 lands).
If Blocked: Capture interim notes in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/notes.md and ping supervisor via fix_plan Attempts History before touching production code.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:230 & :595 tie tricubic behavior to 4×4×4 neighborhoods; tests must encode those guarantees before implementation.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §§2–9 define tensor shapes, tap points, and expected gradcheck strategy that D2 must satisfy.
- plans/active/vectorization.md Phase D table now marks D1 [D]; next gate is D2/D3 so we need failing coverage before code changes.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4 stresses device/dtype parity; tests should parametrize over CPU/CUDA to catch regressions early.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md highlights vectorization guardrails; tests should assert batched paths stay loop-free.
How-To Map:
- Add "'`TestTricubicPoly` in tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py per worksheet §9; encode scalar vs batched equality, gradcheck expectation (mark xfail until D2 completes if runtime too heavy).
- Record pytest collection proof: KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --collect-only -q > reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log.
- Execute failing run to confirm coverage: KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log.
- If CUDA available, rerun with TORCH_DEVICE=cuda (or parameterized fixture) and capture to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log once implementation exists.
- Document findings in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md (section: “Pre-implementation test scaffolding”).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not implement vectorized helpers yet; this loop is test-first scaffolding.
- Keep tests device-neutral; guard CUDA parametrization with torch.cuda.is_available().
- Avoid `.item()` in assertions for tensors requiring gradients; use `.detach()` copies only in non-grad paths.
- Respect Protected Assets; do not relocate files referenced in docs/index.md.
- Maintain vectorized expectations—no Python loops over batch dimensions in new tests.
- Use float64 for gradcheck as mandated; wrap in pytest.skip if precision not available.
- Ensure new fixtures honour KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE before importing torch.
- Keep per-test runtime reasonable; scope inputs to small batches (B<=3) to avoid perf cliffs.
- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts History once failing test evidence captured.
Pointers:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:230 defines tricubic neighbourhood semantics needing enforcement.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:595 documents the one-time warning/default_F fallback your tests must continue to protect.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §§2–4 lay out tensor shapes and broadcast rules for D2/D3.
- plans/active/vectorization.md#phase-d details task sequencing and exit criteria.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4 explains device/dtype discipline to mirror in new tests.
Next Up: Implement VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase D2 vectorized polynomials once the tests are red and logged.

If Blocked: Capture interim observations in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/notes.md, record attempted command + error in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log, and halt before touching production code or plan files.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:230-238 mandates tricubic interpolation over 4×4×4 neighbourhoods; failing tests should assert scalar vs batched equality against this contract.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:595-603 codifies default_F fallback and one-time warning semantics; test scaffolding must keep this behaviour observable after vectorization.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §§2-4 describe required tensor shapes, denominator guards, and gradcheck tolerances; tests should mirror those expectations line-for-line.
- plans/active/vectorization.md Phase D table lists D1 as [D]; the immediate gate is D2/D3, so red tests are required before implementation proceeds.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4 emphasises device/dtype parity; new tests must parametrise CPU/CUDA and float32/float64 pathways where practical.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md Sections “Vectorization is mandatory” and “Device/dtype neutrality” provide explicit do/don’t guidance to encode in assertions.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md documents current gather tensor layout "'`(B,4,4,4)`; tests must validate polynomial helpers consume this layout without additional reshaping.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 outline broadcast strategy for lattice sampling; use this to justify chosen test tensors and expected outputs.
- CLAUDE Rule #11 requires in-code C references; pre-writing tests ensures docstrings refer to the same numbered lines (`nanoBragg.c:4150-4187`) cited in the worksheet.
How-To Map:
- Create a dedicated `TestTricubicPoly` class in tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py with fixtures for scalar (`B=1`) and batched (`B=3`) paths, referencing worksheet §9 sample tensors.
- Implement `fixture_polynomial_inputs` producing deterministic tensors: use small integer coordinates to minimise rounding noise; reuse `sub_Fhkl` neighbourhood example from worksheet Table 2.1.
- Add test `test_polint_matches_scalar` comparing existing scalar helper output to the batched candidate (wrap with `pytest.raises(NotImplementedError)` until D2 stub exists) so failure highlights missing vectorization.
- Add test `test_polin2_matches_scalar` verifying nested interpolation order; ensure asserts use `torch.testing.assert_close` with `rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-8` per worksheet guidance.
- Add test `test_polin3_matches_scalar` covering full 3D evaluation and verifying no warnings emitted; capture any warnings with `recwarn` fixture and assert emptiness.
- Include gradient expectation test `test_polynomial_grad_flow` that wraps outputs in a simple sum and checks `.requires_grad` propagation; mark `xfail` until D2 implements vectorized differentiable path.
- Parameterise the suite over `device in {"cpu", "cuda"}` guarding CUDA availability; ensure `sub_Fhkl.to(device)` executed once per test to avoid host/device mismatches.
- Encode dtype coverage by iterating over `[torch.float32, torch.float64]` where gradcheck requires float64, but keep runtime short by reducing batch size under float64.
- Record pytest collection proof: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --collect-only -q | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log` (append timestamp in file header).
- Execute failing CPU run: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log`; expect failures referencing not-yet-implemented vectorized helpers.
- Note expected failure signature (e.g., `AttributeError: module '"'nanobrag_torch.utils.physics' has no attribute 'polint_batched'"'`); capture snippet in implementation_notes.md under "Pre-implementation scaffolding".
- After CPU evidence, rerun on CUDA only if failure mode differs (e.g., due to device parameterization). Wrap command result in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log with explanation if skipped.
- Update reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md with subsections: Inputs used, Assertions encoded, Failure signatures, Device coverage summary, Follow-on requirements for D2.
- Once evidence captured, append Attempt entry in docs/fix_plan.md under VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 noting failing tests, command, duration, and artifact paths.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not stub vectorized helpers inside tests; failures must originate from production code to keep intent clear.
- Avoid large tensor sizes; keep neighbourhood values small to prevent float precision noise at gradcheck tolerances.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is set at script start; tests importing torch without it violate guardrails.
- Do not skip CUDA outright without logging rationale; use `pytest.skip` conditional so report clarifies environment limitations.
- Refrain from mutating existing gather tests; add new class to keep Phase C evidence intact.
- Respect Protected Assets rule: leave docs/index.md references untouched; store new helper scripts only under reports/ or tests/.
- Guard gradcheck with `pytest.importorskip("torch.autograd")` if numerical gradients misbehave, but first confirm input shapes align with worksheet expectations.
- When capturing logs, avoid redirecting to existing evidence files (append or timestamp) to preserve audit trail.
- Keep Attempt numbering consistent; update docs/fix_plan.md only once per major action to avoid churn.
- Do not run full pytest suite this loop; stay targeted per testing_strategy.md instructions.

**Planning significant expansion**
[2025-10-07T23:59:16] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Establish failing tricubic polynomial vectorization tests so Phase D helpers can be implemented under strict spec, parity, and performance guardrails.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase D polynomial vectorization
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — new tests required
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/attempts.yaml
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase D3 – add polynomial regression tests; after authoring run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv (expect failure until D2 lands).
If Blocked: Document the exact failure, command, and environment in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/notes.md; append an Attempt stub in docs/fix_plan.md with “blocked” status; stop before editing production modules or plan documents.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:230-238 requires 4×4×4 tricubic interpolation neighbourhoods and thus motivates assertions comparing scalar vs batched outputs.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:595-603 enforces the one-time warning + default_F fallback when neighbourhoods go OOB; tests must retain detection of this behaviour after vectorization.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §§2-4 specify tensor shapes, denominator guards, tap points, and gradcheck tolerances; the new tests should reference these sections explicitly.
- plans/active/vectorization.md Phase D table already marks D1 [D]; D2/D3 remain pending, so red coverage is prerequisite to implementation.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4-1.5 underline device/dtype neutrality and Do-Now policy; tests must parameterise CPU/CUDA and stage collect-only evidence first.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md sections “Vectorization is mandatory” and “Device/dtype neutrality” provide the checklist items to double-check inside the failing tests.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md §3 records current gather tensor layout "'`(B,4,4,4)`; the test fixtures should match that layout precisely.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 explain broadcast expectations across phi/mosaic/source dimensions, informing chosen tensor shapes.
- CLAUDE Rule #11 requires docstring snippets referencing `nanoBragg.c:4150-4187`; having failing tests prepared ensures implementation can paste the proper C excerpt alongside.
- docs/fix_plan.md §VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 attempts log already notes D1 completion; this loop should add the next Attempt entry once failing coverage exists.
How-To Map:
- 1) Create dedicated fixtures in tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py for deterministic subcubes. Use the worksheet’s Table 2.1 `(sub_Fhkl, h_idx, k_idx, l_idx)` data to avoid rounding surprises.
- 2) Add helper `make_polynomial_inputs(device, dtype)` returning a dataclass or tuple of tensors; keep shapes `(B,4,4,4)` for sub_Fhkl and `(B,4)` for each axis.
- 3) Write `test_polint_matches_scalar` that invokes the current scalar helper inside a comprehension to build expected results, then intentionally calls the yet-to-be-written vectorized API (e.g., placeholder `physics.polint_vectorized`). Assert using `torch.testing.assert_close` with `rtol=1e-6`, `atol=1e-8`.
- 4) Write `test_polin2_matches_scalar` ensuring nested interpolation order (first along h, then k). Use `pytest.raises(AttributeError)` if the vectorized helper is missing so the failure signature is explicit.
- 5) Write `test_polin3_matches_scalar` for full 3D interpolation. Capture warnings via `recwarn`; assert no warnings triggered when inputs are in-bounds.
- 6) Add `test_polynomial_grad_flow` verifying `.requires_grad` propagation from `sub_Fhkl` to output; mark with `pytest.mark.xfail(reason="vectorized helper not implemented")` until D2 lands.
- 7) Parameterise the entire class over `device in ["cpu", "cuda"]`, guarding CUDA availability with `torch.cuda.is_available()` to satisfy testing_strategy device rules.
- 8) Parameterise over dtype by passing `[torch.float32, torch.float64]`; skip gradcheck-related assertions for float32 but ensure float64 path establishes baseline for Phase D2.
- 9) Record collect-only evidence: run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --collect-only -q` and redirect output to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log.
- 10) Execute targeted CPU run: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv`. Capture stdout/stderr to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log.
- 11) If CUDA fixtures were created, rerun with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv -k cuda` and send output to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log (or document skip rationale in implementation_notes.md if GPU unavailable).
- 12) Update reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md with sections: Inputs, Assertions, Failure Signatures, Device Coverage, Next Steps for D2.
- 13) Append or update reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/attempts.yaml summarising command runs with timestamps, seeds, and exit codes.
- 14) After evidence capture, add Attempt entry under docs/fix_plan.md §VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 referencing the failing command, artefact paths, and key observations (e.g., missing helper, mismatched shapes).
- 15) Only after all evidence is logged should you begin coding D2 in a subsequent loop; keep this loop test-only per Perf-mode guidance.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Avoid implementing vectorized helpers prematurely; this loop should leave production code untouched.
- Do not alter Phase C gather tests; keep new tests isolated so regressions remain attributable.
- Resist the temptation to use `.item()` on tensors participating in gradient checks; use `.detach().cpu().numpy()` only in logging outside the computation graph.
- Keep batch sizes small (≤3) to avoid memory spikes during float64 gradcheck preparations.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is exported before importing torch; add check at top of test module if necessary.
- Respect Protected Assets; never rename or relocate files listed in docs/index.md while editing tests or reports.
- Capture environment metadata (Python, torch, CUDA versions) inside implementation_notes.md to ease reproducibility.
- When marking tests `xfail`, include `strict=True` so accidental passes highlight unexpected behaviour once D2 lands.
- Avoid skipping CUDA without context; if device unavailable, log the reason and provide instructions for rerunning when hardware returns.
- Maintain vectorized expectations—tests should avoid Python loops around batch dimensions beyond the scalar baseline reference.
- Keep log files append-only with timestamps to maintain evidence chronology.
- Re-run collect-only after any test module edit to ensure selectors remain valid.
- Do not run full pytest suite; targeted selectors comply with testing_strategy.md to keep feedback fast.
- Ensure new fixtures honour dtype neutrality by calling `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` once, avoiding repeated conversions inside assertions.
- Check for accidental torch default dtype changes; call `torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float32)` at test setup if needed to avoid leaking float64 defaults into production code.

Summary: Establish failing tricubic polynomial vectorization tests so Phase D helpers can be implemented under strict spec, parity, and performance guardrails.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase D polynomial vectorization
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — new tests required
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/attempts.yaml
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase D3 – add polynomial regression tests; after authoring run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv (expect failure until D2 lands).
If Blocked: Document the exact failure, command, and environment in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/notes.md; append an Attempt stub in docs/fix_plan.md with “blocked” status; stop before editing production modules or plan documents.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:230-238 requires 4×4×4 tricubic interpolation neighbourhoods and thus motivates assertions comparing scalar vs batched outputs.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:595-603 enforces the one-time warning + default_F fallback when neighbourhoods go OOB; tests must retain detection of this behaviour after vectorization.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §§2-4 specify tensor shapes, denominator guards, tap points, and gradcheck tolerances; the new tests should reference these sections explicitly.
- plans/active/vectorization.md Phase D table already marks D1 [D]; D2/D3 remain pending, so red coverage is prerequisite to implementation.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4-1.5 underline device/dtype neutrality and Do-Now policy; tests must parameterise CPU/CUDA and stage collect-only evidence first.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md sections “Vectorization is mandatory” and “Device/dtype neutrality” provide the checklist items to double-check inside the failing tests.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md §3 records current gather tensor layout "'`(B,4,4,4)`; the test fixtures should match that layout precisely.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 explain broadcast expectations across phi/mosaic/source dimensions, informing chosen tensor shapes.
- CLAUDE Rule #11 requires docstring snippets referencing `nanoBragg.c:4150-4187`; having failing tests prepared ensures implementation can paste the proper C excerpt alongside.
- docs/fix_plan.md §VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 attempts log already notes D1 completion; this loop should add the next Attempt entry once failing coverage exists.
How-To Map:
- 1) Create dedicated fixtures in tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py for deterministic subcubes. Use the worksheet’s Table 2.1 `(sub_Fhkl, h_idx, k_idx, l_idx)` data to avoid rounding surprises.
- 2) Add helper `make_polynomial_inputs(device, dtype)` returning a dataclass or tuple of tensors; keep shapes `(B,4,4,4)` for sub_Fhkl and `(B,4)` for each axis.
- 3) Write `test_polint_matches_scalar` that invokes the current scalar helper inside a comprehension to build expected results, then intentionally calls the yet-to-be-written vectorized API (e.g., placeholder `physics.polint_vectorized`). Assert using `torch.testing.assert_close` with `rtol=1e-6`, `atol=1e-8`.
- 4) Write `test_polin2_matches_scalar` ensuring nested interpolation order (first along h, then k). Use `pytest.raises(AttributeError)` if the vectorized helper is missing so the failure signature is explicit.
- 5) Write `test_polin3_matches_scalar` for full 3D interpolation. Capture warnings via `recwarn`; assert no warnings triggered when inputs are in-bounds.
- 6) Add `test_polynomial_grad_flow` verifying `.requires_grad` propagation from `sub_Fhkl` to output; mark with `pytest.mark.xfail(reason="vectorized helper not implemented")` until D2 lands.
- 7) Parameterise the entire class over `device in ["cpu", "cuda"]`, guarding CUDA availability with `torch.cuda.is_available()` to satisfy testing_strategy device rules.
- 8) Parameterise over dtype by passing `[torch.float32, torch.float64]`; skip gradcheck-related assertions for float32 but ensure float64 path establishes baseline for Phase D2.
- 9) Record collect-only evidence: run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --collect-only -q` and redirect output to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log.
- 10) Execute targeted CPU run: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv`. Capture stdout/stderr to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log.
- 11) If CUDA fixtures were created, rerun with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv -k cuda` and send output to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log (or document skip rationale in implementation_notes.md if GPU unavailable).
- 12) Update reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md with sections: Inputs, Assertions, Failure Signatures, Device Coverage, Next Steps for D2.
- 13) Append or update reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/attempts.yaml summarising command runs with timestamps, seeds, and exit codes.
- 14) After evidence capture, add Attempt entry under docs/fix_plan.md §VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 referencing the failing command, artefact paths, and key observations (e.g., missing helper, mismatched shapes).
- 15) Only after all evidence is logged should you begin coding D2 in a subsequent loop; keep this loop test-only per Perf-mode guidance.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Avoid implementing vectorized helpers prematurely; this loop should leave production code untouched.
- Do not alter Phase C gather tests; keep new tests isolated so regressions remain attributable.
- Resist the temptation to use `.item()` on tensors participating in gradient checks; use `.detach().cpu().numpy()` only in logging outside the computation graph.
- Keep batch sizes small (≤3) to avoid memory spikes during float64 gradcheck preparations.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is exported before importing torch; add check at top of test module if necessary.
- Respect Protected Assets; never rename or relocate files listed in docs/index.md while editing tests or reports.
- Capture environment metadata (Python, torch, CUDA versions) inside implementation_notes.md to ease reproducibility.
- When marking tests `xfail`, include `strict=True` so accidental passes highlight unexpected behaviour once D2 lands.
- Avoid skipping CUDA without context; if device unavailable, log the reason and provide instructions for rerunning when hardware returns.
- Maintain vectorized expectations—tests should avoid Python loops around batch dimensions beyond the scalar baseline reference.
- Keep log files append-only with timestamps to maintain evidence chronology.
- Re-run collect-only after any test module edit to ensure selectors remain valid.
- Do not run full pytest suite; targeted selectors comply with testing_strategy.md to keep feedback fast.
- Ensure new fixtures honour dtype neutrality by calling `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` once, avoiding repeated conversions inside assertions.
- Check for accidental torch default dtype changes; call `torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float32)` at test setup if needed to avoid leaking float64 defaults into production code.

How-To Map:
- Draft helper `make_polynomial_inputs(device, dtype, batch)` returning `sub_Fhkl`, `h_idx`, `k_idx`, `l_idx`, and `h_frac` per worksheet Table 2.1.
- Use small integer-based tensor values to minimise rounding noise while exercising all indices.
- Add module-level constant `POLY_FIXTURE = torch.tensor([...])` with deterministic data; annotate source referencing worksheet §2.2.
- Introduce `TestTricubicPoly` class scoped to new tests; keep existing gather tests untouched.
- Write `test_polint_matches_scalar_batched` expecting AttributeError or NotImplementedError until D2 adds vectorized helper.
- Write `test_polint_scalar_equivalence_cpu` computing scalar output via list comprehension for baseline comparison.
- Write `test_polin2_matches_scalar_batched` referencing nested interpolation; assert failure message includes helper name for clarity.
- Write `test_polin2_grad_flow` verifying `.grad_fn` presence; mark xfail with strict True if helper missing.
- Write `test_polin3_matches_scalar_batched` comparing full 3D interpolation; assert absence of warnings with recwarn fixture.
- Write `test_polin3_batch_shape_preserved` verifying output shape `(batch,)` even when batched path missing (xfail).
- Write `test_polynomials_support_float64` ensuring dtype override works; skip gracefully if dtype unsupported on CUDA.
- Parameterise over devices using `@pytest.mark.parametrize("device", pytest_helpers.available_devices())` style pattern.
- Parameterise over dtypes `[torch.float32, torch.float64]`; skip float64 on CUDA if hardware lacks support.
- Guard tests with `pytest.importorskip("torch")` and `pytest.importorskip("torch.autograd")` for grad-specific cases.
- Capture collect-only evidence with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --collect-only -q` redirected to reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log.
- Capture failing CPU run with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log`.
- Capture CUDA run if available with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv -k cuda | tee reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log`.
- Record environment metadata (Python, torch, CUDA versions) at top of implementation_notes.md to keep evidence reproducible.
- Update reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md with sections: Fixture design, Assertion strategy, Expected failure signatures, Device coverage, Follow-on steps.
- Populate reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/attempts.yaml with structured entries (timestamp, command, exit_code, log_path).
- Append Attempt entry in docs/fix_plan.md referencing this evidence, emphasising that Phase D3 scaffolding is ready and D2 should implement helpers next.
- Leave production code untouched this loop; D2 implementation happens after red tests exist.
Evidence Checklist:
- Ensure collect.log includes command, timestamp, and exit status line.
- Ensure pytest_cpu.log captures traceback showing missing helper or assertion mismatch.
- Ensure pytest_cuda.log either captures equivalent failure or documents skip reason clearly.
- Ensure implementation_notes.md lists all new test names with short intent descriptions.
- Ensure attempts.yaml records both CPU and CUDA runs individually.
- Ensure docs/fix_plan.md Attempt entry cites polynomial_validation.md as guidance source.
- Ensure git diff shows only test/report/doc updates; no src/ modifications should appear for this loop.
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE environment variable is echoed in logs for audit.
Reporting Steps:
- Add SHA256 checksums for collect.log and pytest logs to implementation_notes.md or a separate hashes.txt file.
- Update reports directory README if one exists to index new artifacts.
- Mention in Attempt log whether gradcheck tests were added but xfailed, including tolerance values.
- Note any skipped device/dtype combinations and articulate rerun conditions.
- Provide pointer to scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py for later Phase E comparisons.
- Prepare short summary paragraph for next loop referencing red tests and target helpers (polint, polin2, polin3).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Avoid modifying existing gather tests or fixtures.
- Avoid using `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradient flow.
- Avoid large batch sizes that could exhaust GPU memory during future gradchecks.
- Avoid running full pytest suite; stick to targeted selectors per testing_strategy.md.
- Avoid embedding helper implementations inside tests; keep failures pointing at production gaps.
- Avoid silent skips; always explain skip conditions in log or implementation notes.
- Avoid overwriting previous evidence files; include timestamps or append mode when logging.
- Avoid forgetting to set strict=True on xfail markers so accidental passes trigger action.
- Avoid writing CUDA-specific asserts without CPU fallbacks; maintain parity across devices.
- Avoid neglecting dtype neutrality; ensure tests convert fixtures with `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` once.
- Avoid forgetting to set torch default dtype back to float32 if modified inside tests.
- Avoid referencing protected files (docs/index.md assets); keep edits scoped to tests/reports/docs.
- Avoid moving plan files; only reference them.
- Avoid skipping documentation updates; record new tests in implementation_notes.md and fix_plan Attempt.
Additional Diagnostics:
- Capture torch.get_default_dtype() inside implementation notes to confirm baseline.
- Record torch.backends.cuda.is_built() result in logs for context.
- Note whether torch.set_float32_matmul_precision is set; may impact future perf checks.
- Include summary of torch.compile status (unused this loop) for completeness.
- Track random seeds used (if any) in attempts.yaml to ensure deterministic behaviour.

Summary: Establish failing tricubic polynomial vectorization tests so Phase D helpers can be implemented under strict spec, parity, and performance guardrails.
Mode: Perf
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase D polynomial vectorization
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — new tests required
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/collect.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cpu.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/pytest_cuda.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/implementation_notes.md; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/attempts.yaml
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase D3 – add polynomial regression tests; after authoring run KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::TestTricubicPoly --maxfail=1 -vv (expect failure until D2 lands).
If Blocked: Document the exact failure, command, and environment in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/notes.md; append an Attempt stub in docs/fix_plan.md with “blocked” status; stop before editing production modules or plan documents.

     4	- Dependencies:
     5	  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
     6	  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
     7	  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
     8	  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
     9	  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
    10	  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
    11	  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
    12	- Status Snapshot (2025-11-27): Phases A–C complete with gather vectorization merged (commit 12742e5). Phase D1 worksheet captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md`; polynomial helpers remain scalar (D2–D4 pending) and detector absorption is still looped. Phase D is the active gate before parity/perf validation (Phase E) and absorption work (Phase F).
    13	- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.
    14	
    15	### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
    16	Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
    17	Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
    18	Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

     1	Summary: Establish failing tricubic polynomial vectorization tests so Phase D helpers can be implemented under strict spec, parity, and performance guardrails.
     2	Mode: Perf
     3	Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 — Phase D polynomial vectorization

     8	If Blocked: Document the exact failure, command, and environment in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/notes.md; append an Attempt stub in docs/fix_plan.md with “blocked” status; stop before editing production modules or plan documents.
     9	Priorities & Rationale:
    10	- specs/spec-a-core.md:230-238 requires 4×4×4 tricubic interpolation neighbourhoods.
    11	- specs/spec-a-core.md:595-603 enforces one-time warning and default_F fallback semantics.
    12	- specs/spec-a-parallel.md sections on AT-STR-002 demand parity against C for interpolated structure factors.
    13	- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §§2-4 define tensor shapes and denominator guards.
    14	- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md §9 enumerates candidate tests; align coverage with that list.
    15	- plans/active/vectorization.md Phase D table marks D1 [D] and expects D2-D4 sequencing next.
    16	- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1.4-1.5 emphasises device/dtype parity and targeted Do Now commands.
    17	- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md sections on vectorization and device neutrality codify guardrails for both tests and implementation.
    18	- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md §3 documents gather tensor layout `(B,4,4,4)` to reuse directly.
    19	- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 describe broadcast expectations that the new tests should validate.
    20	- CLAUDE Rule #11 demands C-code docstrings quoting `nanoBragg.c:4150-4187`; tests will drive readiness for that insertion.

**Composing final project update message**

I’m preparing a clear final message that highlights the vectorization plan readiness, updates to fix_plan and input.md instructions, and a new galph_memory entry, including a reminder about spec verification for phi and outlining next steps for Ralph with tests and implementation tasks. I’ll reference exact file lines and close with suggested next actions.
[2025-10-08T00:00:58] codex

Marked the vectorization initiative as ready to dive into polynomial work and retuned the guidance so Ralph starts with red tests.

- plans/active/vectorization.md:12-54 now calls out the D1 worksheet artifact and records D1 as [D], setting the stage for D2–D4.
- docs/fix_plan.md:2315-2319 updates Next Actions to acknowledge D1’s completion and push directly into D2–D4 deliverables.
- input.md:1-101 is a fresh Perf-mode memo instructing Ralph to author `TestTricubicPoly` coverage (Phase D3) and capture failing CPU/CUDA runs plus collection artefacts.
- galph_memory.md:1778-1784 logs the supervisor context so the next loop knows why the focus shifted to Phase D3.

No tests were run in this supervisor loop.

Next steps for Ralph:
1. Implement the `TestTricubicPoly` scaffolding per input.md, capture collect/fail logs, and record the Attempt.
2. Proceed to Phase D2 vectorized helpers once the new tests are red.
3. Retain evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/` for both CPU and CUDA runs before moving to benchmarks.

   * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
 - First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).

+  1. Phase D1 — Completed 2025-10-07 (Attempt #8). Worksheet lives at `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md`; review only if upstream specs change.
   2. Phase D2 — Implement vectorised `polint`/`polin2`/`polin3` per plan guidance, adding CLAUDE Rule #11 docstrings and ensuring differentiability/device neutrality.
-  3. Phase D3 — Extend `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` with `TestTricubicPoly` and capture collect-only evidence under `phase_d/collect.log` prior to targeted pytest runs.
-  4. Phase D4 — Execute CPU + CUDA sweeps (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py tests/test_at_str_002.py -v`) storing logs under `phase_d/pytest_cpu.log` & `phase_d/pytest_cuda.log`; summarise timings in `polynomial_validation.md`.
