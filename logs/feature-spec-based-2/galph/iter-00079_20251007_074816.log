review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-17): Phase A1 baseline evidence now exists under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (collect log, pytest logs, env.json). A2/A3 remain outstanding—no microbenchmark harnesses yet—so Ralph must prioritise creating the reusable scripts before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-17): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 continues to require the Phase A push (now narrowed to A2/A3). All guidance below assumes Ralph works from a clean editable install with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-06 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`, `.collect.log`, `test_at_abs_001.log`, `env.json`). Re-run only if dependencies change or new warnings appear. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

Configuration dataclasses for nanoBragg PyTorch implementation.

This module defines strongly-typed configuration objects that are intended to
replace the large set of local variables and command-line parsing logic found
in the original C main() function. Each dataclass will correspond to a physical
component of the simulation (Crystal, Detector, Beam).

For a detailed mapping of these dataclass fields to the original nanoBragg.c 
command-line flags, including implicit conventions and common pitfalls, see:
docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md

C-Code Implementation Reference (from nanoBragg.c):
The configuration is currently handled by a large argument-parsing loop
in main(). The future dataclasses will encapsulate the variables set
in this block.

**Analyzing CLI HKL data and metadata handling**

I'm tracing how the CLI attaches both HKL data and metadata, checking if dtype conversions happen correctly, and verifying if metadata gets preserved across different loading paths like Fdump. I want to identify any gaps where metadata might not be set before building the Simulator or during device and dtype conversions, so I’m focusing on code flow in `__main__.py` and planning to note line numbers for precise references. Let's explore this carefully!

**Analyzing device mismatch in Crystal and Simulator**

I'm tracking how tensors move between CPU and GPU in the `Crystal` and `Simulator` code, especially focusing on `self.crystal.hkl_data` which seems to stay on CPU while other data goes to GPU; this mismatch could cause indexing errors. It looks like `Crystal` defaults to CPU device, and the CLI doesn't properly move its tensors to GPU, but `Simulator` tries to operate on GPU tensors. I'm piecing together whether `self.crystal` is converted to GPU somewhere in `Simulator`, since otherwise GPU runs might fail. This is a key spot to flag for a fix or deeper audit!

I’m verifying whether key tensors like `h` and `pixel_coords_angstroms` are on the GPU by tracing their assignment and conversions, suspecting possible GPU-related bugs. Since the focus is the CLI path audit, I’m considering documenting these findings as a detailed report for Ralph, checking if a suitable reports directory exists for saving this summary.

# CLI HKL Ingestion Audit — Phase L3c

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**SHA**: ce51e1cb4f3b5ef43eb5fbde465dc7635df36810
**Purpose**: Audit CLI HKL tensor ingestion to verify dtype/device handling and metadata extraction

## Executive Summary

The CLI successfully parses and loads HKL data from `scaled.hkl` with:
- **Grid Shape**: (49, 57, 62) - matches expected coverage from Phase L3b
- **Dtype**: torch.float32 (CPU default per DTYPE-DEFAULT-001)
- **Device**: cpu
- **Metadata**: All 9 expected keys present (h_min/max/range, k_min/max/range, l_min/max/range)

## Key Findings

1. **HKL Data Successfully Loaded**
   - Grid dimensions (49×57×62) match Phase L3b probe results
   - h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30] coverage confirmed
   - 168,546 reflections (49×57×62) available

**Preparing updated audit documentation**

I’m planning to refresh the existing audit from 2025-10-07 to reflect recent code changes, focusing on verifying the CLI path, data handling gaps, and new findings. I’ll pull the current git commit SHA and append a new dated section in `cli_hkl_audit.md` with these updates, carefully assembling evidence before making documentation edits.

**Preparing audit update with code analysis**

I’m gathering detailed evidence about device handling in the code to document indexing risks between CPU and GPU tensors, then planning to update the audit file by adding a new section referencing these findings and relevant code lines.

+
+- **SHA**: fc600dbdbb7f77adf49280fdd73f14d0ca889166
+- **Scope**: Re-verify CLI HKL ingestion after harness updates (Attempts #74–78) and capture any diverging behavior that Phase L3c still needs to address.
+
+### Findings
+
+1. **Flag → Tensor plumbing still intact**
+   - `parse_and_validate_args()` assigns `config['hkl_data'] = read_hkl_file(...)` or the cached `try_load_hkl_or_fdump(...)` tuple (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`).
+   - `main()` unpacks that tuple and attaches both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing the simulator (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`).
+   - The tuple survives through `config` unchanged; no intermediate code overwrites the metadata.
+
+2. **Device handling gap for CUDA runs**
+   - CLI converts HKL tensors to the requested dtype but never moves them to the requested device (`crystal.hkl_data = hkl_array.clone().detach().to(dtype=dtype)`).
+   - When `-device cuda` is used, `compute_physics_for_position()` (GPU) indexes `self.hkl_data` (CPU), triggering a device mismatch once we reach Phase L parity on CUDA.
+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-17 parity refresh):
  1. Phase L3c harness audit — Mirror the probe attachment pattern inside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` (assign both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata`) and capture a fresh `harness_hkl_state_*.txt`; while doing so, summarize the new probe findings in `analysis.md` so the evidence bundle is self-contained.
  2. Phase L3c CLI verification — Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL-loading path to ensure it applies the same tensor/metadata attachment and device handling as the harness; log results under `reports/.../structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md` before touching simulator internals.
  3. Phase L3d regression — Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) plus a supervisor-scaling expectation check (CPU/CUDA parametrised once the harness proves out).
  4. Phase L3e scaling validation — Enhance or author a `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` helper to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` to document closure before parity.
  5. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-13] Attempt #71 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b validation + Phase L2c complete). **Harness already functional from Attempt #69; executed comparison script to identify first divergence.**
    Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Comparison identifies `I_before_scaling` as first divergent factor (C=943654.809, PyTorch=0, -100% delta).

 # CLI HKL Ingestion Audit — Phase L3c
 
+## 2025-11-17 Re-audit (galph)
+
+- **SHA**: fc600dbdbb7f77adf49280fdd73f14d0ca889166
+- **Scope**: Re-verify CLI HKL ingestion after harness updates (Attempts #74–78) and capture any diverging behavior that Phase L3c still needs to address.
+
+### Findings
+
+1. **Flag → Tensor plumbing still intact**
+   - `parse_and_validate_args()` assigns `config['hkl_data'] = read_hkl_file(...)` or the cached `try_load_hkl_or_fdump(...)` tuple (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`).
+   - `main()` unpacks that tuple and attaches both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing the simulator (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`).
+   - The tuple survives through `config` unchanged; no intermediate code overwrites the metadata.
+
+2. **Device handling gap for CUDA runs**
+   - CLI converts HKL tensors to the requested dtype but never moves them to the requested device (`crystal.hkl_data = hkl_array.clone().detach().to(dtype=dtype)`).
+   - When `-device cuda` is used, `compute_physics_for_position()` (GPU) indexes `self.hkl_data` (CPU), triggering a device mismatch once we reach Phase L parity on CUDA.
+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

**Preparing detailed CLI audit instructions**

I’m working on crafting comprehensive instructions for a targeted CLI ingestion audit focusing on the device gap issue, including running a Python script to capture CPU and optional GPU device details, updating documentation, and running specific tests to gather solid evidence before any code fix.

If Blocked: Capture stdout/stderr to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_device_probe_failure.log, note the exact traceback plus shell/command in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and halt.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:452-468 keeps L3c front-and-center; today’s probe verifies the outstanding device gap before edits.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:270-283 requires CLI audit artifacts ahead of normalization fixes.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md already logs dtype handling; extend it with this CUDA finding so future attempts see the blocker.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:60-140 forbids silent dtype/device drift at the CLI boundary—evidence must show where we violate this.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:20-84 reiterates that CLI inputs must honour caller device/dtype, guiding the upcoming fix.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor
- Run the Python probe above; it emits cpu/cuda HKL tensor metadata to cli_hkl_device_probe.json.
- Record env snapshot: KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python - <<'PY' > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_env.json

PY
- Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md with a short bullet citing the new JSON artifact and noting that the CLI keeps HKL on cpu even when -device cuda is requested.
- Validate the mapped selector: KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/collect_cli_scaling_post_audit.log
- Log Attempt #79 under CLI-FLAGS-003 in docs/fix_plan.md summarizing the device gap and attaching the probe path.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Evidence only: no edits to src/ modules yet.
- Keep all artifacts under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/ with timestamps when adding variants.
- Set KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE for every Python/PyTorch invocation.
- Do not guess at pytest selectors beyond the mapped command; rely on docs/development/testing_strategy.md guidance.
- Leave Protected Assets untouched (docs/index.md guard).
- Avoid hard-coding "'`.cpu()` in scripts; use `.to()` only outside simulator codepaths when logging.
- Stay on feature/spec-based-2; don’t rebase/merge mid-loop.
- No nb-compare or full parity suite until CLI ingestion fix is implemented.
- Document any deviations immediately in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts.

 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

-  2. Phase L3c CLI verification — Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL-loading path to ensure it applies the same tensor/metadata attachment and device handling as the harness; log results under `reports/.../structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md` before touching simulator internals.
+  2. Phase L3c CLI verification — Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL-loading path to ensure it applies the same tensor/metadata attachment and device handling as the harness; today’s re-audit (fc600db) confirms dtype conversion happens but the tensor never moves to `-device cuda`, so document that gap in `cli_hkl_audit.md` and queue a follow-up fix before touching simulator internals.
   3. Phase L3d regression — Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) plus a supervisor-scaling expectation check (CPU/CUDA parametrised once the harness proves out).
   4. Phase L3e scaling validation — Enhance or author a `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` helper to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` to document closure before parity.
   5. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.

 # CLI HKL Ingestion Audit — Phase L3c
 
+## 2025-11-17 Re-audit (galph)
+
+- **SHA**: fc600dbdbb7f77adf49280fdd73f14d0ca889166
+- **Scope**: Re-verify CLI HKL ingestion after harness updates (Attempts #74–78) and capture any diverging behavior that Phase L3c still needs to address.
+
+### Findings
+
+1. **Flag → Tensor plumbing still intact**
+   - `parse_and_validate_args()` assigns `config['hkl_data'] = read_hkl_file(...)` or the cached `try_load_hkl_or_fdump(...)` tuple (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`).
+   - `main()` unpacks that tuple and attaches both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing the simulator (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`).
+   - The tuple survives through `config` unchanged; no intermediate code overwrites the metadata.
+
+2. **Device handling gap for CUDA runs**
+   - CLI converts HKL tensors to the requested dtype but never moves them to the requested device (`crystal.hkl_data = hkl_array.clone().detach().to(dtype=dtype)`).
+   - When `-device cuda` is used, `compute_physics_for_position()` (GPU) indexes `self.hkl_data` (CPU), triggering a device mismatch once we reach Phase L parity on CUDA.
+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

 # CLI HKL Ingestion Audit — Phase L3c
 
+## 2025-11-17 Re-audit (galph)
+
+- **SHA**: fc600dbdbb7f77adf49280fdd73f14d0ca889166
+- **Scope**: Re-verify CLI HKL ingestion after harness updates (Attempts #74–78) and capture any diverging behavior that Phase L3c still needs to address.
+
+### Findings
+
+1. **Flag → Tensor plumbing still intact**
+   - `parse_and_validate_args()` assigns `config['hkl_data'] = read_hkl_file(...)` or the cached `try_load_hkl_or_fdump(...)` tuple (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`).
+   - `main()` unpacks that tuple and attaches both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing the simulator (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`).
+   - The tuple survives through `config` unchanged; no intermediate code overwrites the metadata.
+
+2. **Device handling gap for CUDA runs**
+   - CLI converts HKL tensors to the requested dtype but never moves them to the requested device (`crystal.hkl_data = hkl_array.clone().detach().to(dtype=dtype)`).
+   - When `-device cuda` is used, `compute_physics_for_position()` (GPU) indexes `self.hkl_data` (CPU), triggering a device mismatch once we reach Phase L parity on CUDA.
+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

 # CLI HKL Ingestion Audit — Phase L3c
 
+## 2025-11-17 Re-audit (galph)
+
+- **SHA**: fc600dbdbb7f77adf49280fdd73f14d0ca889166
+- **Scope**: Re-verify CLI HKL ingestion after harness updates (Attempts #74–78) and capture any diverging behavior that Phase L3c still needs to address.
+
+### Findings
+
+1. **Flag → Tensor plumbing still intact**
+   - `parse_and_validate_args()` assigns `config['hkl_data'] = read_hkl_file(...)` or the cached `try_load_hkl_or_fdump(...)` tuple (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`).
+   - `main()` unpacks that tuple and attaches both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing the simulator (`src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`).
+   - The tuple survives through `config` unchanged; no intermediate code overwrites the metadata.
+
+2. **Device handling gap for CUDA runs**
+   - CLI converts HKL tensors to the requested dtype but never moves them to the requested device (`crystal.hkl_data = hkl_array.clone().detach().to(dtype=dtype)`).
+   - When `-device cuda` is used, `compute_physics_for_position()` (GPU) indexes `self.hkl_data` (CPU), triggering a device mismatch once we reach Phase L parity on CUDA.
+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

+   - When `-device cuda` is used, `compute_physics_for_position()` (GPU) indexes `self.hkl_data` (CPU), triggering a device mismatch once we reach Phase L parity on CUDA.
+   - The simulator currently mitigates by copying the returned `F_cell` tensor onto `h.device`, but the advanced indexing before that copy will already fail. Ralph will need to update the CLI attach step (or call `crystal.to(device, dtype)`) during L3 implementation work.
+
+3. **Interpolation flag regression spotted**
+   - CLI still writes `crystal.interpolation_enabled = config['interpolate']` (`__main__.py:1078-1080`) while the `Crystal` API expects `self.interpolate`. This is unrelated to L3c but worth logging so we do not forget that `-interpolate/-nointerpolate` CLI flags are no-ops at present.
+
+### Evidence Collected
+
+- Code references: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:442-448`, `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:1068-1076`
+- Simulator usage reference: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:204-208`
+- Prior audit artifacts remain valid; no new runtime captures were generated this loop.
+
+### Next Actions for Phase L3c
+
+1. Update CLI attachment to move HKL tensors to the CLI-requested device (or run `crystal.to(device, dtype)` immediately after instantiation) and record the change with C-code references in docstrings.
+2. Add a targeted regression test that exercises `-device cuda` with `scaled.hkl` to confirm `crystal.get_structure_factor` works once the device fix lands.
+3. Track the interpolation setter mismatch under the appropriate fix-plan item so Phase L can close without leaving CLI flags in a broken state.

**Composing final summary message**

I'll create a clear summary with bullet points referencing updated files and line locations, mention instructions for Ralph, note next steps like running device probes and updating the fix plan, and remind about committing and pushing changes. This will make the final message organized and straightforward!
[2025-10-07T07:56:34] codex

- Added a 2025‑11‑17 re-audit section noting the HKL tensor/device mismatch and interpolation flag regression (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md:1).
- Flagged the CUDA device gap in the CLI-FLAGS-003 next-actions list so L3c implementation covers it (docs/fix_plan.md:459).
- Logged the new device-probe context for future loops (galph_memory.md:1521).
- Replaced input.md with a Parity-mode handoff directing Ralph to capture `cli_hkl_device_probe.json`, record env metadata, update the audit log, run the mapped selector, and log Attempt #79 before code changes (input.md:1).

Next steps: Ralph should execute the new probe script, refresh the audit doc with the captured JSON/collect-only outputs, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history, and then proceed toward the L3 device fix once evidence is in place.
