review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: run `prompts/callchain.md` with a question‑driven invocation and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.
</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules

- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


At this point, you can do a <Callchain tracing> or <Debug> action.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
follow the <Planning> <Action type> instructions
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and follow its instructions.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
Carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

[2025-10-07T05:47:07] bash -lc 'tail -n 200 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 687ms:
- `git pull --rebase` clean; synced with origin before review.
- Read docs/index.md, specs/spec-a.*, arch.md, config map, debugging SOP, testing_strategy.md to refresh guardrails for CLI parity + scaling work.
- Verified CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempt #41 already landed: pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm with SAMPLE pivot. Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context (new 2025-10-27 snapshot) and marked H6g `[D]`; expanded Phase K2 guidance to demand quantitative ratios explaining `test_metrics_failure.json`.
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so K2 (scaling harness rerun + ratio analysis) and K3 (targeted pytest + docs) are the only blockers before Phase L. Issued replacement Evidence memo in `input.md` targeting K2 harness rerun and scaling markdown refresh.
- Coin flip → heads: reviewed Ralph’s last commits. `ea8092f` (H6f) adds solid pivot forcing + regression test ✅. `921780a` only updates fix_plan. `0b7eaf7` still leaves parity PNG/JPEG artifacts in repo root (img*_*.png, intimage*.jpeg, noiseimage_preview.jpeg) — remind Ralph to relocate/delete once evidence obligations satisfied.
- Noted that `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/test_metrics_failure.json` still reflects pre-pivot ratios (corr≈0.173); next loop must regenerate after SAMPLE pivot to see if F_cell/F_latt remain off.
- Vectorization plan remains untouched; Phase A baselines for tricubic/absorption still pending once CLI parity unblocks bandwidth.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute Phase K2 per new memo, write updated scaling metrics (including F_cell vs C), keep Attempt #41 notes intact, and stage plan for K3 if ratios finally align.

## 2025-10-31 (galph loop — K2 rescope)
- Evidence review shows PyTorch still rescales MOSFLM cross products; C only does so when `user_cell` is set. Root cause for F_latt_b ≈ +21.6% identified. K2b added to plan with required `mosflm_rescale.py` artifact.
- Noted BeamConfig Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C `polarization`). Reopened Phase I2 and updated fix_plan next steps to include default realignment during K3.
- Issued new Evidence memo (input.md) directing Ralph to rerun trace harness, refresh scaling markdown, and capture orientation deltas before touching normalization code.

## 2025-11-05 (galph loop — Phase K3 prep)
- Reviewed CLI parity backlog vs long-term goal #1; confirmed `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` still rescales MOSFLM cross-products and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` remains 1.0, explaining the lingering F_latt and polar deltas.
- Refreshed `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context with a new 2025-11-05 recap and rewrote Phase K into a checklist (K3a–K3c) covering rescale gating, polarization defaults, and regression/docs closure.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions to point at the new Phase K3 tasks and the exact scripts/tests Ralph must run after code changes.
- Issued `input.md` (Implementation phase) instructing Ralph to land K3a–K3c, capture mosflm_rescale + scaling_chain artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/`, and rerun the targeted scaling pytest.
- Follow-up for Ralph: implement the rescale guard + polarization default fix, regenerate scaling evidence, run `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`, then log Attempt #43 before moving to Phase L.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

### Crystal Parameters

| C-CLI Flag | PyTorch Config Field | C Variable | Units/Convention | Critical Notes |
|------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| `-cell a b c al be ga` | `CrystalConfig.cell_a/b/c/alpha/beta/gamma` | `a[0], b[0], c[0], alpha, beta, gamma` | Å and degrees → radians | Must convert degrees to radians internally |
| `-N <val>` | `CrystalConfig.N_cells` | `Na, Nb, Nc` | Number of unit cells | Sets all three axes to same value |

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-11-13 refresh):
  1. Phase L2b harness fix — Update `trace_harness.py` to consume the current `read_hkl_file` `(F_grid, metadata)` signature, rebuild HKL ranges without tuple unpack errors, and capture live TRACE_PY output (`trace_py_scaling.log`) with non-placeholder polarization/absorption values. While touching the harness, mirror the CLI MOSFLM handling by assigning each reciprocal vector to `mosflm_a_star`, `mosflm_b_star`, and `mosflm_c_star` individually; the current harness packs all three into `mosflm_a_star`, leaving the others `None` and forcing default orientation (`F_cell` prints as 0 for hkl=1,12,3).
  2. Phase L2c rerun — Re-execute `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` against the refreshed logs, update `scaling_audit_summary.md`, and record the earliest divergent factor in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.
  3. Phase L3 prep — With real deltas in hand, outline the normalization fix scope (expected focus: polarization application order and F_latt mismatch) and queue targeted regression selectors.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-13] Attempt #71 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b validation + Phase L2c complete). **Harness already functional from Attempt #69; executed comparison script to identify first divergence.**
    Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Comparison identifies `I_before_scaling` as first divergent factor (C=943654.809, PyTorch=0, -100% delta).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:1-41` - Refreshed trace with live values (polar=0.91464138, omega_pixel=4.20404859e-07 sr, F_cell=0, I_before_scaling=0)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1-54` - Phase L2c comparison report showing first divergence and all divergent factors

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborts before capturing TRACE_PY because `read_hkl_file` now returns `(F_grid, metadata)`; `trace_harness.py` still expects the legacy seven-value tuple. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_fullrun.log` for the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` stack trace. As a result `trace_py_scaling_refreshed.log` still contains placeholder values (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`), keeping Phase L2b open until the harness adopts the new API and records live physics data again.
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-09): Phase A remains untouched; no artifacts exist under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, so Ralph must prioritise A1–A3 baseline capture before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.

Summary: Fix the Phase L2b scaling harness so it passes each MOSFLM reciprocal vector individually, captures a live TRACE_PY log, and unlocks the normalization diff.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_fullrun.log

If Blocked: Record the failing stdout/stderr in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempts/<timestamp>/, log the blocker under CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempt History, and park the diff in notes.md before touching normalization.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:239 — L2b guidance now calls out the MOSFLM vector bug; harness must mirror CLI orientation before L2c resumes.
- docs/fix_plan.md:464-472 — Next Actions #1 explicitly require the harness orientation fix; without it F_cell stays 0 and parity analysis is meaningless.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log — Current trace shows F_cell=0 despite scaled.hkl having hkl (1,12,3); fixing the harness should populate real values.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:55-88 — Confirms MOSFLM orientation must be honoured for matrix inputs; use it as the contract while wiring the harness.
- tests/test_trace_pixel.py:22-243 — Regression guard that expects TRACE_PY to emit live physics scalars; keep it green after refactor.

How-To Map:
- Step 1: Edit reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py so lines 157-161 assign `mosflm_a_star=torch.tensor(a_star, ...)`, `mosflm_b_star=torch.tensor(b_star, ...)`, `mosflm_c_star=torch.tensor(c_star, ...)` instead of packing a list. Leave the tensors on the requested device/dtype.
- Step 2: Keep the HKL loader using `F_grid, metadata = read_hkl_file(...)`; after the tweak, re-run the script path to ensure metadata is threaded through without tuple unpack errors.

**Evaluating plan status and next steps**

I'm checking if a new multi-turn plan is needed by reviewing recent commits and plan attempts, especially around the latest harness fix. There’s some numbering confusion with attempts #71 and #72, so I'll dig deeper into the fix plan details to clarify the current state before deciding on the next action.

      - **Pivot:** SAMPLE (custom vectors present, so -pix0_vector_mm override is ignored per C precedence)
      - **Zero rotations:** All angles zero (rotx=0, roty=0, rotz=0, twotheta=0), so pix0 and basis vectors unchanged after rotation

      - **Next critical step:** Phase H6b must generate matching PyTorch trace with identical variable names/units to enable line-by-line diff and identify first divergence
    Next Actions: Proceed to Phase H6b (extend PyTorch trace harness to emit matching TRACE_PY lines from `_calculate_pix0_vector()`), then Phase H6c (diff traces and document first divergence in analysis.md).
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #37 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6b PyTorch trace harness instrumented). **PyTorch pix0 trace captured with TRACE_PY lines matching C format.**

**Evaluating persistent F_cell zero issue**

I'm noticing that even after fixing the harness to assign MOSFLM vectors, the structure factor `F_cell` remains zero, and scattering vectors have huge, likely incorrect values. This suggests the harness still misses key metadata or has bugs in integrating structure factors. I’ll focus on deep analysis to pinpoint where the harness may fail, especially around reading HKL metadata and constructing `CrystalConfig`. Checking the trace harness code next should help clarify the root cause before updating the plan or choosing next debugging steps.

**Analyzing missing HKL data assignment**

I'm investigating why the harness sets `crystal.F_grid` but not `crystal.hkl_data`, leading to `F_cell=0`. I see the missing `hkl_data` and `hkl_metadata` cause `get_structure_factor` to return zero, so I'll form hypotheses around this and consider running targeted Python checks to confirm the issue without altering main code. I'll follow debug steps focusing on parity mode to gather evidence and guide fixes accordingly.

OMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized.
OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.

**Summarizing debugging hypotheses and next steps**

I’m confirming that the harness isn’t setting required attributes, causing F_cell to be zero, which validates the main hypothesis. I’m gathering evidence, organizing hypotheses about missing HKL data and orientation issues, and planning to update debug summaries and instructions for the user to patch the harness and rerun tests to confirm fixes. I’m also considering plan updates to track these steps clearly and thinking about capturing script outputs as artifacts for evidence.

**Planning documentation updates**

I'm reviewing how to update the fix_plan and active plan docs to record our new findings about hooking `crystal.hkl_data`. I want to add a new attempt entry with supervisor observations and tweak the Next Actions section to highlight this missing data hookup, all while keeping edits minimal and consistent with numbering. I'll check the latest attempt entries to maintain proper sequence before making changes.

1075:      - Beam vector incident direction **DOES match** in the trace because the harness explicitly sets `simulator.incident_beam_direction`; CLI wiring still ignores `custom_beam_vector` (see Attempt #7 evidence).

      - **Orientation bug identified:** Harness currently stores all MOSFLM vectors inside `mosflm_a_star`, leaving `mosflm_b_star`/`mosflm_c_star` unset; this forces default orientation and zeroes F_cell even though scaled.hkl contains the reflection.
      - **Ready for comparison:** trace_py_scaling.log now has live values suitable for Phase L2c diff against c_trace_scaling.log
      - **Test coverage maintained:** tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics passes all parametrized variants

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Harness must adapt to the new `(F_grid, metadata)` return, reconstruct `h_min`/`k_min`/`l_min` from metadata, and then pass the grid into the simulator.
      - Until live TRACE_PY values are captured again, Phase L2c cannot identify the first divergent scaling factor.

- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.

      - **Harness functional:** Attempt #70 audit was stale; Attempt #69 already resolved the `(F_grid, metadata)` API change
      - **First divergence confirmed:** `I_before_scaling=0` in PyTorch vs `943654.809` in C indicates missing structure factor (F_cell=0 for reflection 1,12,3)

**Updating attempt observations and actions**

I’m sorting out contradictions in attempts #71 and #72's observations about orientation fixes and missing `hkl_data`. Since the timeline is tricky, I’m planning to add a new attempt #73 reflecting the latest insight, update observations to track both the orientation fix and the missing structure factor, and expand the Next Actions to include hooking `hkl_data`. I’ll carefully patch the bullet point line and insert the new attempt entry to keep history clear.

      - **Root cause hypothesis (updated 2025-11-14):** Harness injects MOSFLM vectors incorrectly (`mosflm_a_star=[a*, b*, c*]`, other slots `None`), so `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` falls back to default orientation and `F_cell` resolves to the default 0.0 despite the HKL grid containing hkl=(1,12,3)
      - **Scaling infrastructure correct:** r_e², fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polar, omega_pixel all match C within tolerances (<0.002% delta)
      - **Test coverage maintained:** tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics passes all parametrized variants
    Next Actions: Phase L3 — Investigate why F_cell=0 for reflection (1,12,3). Check HKL file contents, structure factor lookup logic, and interpolation behavior. Update Phase L plan status to [L2b=D, L2c=D].
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #72 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b harness MOSFLM orientation fix). **Corrected `trace_harness.py` to assign each MOSFLM reciprocal vector to its own config field instead of packing all three into `mosflm_a_star`.**
    Metrics: Harness now produces non-zero F_latt values (F_latt=1.351 vs previous 0), confirming proper orientation. Test suite passes 4/4 variants (tests/test_trace_pixel.py). Comparison script completed successfully (2 divergent factors identified).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:159-161` - Fixed MOSFLM vector assignment (mosflm_a_star, mosflm_b_star, mosflm_c_star as separate tensors)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1-76` - Updated L2c comparison report confirming first divergence at I_before_scaling
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` - Regenerated trace showing live polarization and omega values
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Fix confirmed:** Switching from `mosflm_a_star=[a*, b*, c*]` (list) to individual tensor assignments (mosflm_a_star=tensor(a*), mosflm_b_star=tensor(b*), mosflm_c_star=tensor(c*)) enables Crystal.compute_cell_tensors to use the MOSFLM orientation properly
      - **F_latt now non-zero:** Lattice shape factors are computed correctly (F_latt_a=-2.405, F_latt_b=-0.861, F_latt_c=0.652, product=1.351)
      - **F_cell still zero:** This is expected—pixel (685,1039) computes h=-7,k=-1,l=-14 but scaled.hkl only contains (1,12,3), so structure factor lookup correctly returns 0
      - **Scaling factors verified:** All intermediate scaling terms (r_e², fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polar, omega_pixel) match C within tolerance (Δ<0.002%)
      - **Test coverage maintained:** tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics passes all parametrized variants (4/4)
    Next Actions: Phase L2b complete; L2c evidence captured. Supervisor to proceed with Phase L3 structure-factor investigation based on comparison summary showing I_before_scaling as first divergence.

12:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
15:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
16:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborts before capturing TRACE_PY because `read_hkl_file` now returns `(F_grid, metadata)`; `trace_harness.py` still expects the legacy seven-value tuple. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_fullrun.log` for the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` stack trace. As a result `trace_py_scaling_refreshed.log` still contains placeholder values (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`), keeping Phase L2b open until the harness adopts the new API and records live physics data again.
243:| L2b | Expose and log PyTorch scaling factors | [P] | ✅ Attempt #67 (2025-10-06) patched `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` so `TRACE_PY` emits real `I_before_scaling`, polarization, capture_fraction, and steps; regression `tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics` passes across dtype×device. **Remaining work:** update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to consume the current `read_hkl_file` API `(F_grid, metadata)`, rebuild the HKL cache ranges, and invoke `Simulator(..., debug_config={'trace_pixel': [685, 1039]})` under stdout capture so `trace_py_scaling.log` records live values (no `NOT_EXTRACTED` placeholders). Mirror the CLI MOSFLM handling while doing this—assign each reciprocal vector to `mosflm_a_star`, `mosflm_b_star`, `mosflm_c_star` individually (the harness currently packs all three into `mosflm_a_star`, leaving the others `None`, which forces default orientation and prints `F_cell 0`). Refresh `trace_py_env.json`/`notes.md`, keep the failing `trace_py_fullrun.log` as evidence, then archive the successful rerun before proceeding to L2c. |
244:| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [P] | `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` (Attempt #68, 2025-10-06) already parses TRACE_C/PY and produces markdown.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set.

 ### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation

Summary: Wire the scaling harness into the HKL grid so TRACE_PY sees real structure factors and rerun the L2b comparison.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b) → KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor (after updating the harness to attach "'`crystal.hkl_data` / `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing Simulator)
If Blocked: Capture stdout/stderr to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempts/<timestamp>/, log the blocker under CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempt History, and stash the latest harness snapshot in notes.md before touching normalization code.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:458-476,482-492 — Phase L2b remains open because the harness never sets `Crystal.hkl_data`; fix_plan now cites harness_hkl_state.txt as proof.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:12-20,243 — L2b guidance updated today: consume `(F_grid, metadata)` and attach them directly to the Crystal before rerunning the trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state.txt — Evidence that `crystal.hkl_data is None` after the current harness path.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:1-35 — Shows `F_cell=0`/`I_before_scaling=0` despite hkl=(1,12,3), confirming the metadata bug.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:55-88 — Reference for MOSFLM orientation semantics you must preserve while touching the harness.

How-To Map:
- Patch reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py so the HKL read writes `crystal.hkl_data = F_grid_tensor` and `crystal.hkl_metadata = hkl_metadata` (alternatively call `crystal.load_hkl(...)` on the same path); ensure metadata dict stays on the correct device/dtype.
- Keep the MOSFLM vector assignments introduced last loop and re-run the harness via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor` from the repo root.
- Update reports/…/harness_hkl_state.txt with a quick post-fix probe (reuse the python snippet but now expect `hkl_data is None? False`).
- Archive refreshed env + notes: overwrite trace_py_env.json and append key observations to notes.md; stash the old trace under a timestamped subdir if you want to diff later.
- Validate selector discovery via `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`, then run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c-log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py-log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md` to refresh L2c.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave `crystal.hkl_data` unset; structure factors will revert to default_F=0.
- Keep tensors device/dtype-neutral—no `.cpu()` or implicit host copies in the harness.
- Preserve MOSFLM vector assignments and the SAMPLE pivot; orientation regression will break pix0 parity.
- Always set `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before importing torch or running harness/test commands.
- Do not overwrite trace_py_fullrun.log; it remains the pre-fix regression artifact.
- No production simulator edits this loop—focus on harness wiring only.
- Avoid running the entire pytest suite; stick to the targeted selector after verifying collection.
- Respect Protected Assets (docs/index.md) when moving or deleting files.
- Keep ROI pixel (685,1039) unchanged so comparison tooling aligns with the C trace.
- Update notes.md with context; future audits rely on that log.

Pointers:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:170-250 — HKL load + Simulator wiring that needs the metadata assignment.
- docs/fix_plan.md:458-494 — CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions and fresh Attempt #73 summary.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:15-20,243 — L2b checklist reflecting today’s blocker.

Summary: Wire the scaling harness into the HKL grid so TRACE_PY sees real structure factors and rerun the L2b comparison.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_env.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/notes.md, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b) → KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor (after updating the harness to attach "'`crystal.hkl_data` / `crystal.hkl_metadata` before constructing Simulator)
If Blocked: Capture stdout/stderr to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/attempts/<timestamp>/, log the blocker under CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempt History, and stash the latest harness snapshot in notes.md before touching normalization code.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:458-476,482-492 — Phase L2b remains open because the harness never sets `Crystal.hkl_data`; fix_plan now cites harness_hkl_state.txt as proof.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:12-20,243 — L2b guidance updated today: consume `(F_grid, metadata)` and attach them directly to the Crystal before rerunning the trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state.txt — Evidence that `crystal.hkl_data is None` after the current harness path.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:1-35 — Shows `F_cell=0`/`I_before_scaling=0` despite hkl=(1,12,3), confirming the metadata bug.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:55-88 — Reference for MOSFLM orientation semantics you must preserve while touching the harness.

How-To Map:
- Patch reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py so the HKL read writes `crystal.hkl_data = F_grid_tensor` and `crystal.hkl_metadata = hkl_metadata` (alternatively call `crystal.load_hkl(...)` on the same path); ensure metadata dict stays on the correct device/dtype.
- Keep the MOSFLM vector assignments introduced last loop and re-run the harness via `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor` from the repo root.
- Update reports/…/harness_hkl_state.txt with a quick post-fix probe (reuse the python snippet but now expect `hkl_data is None? False`).
- Archive refreshed env + notes: overwrite trace_py_env.json and append key observations to notes.md; stash the old trace under a timestamped subdir if you want to diff later.
- Validate selector discovery via `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`, then run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c-log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py-log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md` to refresh L2c.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave `crystal.hkl_data` unset; structure factors will revert to default_F=0.
- Keep tensors device/dtype-neutral—no `.cpu()` or implicit host copies in the harness.
- Preserve MOSFLM vector assignments and the SAMPLE pivot; orientation regression will break pix0 parity.
- Always set `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before importing torch or running harness/test commands.
- Do not overwrite trace_py_fullrun.log; it remains the pre-fix regression artifact.
- No production simulator edits this loop—focus on harness wiring only.
- Avoid running the entire pytest suite; stick to the targeted selector after verifying collection.
- Respect Protected Assets (docs/index.md) when moving or deleting files.
- Keep ROI pixel (685,1039) unchanged so comparison tooling aligns with the C trace.
- Update notes.md with context; future audits rely on that log.

Pointers:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:170-250 — HKL load + Simulator wiring that needs the metadata assignment.
- docs/fix_plan.md:458-494 — CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions and fresh Attempt #73 summary.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:15-20,243 — L2b checklist reflecting today’s blocker.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-200 — Tool you must rerun after the harness fix.
- src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:98-210 — Shows `hkl_data`/`hkl_metadata` fields consulted by `get_structure_factor`.

Next Up: If everything passes quickly, move to Phase L3 prep by documenting the first non-zero divergence from the refreshed scaling audit.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborts before capturing TRACE_PY because `read_hkl_file` now returns `(F_grid, metadata)`; `trace_harness.py` still expects the legacy seven-value tuple. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_fullrun.log` for the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` stack trace. As a result `trace_py_scaling_refreshed.log` still contains placeholder values (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`), keeping Phase L2b open until the harness adopts the new API and records live physics data again.
+- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 confirms the harness still leaves `Crystal.hkl_data` / `hkl_metadata` unset after loading scaled.hkl, so structure factors default to 0 and `F_cell` stays zero. Phase L2b remains open until the HKL grid/metadata are attached before calling `Simulator`.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborts before capturing TRACE_PY because `read_hkl_file` now returns `(F_grid, metadata)`; `trace_harness.py` still expects the legacy seven-value tuple. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_fullrun.log` for the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` stack trace. As a result `trace_py_scaling_refreshed.log` still contains placeholder values (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`), keeping Phase L2b open until the harness adopts the new API and records live physics data again.
+- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 confirms the harness still leaves `Crystal.hkl_data` / `hkl_metadata` unset after loading scaled.hkl, so structure factors default to 0 and `F_cell` stays zero. Phase L2b remains open until the HKL grid/metadata are attached before calling `Simulator`.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

 ### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation


[2025-10-07T05:53:41] thinking

**Preparing detailed debug summary**
[2025-10-07T05:53:41] codex

**Debug Findings**
- Harness never sets `Crystal.hkl_data`/`hkl_metadata`, so structure-factor lookup falls back to `default_F=0`, keeping `F_cell=0` and zeroing the scaling chain (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state.txt:1-5`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:1-35`). Confidence: high. Next confirming step: assign the grid/metadata directly in `trace_harness.py` (or call `crystal.load_hkl`) and rerun the supervisor trace to verify non-zero `F_cell`.
- The bogus integer-looking `scattering_vec_A_inv` values in the same trace log are consistent with that fallback path; once structure factors load, those rows should revert to sensible floats. No additional action until the HKL wiring is fixed.

**Repo Updates**
- Logged the blocker and required fix in `docs/fix_plan.md:458-498` (Attempt #73) and refreshed the Phase L2b guidance in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:12-20,243`.
- Captured the repro snippet output under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state.txt`.
- Replaced `input.md` with new marching orders directing Ralph to attach the HKL grid/metadata, rerun the harness command, refresh scaling artifacts, then re-run `compare_scaling_traces.py`.

**Next Steps for Ralph**
1. Patch the harness to set `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` (or reuse `crystal.load_hkl`) before constructing `Simulator`.
2. Re-run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --config supervisor`, update `harness_hkl_state.txt`, `trace_py_env.json`, and `notes.md`.
3. Validate collection with `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`, then regenerate `scaling_audit_summary.md` via `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`.

No tests were executed this loop.

+      - Fix: set `crystal.hkl_data = F_grid_tensor` and `crystal.hkl_metadata = hkl_metadata` (or call `crystal.load_hkl`) before creating `Simulator`.
+    Next Actions: Patch harness to attach HKL grid + metadata, rerun the L2b trace capture, update `scaling_audit_summary.md`, then resume L2c normalization analysis.
   * [2025-10-07] Attempt #69 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b harness refresh complete). **Updated trace harness to use live simulator TRACE_PY output; generated fresh trace_py_scaling.log with 40 real values.**
     Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured from stdout; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64).

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborts before capturing TRACE_PY because `read_hkl_file` now returns `(F_grid, metadata)`; `trace_harness.py` still expects the legacy seven-value tuple. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_fullrun.log` for the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack` stack trace. As a result `trace_py_scaling_refreshed.log` still contains placeholder values (`I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar 0`), keeping Phase L2b open until the harness adopts the new API and records live physics data again.
+- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 confirms the harness still leaves `Crystal.hkl_data` / `hkl_metadata` unset after loading scaled.hkl, so structure factors default to 0 and `F_cell` stays zero. Phase L2b remains open until the HKL grid/metadata are attached before calling `Simulator`.
 - Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

Refresh `trace_py_env.json`/`notes.md`, keep the failing `trace_py_fullrun.log` as evidence, then archive the successful rerun before proceeding to L2c. |
