this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan: Detector Geometry Correlation Issue

**Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Issue**: PyTorch vs C reference correlation = 0.040 (target > 0.999)  
**Status**: Critical - Blocking validation of detector geometry implementation  

## Executive Summary

Despite fixing C reference parameter bugs (-twotheta, -Xbeam/-Ybeam), the correlation between PyTorch and C implementations remains unacceptably low (0.040). The detector geometry appears correct (basis vectors match), suggesting the issue lies deeper in the simulation pipeline.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Know Works
- ✅ Baseline configuration (no tilt): 0.999 correlation
- ✅ Detector basis vectors: Identical between C and PyTorch
- ✅ pix0_vector calculation: Matches between implementations
- ✅ C parameter mapping: Fixed (-twotheta, -Xbeam/-Ybeam)

### What Fails
- ❌ Tilted configuration (twotheta=20°): 0.040 correlation

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Test collection: 35 tests collected successfully in 2.16s (test_cli_scaling_phi0.py + test_phi_carryover_mode.py). Documentation-only loop per input.md Mode: Docs.

- Status Snapshot (2025-12-02): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Phase E1 regression sweep finished (artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`); Phase E2–E3 remain open ahead of detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

**Evaluating multi-turn planning status**

I'm sorting through long-term goals and existing plans to decide if any updates or new plans are needed before choosing the next action, focusing on the status and coverage of current plans related to CLI tests, vectorization, bug fixes, and pyrefly checks. I'll dig into the relevant plan files to verify their currency and coverage.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-12-01 refresh): Spec baseline locked, opt-in parity shim landed (Attempts #120/#121), and the dtype sensitivity probe in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/` confirmed the Δk≈2.845e-05 plateau is inherent to the C carryover bug. Decision logged to relax the VG-1 tolerance for c-parity mode to |Δk| ≤ 5e-5; documentation/test updates (Phase C5/D) remain outstanding.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

The follow-up log contains `reading Fs from Fdump.bin`, demonstrating the implicit dependency.

**Relevant code:**
- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1297-1304` — attempts to open `Fdump.bin` whenever `-hkl` is absent.
- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2355-2368` — rehydrates the cached structure factors silently.

### C-PARITY-001 — φ=0 Uses Stale Crystal Vectors (Medium)
**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel's final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

**Assessing project goals and plans**

I’m reviewing the current status of long-term objectives around CLI parity, bug fixes, vectorization, and the pyrefly plan. I want to confirm if the spec remains stable, check existing plans for updates, and look for any missing or needed tasks by searching the active plans folder. This should help me align ongoing work with overall targets.

- Owner/Date: galph/2025-12-02
- Plan Reference: n/a — follow `prompts/pyrefly.md` (author plan if scope expands)
- Reproduction (PyTorch):
  * Static analysis: `pyrefly check src` from repo root; archive stdout/stderr + exit code to `reports/pyrefly/<YYYYMMDD>/pyrefly.log`.
  * Verification tests: Map future fixes to targeted pytest selectors; during supervisor evidence loops capture `pytest --collect-only -q <selector>` output.
- First Divergence (if known): Pyrefly has not been executed since the float32 migration; current lint violations are unknown, blocking targeted delegation.
- Next Actions (galph supervision):
1. **Verify prerequisites** — Confirm `pyproject.toml` exposes `[tool.pyrefly]` and `command -v pyrefly` succeeds. If unavailable, log a blocking Attempt with guidance (document install path or alternative linting strategy) without introducing new tools mid-loop.
2. **Run baseline scan** — Execute `pyrefly check src`, store logs and metadata under `reports/pyrefly/<date>/`, and summarise diagnostics (errors/warnings) in `summary.md` for traceability.
3. **Delegate fixes** — Update `input.md` and this entry with prioritized findings (rule, file, severity) plus mapped pytest selectors so Ralph can address them; record progress in Attempts.

# Pyrefly Static Analysis Loop (Run & Fix)

Purpose
- Execute a single, fast loop to run configured static analysis (pyrefly) over `src/`, fix a small set of high‑confidence issues, validate with targeted tests, and commit. Keeps changes minimal and portable.

Autonomy & Messaging
- Do not ask what to do; act on this prompt.
- Only two messages: a short preamble, then the final Loop Output checklist.
- One item per loop; keep the scope minimal and surgical.

Preconditions & Inputs
- Tooling must be configured in‑repo. If `pyrefly` is not installed/available or `[tool.pyrefly]` is missing in `pyproject.toml`, do not introduce new tools in this loop. Instead, record a TODO in `docs/fix_plan.md` with a proposed dev/CI integration and exit after docs update.
- Read these before executing:
  - `./docs/index.md`
  - `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (see §1.5 Loop Execution Notes)
  - `./docs/fix_plan.md` (active item must be set `in_progress`)
  - `./input.md` (if present) — prefer its Do Now while maintaining one‑item execution

Ground Rules
- No new tools: use `pyrefly` only if already configured/available.

## Context
- Initiative: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 — establish a repeatable static-analysis loop for "'`pyrefly` so we can triage violations and delegate fixes without blocking runtime work.
- Phase Goal: Produce a clear, timestamped baseline of pyrefly diagnostics, map them to fix-plan priorities, and hand Ralph a scoped backlog with authoritative commands and artifact locations.
- Dependencies: 
  - `prompts/pyrefly.md` — SOP for running the static-analysis loop.
  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §1.5 — testing cadence and command sourcing rules.
  - `docs/fix_plan.md` — active item ledger for logging attempts and delegations.
  - `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pyrefly]` — configuration guardrail (must remain untouched).
  - Environment availability of the `pyrefly` CLI (verify via `command -v pyrefly`).
- Artifact Policy: Store every run under `reports/pyrefly/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` with `commands.txt`, raw logs, `summary.md`, and `env.json`. Never commit these directories; reference them from fix_plan attempts.

### Phase A — Preconditions & Tool Audit
Goal: Confirm pyrefly is configured and document the command surface before any analysis run.
Prereqs: Clean git status (aside from known WIP), docs/index.md reread, fix_plan entry marked active.

| A3 | Log preconditions in fix plan | [ ] | Update `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt with tool availability status and pointer to this plan (Phase A). |

### Phase B — Baseline Scan Execution
Goal: Capture the first full pyrefly diagnostic run with reproducible metadata.
Prereqs: Phase A complete; ensure no prior pyrefly logs exist or archive them.
Exit Criteria: `pyrefly check src` output stored, environment captured, exit code documented.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Execute baseline run | [ ] | From repo root: `pyrefly check src | tee reports/pyrefly/<ts>/pyrefly.log`. Preserve exit status in `commands.txt`. |

| B3 | Summarise diagnostics | [ ] | Create `reports/pyrefly/<ts>/summary.md` listing violations grouped by rule/severity with file:line anchors. Highlight blockers (undefined names/import errors) vs style-only findings. |

### Phase C — Triage & Prioritisation
Goal: Translate raw diagnostics into actionable buckets for delegation.
Prereqs: Phase B artifacts complete.
Exit Criteria: Ranked list of issues with recommended handling recorded in both summary.md and fix_plan.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Classify findings | [ ] | Tag each issue as `blocker`, `high`, `medium`, or `defer`. Use pyrefly rule IDs and reason phrases. |
| C2 | Map to source owners/tests | [ ] | For each blocker/high item, identify likely module owner (e.g., detector, crystal, CLI) and candidate pytest selectors (validated via `pytest --collect-only`). Record in `summary.md`. |
| C3 | Update fix_plan attempts | [ ] | Append Attempt to `docs/fix_plan.md` with ranked findings, artifact paths, and recommended next steps (e.g., "delegate to Ralph in next input.md"). |

### Phase D — Delegation & Follow-up Hooks
Goal: Ensure Ralph receives precise execution guidance and that future loops can track progress.
Prereqs: Phase C triage complete.
Exit Criteria: `input.md` Do Now drafted, fix_plan next actions updated, and backlog references established.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Draft supervisor memo hooks | [ ] | In `input.md` (next supervisor run), reference this plan’s Phase B/C artifacts, provide exact `pyrefly` command, and enumerate top 1–2 findings to fix. |
| D2 | Update fix_plan next actions | [ ] | Under STATIC-PYREFLY-001, add bullet list of the immediate fixes to pursue (with rule IDs, file paths, and expected pytest selectors). |
| D3 | Schedule re-run criteria | [ ] | Define when to rerun pyrefly (e.g., after each fix batch or weekly). Document in fix_plan and `summary.md` to avoid redundant scans. |

### Phase E — Regression Tracking & Closure
Goal: Close the loop once violations are resolved or documented for future work.
Prereqs: At least one fix batch completed by Ralph; updated pyrefly run available.
Exit Criteria: Clean pyrefly report (or documented residuals) and archival notes ready for moving this plan to `plans/archive/`.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Validate post-fix scan | [ ] | After fixes land, rerun `pyrefly check src` and compare against baseline; store results under a new timestamped directory with diff summary. |
| E2 | Archive evidence | [ ] | Move stabilized artifacts to `reports/archive/pyrefly/<ts>/` and update fix_plan with closure metrics. |
| E3 | Retire plan | [ ] | When clean or residuals documented with roadmaps, mark this plan ready for archive and update docs/fix_plan.md status to `done`. |

| C1 | Classify findings | [ ] | Tag each issue as `blocker`, `high`, `medium`, or `defer`. Use pyrefly rule IDs and reason phrases. |
| C2 | Map to source owners/tests | [ ] | For each blocker/high item, identify likely module owner (e.g., detector, crystal, CLI) and candidate pytest selectors (validated via `pytest --collect-only`). Record in `summary.md`. |
| C3 | Update fix_plan attempts | [ ] | Append Attempt to `docs/fix_plan.md` with ranked findings, artifact paths, and recommended next steps (e.g., "delegate to Ralph in next input.md"). |

### Phase D — Delegation & Follow-up Hooks
Goal: Ensure Ralph receives precise execution guidance and that future loops can track progress.
Prereqs: Phase C triage complete.
Exit Criteria: `input.md` Do Now drafted, fix_plan next actions updated, and backlog references established.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Draft supervisor memo hooks | [ ] | In `input.md` (next supervisor run), reference this plan’s Phase B/C artifacts, provide exact `pyrefly` command, and enumerate top 1–2 findings to fix. |
| D2 | Update fix_plan next actions | [ ] | Under STATIC-PYREFLY-001, add bullet list of the immediate fixes to pursue (with rule IDs, file paths, and expected pytest selectors). |
| D3 | Schedule re-run criteria | [ ] | Define when to rerun pyrefly (e.g., after each fix batch or weekly). Document in fix_plan and `summary.md` to avoid redundant scans. |

### Phase E — Regression Tracking & Closure
Goal: Close the loop once violations are resolved or documented for future work.
Prereqs: At least one fix batch completed by Ralph; updated pyrefly run available.
Exit Criteria: Clean pyrefly report (or documented residuals) and archival notes ready for moving this plan to `plans/archive/`.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Validate post-fix scan | [ ] | After fixes land, rerun `pyrefly check src` and compare against baseline; store results under a new timestamped directory with diff summary. |
| E2 | Archive evidence | [ ] | Move stabilized artifacts to `reports/archive/pyrefly/<ts>/` and update fix_plan with closure metrics. |
| E3 | Retire plan | [ ] | When clean or residuals documented with roadmaps, mark this plan ready for archive and update docs/fix_plan.md status to `done`. |

## Context
- Initiative: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 — establish a repeatable static-analysis loop for `pyrefly` so we can triage violations and delegate fixes without blocking runtime work.
- Phase Goal: Produce a clear, timestamped baseline of pyrefly diagnostics, map them to fix-plan priorities, and hand Ralph a scoped backlog with authoritative commands and artifact locations.
- Dependencies: 
  - `prompts/pyrefly.md` — SOP for running the static-analysis loop.
  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §1.5 — testing cadence and command sourcing rules.
  - `docs/fix_plan.md` — active item ledger for logging attempts and delegations.
  - `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pyrefly]` — configuration guardrail (must remain untouched).
  - Environment availability of the `pyrefly` CLI (verify via `command -v pyrefly`).
- Artifact Policy: Store every run under `reports/pyrefly/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` with `commands.txt`, raw logs, `summary.md`, and `env.json`. Never commit these directories; reference them from fix_plan attempts.

### Phase A — Preconditions & Tool Audit
Goal: Confirm pyrefly is configured and document the command surface before any analysis run.
Prereqs: Clean git status (aside from known WIP), docs/index.md reread, fix_plan entry marked active.
Exit Criteria: Verified tool availability recorded, command plan captured, and reports directory prepared.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Verify configuration | [ ] | Run `rg -n "^\[tool\.pyrefly\]" pyproject.toml` and `pyrefly --version`. Record outputs in `reports/pyrefly/<ts>/commands.txt`. If missing, stop and add TODO to docs/fix_plan.md per prompts/pyrefly.md. |
| A2 | Prep artifact directory | [ ] | Create `reports/pyrefly/<ts>/` with skeleton files (`commands.txt`, `README.md` stub) so later runs stay consistent. |

Summary: Establish pyrefly supervision runway so static-analysis backlog can be delegated safely.
Mode: Docs
Focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 / Run pyrefly analysis and triage (docs/fix_plan.md)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/{commands.txt,summary.md,env.json,pyrefly.log}
Do Now: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase A (A1–A3). Run "'`rg -n "''^'"\\[tool\\.pyrefly\\]\" pyproject.toml"'`, `pyrefly --version`, and scaffold `reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/` with empty `commands.txt` + `README.md`; record outputs per plan.
If Blocked: Capture missing-tool diagnostics in `reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/commands.txt`, add a TODO to docs/fix_plan.md noting install prerequisites, then halt before running any linters.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — Item now in_progress; needs Phase A evidence before any baseline scan.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md — Phase A defines the exact pre-flight checks; follow state columns.
- prompts/pyrefly.md — SOP forbids new tool installs; confirms two-message cadence for future loops.
- pyproject.toml:11 — `[tool.pyrefly]` entry is the configuration guard we must verify.
How-To Map:
- Commands: `rg -n "''^'"\\[tool\\.pyrefly\\]\" pyproject.toml"'`; `pyrefly --version`.
- Artifact scaffold: `mkdir -p reports/pyrefly/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; touch `commands.txt` & `README.md` in that directory.
- Logging: Append the exact commands & outputs to `commands.txt`; note git SHA plus branch name.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not run `pyrefly check src` until Phase B.
- Keep reports under `reports/pyrefly/`; never commit logs.
- Leave `[tool.pyrefly]` untouched—configuration is canonical.
- No code edits or test runs this loop; documentation/evidence only.
- Respect Protected Assets; do not modify files listed in docs/index.md.
- Avoid creating multiple timestamp folders; stick to one per loop.
- Capture UTC timestamps for reproducibility.
- Record exit codes for every command executed.
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:2943 — STATIC-PYREFLY-001 overview and next actions.
- plans/active/static-pyrefly.md — Phase breakdown and checklist.
- prompts/pyrefly.md — Tool SOP and guardrails.
Next Up: Phase B (baseline `pyrefly check src` run) once Phase A evidence is logged.

**Finalizing Pyrefly plan message**
[2025-10-08T05:36:09] codex

**Pyrefly Plan**
- Authored `plans/active/static-pyrefly.md:1` defining Phases A–E for STATIC-PYREFLY-001 (tool audit → baseline scan → triage → delegation → closure) with checklist tables and artifact policy.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md:2943` to mark the item in_progress, reference the new plan, and align next actions with its phases.
- Refreshed `input.md:1` in Docs mode so Ralph tackles Phase A (verify `[tool.pyrefly]`, confirm `pyrefly --version`, scaffold `reports/pyrefly/<timestamp>/`).

Next Steps for Ralph:
1. Execute Phase A (A1–A3) exactly as outlined in `plans/active/static-pyrefly.md`.
2. Log outputs in the timestamped `reports/pyrefly/` folder and capture the status in a new fix_plan Attempt.

No tests were run this loop.
