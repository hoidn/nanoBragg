this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-27 refresh → galph loop i=118):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (parity shim evidence capture)** — Latest run (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/`) still plateaus at Δk≈2.845e-05. Follow the C4 diagnostic checklist in `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` (rows C4b–C4d): regenerate `per_phi_pytorch.json` via `scripts/trace_per_phi.py`, rerun `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` to refresh `delta_metrics.json`, and append a detector geometry comparison table to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`. Focus on removing the 2.85 µm `pix0_vector_meters` z-offset before rerunning shim traces, and continue to log pytest collect output + SHA256 hashes each iteration.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (dual-mode documentation/tests)** — After traces land, execute Phase C5 and Phase D1 of the parity-shim plan: update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md`, and related checklists to document the opt-in shim, and ensure collect-only evidence exists for both spec/parity selectors.
3. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #128 (galph loop — parity evidence) — Result: **EVIDENCE UPDATE** (Phase L3k.3c.4 diagnostics). **No tests executed** (analysis-only).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Spec alignment note (2025-11-26): `specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214` states φ sampling SHALL follow `phi = phi0 + phistep * tic` with no state carryover. Keep the C-side defect recorded in `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` (§C-PARITY-001) quarantined to parity harnesses; do not promote it to the normative spec or default PyTorch behavior. Track that `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1097-1198` currently caches `_phi_last_cache` to emulate C; the remediation plan must either remove or gate this behavior behind an explicit parity toggle once CLI validation is unblocked.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-23 PM): Attempt #109 regenerated the TRACE_C_PHI log under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/` and re-ran `compare_per_phi_traces.py`; Δk now measures 1.8116e-2 at φ_tic=0 while φ≥1 stay within 2.85e-5, confirming the carryover mismatch and leaving VG-1 blocked until the remediation lands.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-26): Attempts #111 and #113 produced per-φ traces with max Δk=2.845e-05. This still exceeds the VG-1 gate (Δk, Δb_y ≤ 1e-6). Treat those commits as partial progress until fresh traces prove the tighter tolerance.
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**

### C-PARITY-001 — φ=0 Uses Stale Crystal Vectors (Medium)
**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel’s final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

**Reproduction:**
```bash
./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg -cell 70 70 70 90 90 90 -default_F 1 -N 2 \
  -distance 100 -detpixels 4 -pixel 0.1 \
  -phi 0 -osc 0.09 -phisteps 10 -trace_pixel 0 0 \
  -floatfile /tmp/phi_float.bin -intfile /tmp/phi_int.img -noisefile /tmp/phi_noise.img \
  -nopgm -nonoise -noprogress > docs/bugs/artifacts/c-parity-001.txt
```
The trace (`docs/bugs/artifacts/c-parity-001.txt`) includes a single `TRACE_C: hkl_frac …` entry, regardless of φ step, confirming that the φ=0 pass reused the rotated vectors. Comparing successive pixels reveals identical `k_frac` values at φ=0 and the terminal φ step.

**Relevant code:**
- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3042-3059` — rotation only applied when `phi != 0.0`; no reset path exists.
- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2793-2807` — `ap/bp/cp` are captured by `firstprivate`, so stale state flows into the next pixel.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-11-30): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Parity/perf validation (Phase E) is the active gate before detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-11-27): Spec baseline locked (VG-1 met with ≤1e-6 deltas); parity shim not yet designed. Default path removes `_phi_last_cache`. Need explicit toggle plus regression coverage before L4 supervisor command rerun.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

**Reviewing plan accuracy and update needs**

I’m noticing the plan still lists a pix0 offset of 2.85 µm even though attempt #129 seems to have fixed it to about 0.033 µm. The plan likely needs updating to reflect this progress, especially for phase C4 tasks, but first I want to confirm the latest metrics and review fix_plan details around attempts #128-129 to see if Δk improvements justify a plan refresh. It feels important to sync the plan with the actual state before deciding next steps.

      - **C-parity mode functional:** Successfully reproduces C-PARITY-001 bug; all φ steps have consistent ~2.845e-05 drift
      - **Residual drift systematic:** The plateau pattern suggests numerical precision issue rather than logic bug
      - **Tests validate behavior:** Dual-mode tests (CPU+CUDA, float32+float64) pass; device/dtype neutrality confirmed
      - **VG-1 gate blocked:** Cannot meet ≤1e-6 without either (a) relaxing tolerance (supervisor decision), (b) regenerating C trace with TRACE_C_PHI, or (c) investigating precision paths (reciprocal recalc, rotation ops)
    Next Actions:
      1. Regenerate C trace with TRACE_C_PHI instrumentation to rule out staleness (per input.md:16-21)
      2. Profile reciprocal vector recomputation (cross products, V_actual division) to identify 2.8e-5 source
      3. Supervisor decision: Accept 2.8e-5 parity for validation purposes (relax VG-1), OR continue investigation

**Preparing plan update for parity shim**

I'm focusing on updating the plan document for the parity shim, specifically related to CLI-FLAGS-003 and recent fixes like attempt #129. I want to confirm the current plan is outdated, gather the latest metrics and task statuses, and identify relevant documentation to ensure the plan reflects the newest progress and needed next steps. I'll also consider setting the Mode to Docs since this is largely a documentation and planning update.

      - Crystal geometry regression suite: 49/49 passed (test_crystal_geometry.py + test_at_geo*.py)
    Observations/Hypotheses: Cache now respects device/dtype neutrality. Gradient flow preserved (torch.tensor() warning eliminated). The k_frac test failure is NOT a regression—it's the physics bug that Phase L3k.3c.3 is meant to expose and Phase L3k.3d will fix.

**Summarizing plan update requirements**

I’m organizing the updated plan around the new understanding that the residual Δk plateau stems from floating-point precision limits despite the pix0 fix. I’ll align the active `cli-phi-parity-shim` plan to reflect resolved pix0 offset tasks, update statuses, incorporate recent attempts like #127 onward, and revise next actions. I’m gathering relevant docs and noting key files to reference before restructuring the plan with clearer phases, task checklists, and updated instructions for next steps.

  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #13 — Result: supervisor audit (galph loop AS). Confirmed that current HEAD still averages multi-source intensities via `steps` (dividing by `source_weights.sum()`/`n_sources`) and applies polarization using only the primary source (`incident_dirs_batched[0]`) in both oversample and pixel-center paths (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:714-779, 879-944`). ROI mask reconstruction (`simulator.py:626-642`) and repeated `.to()` conversions on cached detector grids persist, so allocator churn remains a CPU bottleneck.

      - **Root cause of 2.845e-05 plateau identified**: Residual Δk originates from floating-point precision differences in the reciprocal vector recalculation chain (real → reciprocal → real → reciprocal per CLAUDE Rule #13). Y-component differences of ~1e-6 to ~5e-6 propagate through dot(S, b) to produce ~2.8e-05 deltas in k_frac.
      - **Hypothesis H1 (Likely)**: The plateau is within engineering tolerance for cross-platform float32/float64 parity (~0.005% relative error in k_frac ≈ -0.6) and represents unavoidable numerical precision differences in chained vector operations between C (double) and PyTorch (configurable dtype).
      - **Hypothesis H2 (Alternative)**: Relaxing VG-1 tolerance to Δk ≤ 5e-5 would accept current parity as sufficient for validation purposes.
      - **No production code changes beyond instrumentation**: Added TRACE_PY_PHI fields for diagnostics; no changes to physics calculation paths
      - Git SHA: 48a56d1 (commit at start of loop i=127)
    First Divergence: N/A — diagnostic instrumentation confirms expected behaviors; residual drift is floating-point artifact
    Next Actions:
      1. ✅ Phase L3k.3c.4 enhanced trace diagnostics COMPLETE — scattering vector, reciprocal vectors, V_actual captured

      3. → Recommended: Accept current tolerance, mark C4 [D], proceed to Phase C5 documentation (update diagnosis.md parity shim section, docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md shim availability note)

**Summarizing complex plan update strategy**

There's a lot here! I'm mapping out detailed plan changes for `cli-phi-parity-shim`: updating context to reflect recent instrumentation and pending tolerance decisions, restructuring Phase C with new diagnostic tasks replacing outdated ones, aligning the fix_plan's next actions, and preparing to script these edits since direct file commands aren't available. I want to carefully capture current states, new tasks (like float64 runs), and ensure all references and checklists are consistent with latest progress.

[2025-10-08T03:37:23] bash -lc "sed -n '1,80p' plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md" succeeded in 853ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-11-27): Spec baseline locked (VG-1 met with ≤1e-6 deltas); parity shim not yet designed. Default path removes `_phi_last_cache`. Need explicit toggle plus regression coverage before L4 supervisor command rerun.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

**Preparing detailed plan and checklist updates**

I'm outlining a thorough update to the C4 diagnostic table and related plan, including rewriting the current status, refreshing the C4 row to reflect new instrumentation evidence and pending tolerance decisions, and replacing the checklist tasks with a clearer focus on quantifying the floating-point precision plateau and syncing outcomes across docs and plans. I'll then script targeted file edits for these changes, ensuring instructions for running float64 sensitivity checks are clear but careful not to misstate environment variables or command options.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-10-08 refresh): Spec baseline locked and the opt-in parity shim landed (Attempts #120/#121). Enhanced traces from `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T023140Z/` show a c-parity Δk plateau ≈2.845e-05 attributed to floating-point roundoff; we still need a dtype-sensitivity probe and an explicit tolerance/remediation decision before Phase C5.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-27 refresh → galph loop i=118):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (parity shim evidence capture)** — Latest run (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/`) still plateaus at Δk≈2.845e-05. Follow the C4 diagnostic checklist in `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` (rows C4b–C4d): regenerate `per_phi_pytorch.json` via `scripts/trace_per_phi.py`, rerun `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` to refresh `delta_metrics.json`, and append a detector geometry comparison table to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`. Focus on removing the 2.85 µm `pix0_vector_meters` z-offset before rerunning shim traces, and continue to log pytest collect output + SHA256 hashes each iteration.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (dual-mode documentation/tests)** — After traces land, execute Phase C5 and Phase D1 of the parity-shim plan: update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md`, and related checklists to document the opt-in shim, and ensure collect-only evidence exists for both spec/parity selectors.
3. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #128 (galph loop — parity evidence) — Result: **EVIDENCE UPDATE** (Phase L3k.3c.4 diagnostics). **No tests executed** (analysis-only).
    Metrics: Evidence-only.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-10-08 refresh → galph loop i=118):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (precision diagnostics)** — Follow the updated C4 checklist in `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` (rows C4b–C4d): rerun `scripts/trace_per_phi.py` for spec and c-parity with float64 tensors, drop artifacts under a new timestamp, refresh `delta_metrics.json`, and decide whether the Δk≈2.845e-05 plateau should trigger a tolerance relaxation (Δk ≤5e-5) or additional remediation work.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (dual-mode documentation/tests)** — Once the tolerance decision is logged, execute Phase C5/D1 of the parity-shim plan: update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md`, and ensure collect-only evidence for both spec and c-parity selectors reflects the chosen mode.
3. **Phase L3k.3d** — With VG-1 unblocked, resume the nb-compare ROI parity sweep (VG-3/VG-4). Capture the refreshed `summary.json`/logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/nb_compare_phi_fix/`, then proceed through L3k.3e → L3k.4 before the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.

**Annotating historical attempts with supersession notes**

I’m planning to update the Observations in attempts #128 and #129 by adding bullet points that clarify these attempts have been superseded by attempt #127’s findings. This will help avoid confusion by explicitly noting that pix0 offset issues were resolved earlier and the current focus is on float precision. I’ll do this by inserting new lines into the existing bullet lists using Python code.

**Revising plan for dtype testing**

I'm examining how the default float64 dtype in the script affects our plan to test dtype sensitivity. Since the harness already uses float64, the original idea to force float64 may not reveal differences, so I’m considering updating the plan to test both float32 and float64 explicitly. This means modifying the plan entry C4b and the fix_plan next actions to instruct running `trace_per_phi` with both dtypes to clarify the impact on the plateau behavior.

**Planning test runs with dtype and phi-mode variations**

I’m figuring out how best to run the script harness with different dtype and phi-mode flags, leaning toward testing both spec and c-parity modes across float32 and float64 for completeness. I’ll also set up instructions for output paths in a timestamped directory and check prior runs for pixel values to ensure consistency. This way, the approach balances thorough data gathering with practical execution.

**Summarizing dtype sweep instructions**

I'm putting together detailed, step-by-step guidance for running dtype sweeps on the c-parity mode, including commands to run the harness for float32 and float64, how to compare results, handle environment and config snapshots, log commands, update diagnosis docs, note pitfalls, and mention fallback plans if issues arise. This will help the user systematically perform and document their experiments while maintaining consistency with existing plans and docs.

Summary: Capture float32 vs float64 φ-trace evidence so we can decide whether to relax the Δk tolerance or chase a precision fix.
Mode: Parity
Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — Phase L3k.3c.4 dtype sensitivity probe
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/trace_py_c_parity_float32_per_phi.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/trace_py_c_parity_float64_per_phi.json, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 (Phase L3k.3c.4) — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --phi-mode c-parity --dtype float32 --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/trace_py_c_parity_float32.log
If Blocked: If the harness errors because "'`scaled.hkl` or `A.mat` is missing, recreate them via the supervisor setup (see reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md) and rerun; record the failure + command in Attempts History before retrying.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md — C4b/C4d now demand explicit dtype sweep before tolerances move.
- docs/fix_plan.md:450 — Updated Next Actions call for float32/float64 evidence prior to VG-1 decision.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211 — Spec insists on fresh φ rotations; parity shim must stay opt-in and validated.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — C-PARITY-001 context ensures we keep the bug quarantined while measuring.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe && export BASE=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe

- (Optional sanity) repeat the harness for `--phi-mode spec` with float32 to ensure baseline stays aligned; keep outputs in ${BASE} with clear filenames.
- After each run copy metadata: cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_env.json ${BASE}/env_$(date +%H%M%S)_<dtype>_<mode>.json and cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/config_snapshot.json ${BASE}/config_<dtype>_<mode>.json before the next invocation overwrites them.
- For each new JSON under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/, run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py <json> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log > ${BASE}/compare_$(basename <json> .json).txt` and gather the generated comparison_summary.md/delta files into ${BASE}.
- Append a short subsection to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md (C4b) summarising float32 vs float64 Δk / ΔF_latt_b, and drop a commands.txt + sha256.txt in ${BASE} capturing every invocation and key artifacts.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit production code to change dtype defaults; use harness CLI / temporary wrappers only.
- Keep KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE on every run to avoid MKL crashes.
- Do not overwrite prior parity evidence—stage new outputs under the ${BASE} timestamp before copying metadata.
- Avoid moving or renaming assets listed in docs/index.md (Protected Assets rule).
- No full pytest runs; stick to the collect-only command above.
- Record precise commands in ${BASE}/commands.txt as you go to keep repeatability.
- Copy env/config snapshots before launching the next run, or the harness will clobber them.
- Maintain device neutrality: if you switch to CUDA, note it and capture a separate env file.
- Do not stage/commit temporary dtype patches; revert to clean state before finishing.
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md (Phase C4b/C4c guidance)
- docs/fix_plan.md:450 (current Next Actions for CLI-FLAGS-003)
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 (φ=0 carryover bug description)
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211 (normative φ rotation contract)
Next Up: After dtype evidence lands, update diagnosis.md + docs/fix_plan.md with the tolerance decision (Phase L3k.3c.4/C4c).

## 2025-12-01 (galph loop — dtype plateau probe setup)
- Refreshed "'`plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` to reflect post-Attempt #127 state: parity shim landed, pix0 parity confirmed, residual Δk≈2.845e-05 treated as precision issue; C4 checklist now targets float32/float64 sweeps (rows C4b–C4d).
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions for CLI-FLAGS-003 to point at the dtype sensitivity pass instead of the old pix0 offset work; annotated Attempts #128/#129 with notes that later evidence supersedes the pix0 focus.
- Issued `input.md` (Parity mode) directing Ralph to run `trace_harness.py` for supervisor pixel (685,1039) across float32/float64 c-parity runs, capture compare_per_phi outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/`, and append findings to `diagnosis.md` before making the VG-1 tolerance call.

**Composing final summary message**

I'll create a friendly, concise final message that highlights the updated plan, key file references with approximate line numbers, and important input instructions. I'll include a small bullet list summarizing the parity shim plan update, fix_plan adjustments, and dtype sweep inputs, along with suggested next steps based on the current progress.
[2025-10-08T03:43:33] codex

**Updates**
- Refreshed `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` so Phase C4 focuses on the floating-point Δk plateau; added new checklist items C4a–C4d covering float32/float64 sweeps and follow-up decisions.
- Repointed `docs/fix_plan.md:450` Next Actions at the dtype probe and annotated Attempts #128/#129 to note that pix0 parity is resolved while the precision drift remains.
- Issued `input.md` (Parity mode) directing Ralph to run `trace_harness.py` for pixel (685,1039) with explicit float32/float64 c-parity runs, capture `compare_per_phi_traces.py` outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/`, and log results in the diagnosis memo.
- Logged the loop in `galph_memory.md` so future supervisor turns know the dtype evidence is pending before VG-1 can close.

**Next Steps for Ralph**
- Follow `input.md` to execute the dtype sweep, copy env/config snapshots into the new report folder, run the comparison script for each JSON, and append a brief summary to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`. Once the data is in place, update `docs/fix_plan.md` with the measured Δk tolerance decision.
