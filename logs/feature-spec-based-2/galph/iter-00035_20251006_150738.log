review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-21): Phase H5b implementation reinstated the pix0 override for custom detector vectors (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md`); pending work is to refresh C precedence traces (H5a) and capture PyTorch parity logs (H5c) before resuming Phase K normalization tasks.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

**Analyzing F_latt discrepancy and codebase alignment**

I’m focusing on the F_latt calculation difference as the main cause of mismatch, planning to compare related C code, especially around line 694 of `nanoBragg.c`. I’m also reviewing project plans and status to align this deep code analysis with the user’s long-term goals of CLI parity and vectorization. I want to carefully gather debugging hypotheses and context before drawing conclusions.

**Outlining detailed investigation steps**

I’m mapping out a multi-step approach focused on deep analysis of the F_latt mismatch and vectorization progress, with hypotheses and triage for CLI parity issues, plus reviewing existing plans and docs. Before crafting a summary, I need to inspect the fix_plan details, especially related to CLI-FLAGS-003, and gather all relevant info for an informed next step.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-22): Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H5 before resuming normalization work:
  1. Refresh C precedence evidence (H5a): rerun the supervisor command with and without `-pix0_vector_mm`, stash logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-21/`, and update `phase_h5/c_precedence.md` to document that C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` when the override is supplied alongside custom vectors.
  2. Capture PyTorch traces with the reinstated override (H5c): extend/execute the Phase H trace harness so it logs `pix0_vector`, derived `Fbeam/Sbeam`, fractional h/k/l, and `F_latt` components. Archive outputs to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/` and append the C vs PyTorch deltas to `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`.
  3. Once geometry parity is verified, log the follow-up attempt in this entry (H5d) and then transition to Phase K normalization tasks.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_planning (Phase A evidence outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions:
  1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A1–A3: author the reusable `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `absorption_baseline.py` harnesses, capture pytest + timing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, and record Attempt #1 in this entry.
  2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
  3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * (pending) — Capture Phase A baseline artifacts and update this log.
- Risks/Assumptions: Must maintain differentiability (no `.item()`, no `torch.linspace` with tensor bounds), preserve device/dtype neutrality (CPU/CUDA parity), and obey Protected Assets rule (all new scripts under `scripts/benchmarks/`). Large tensor indexing may increase memory pressure; ensure ROI caching still works.
- Exit Criteria (quote thresholds from spec):
  * specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 tricubic acceptance tests run without warnings and match C parity within documented tolerances (corr≥0.9995, ≤1e-12 structural duality where applicable).

**Reviewing vector mismatch in Phase H3 and H5**

I'm comparing vector differences between pyro and C for pix0 and incident vectors around Phase H3 and later, noticing persistent mismatches despite earlier fixes. There seems to be regression or overriding issues in later phases causing geometry mismatches that affect scattering vectors and lattice forces. I'll dig into the fix_plan attempts, especially around attempt #21, to understand the root cause and confirm how C’s autop orientation factors in.

      - Device/dtype neutrality maintained via `.to()` coercion
    Next Actions: (1) Execute Phase G3 trace verification comparing PyTorch lattice vectors with C reference at supervisor command pixel; (2) Rerun Phase F3 parity command with MOSFLM orientation now wired through Crystal; (3) Document correlation metrics in `phase_g/parity_after_orientation_fix/`; (4) Update plan to mark G2 complete.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #18 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase G3 complete with transpose fix). **MOSFLM matrix transposed to match C column-major convention.**
    Metrics: Reciprocal vectors: perfect match (9/9 components exact to 16 decimals). Real vectors: close match (component[0] exact for all vectors, components [1],[2] within 0.05Å ~0.2% error). Miller indices: (2,2,-13) match after rounding. F_cell: 300.58 perfect match. Crystal geometry tests: 19/19 passed.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/io/mosflm.py:88` - Added `matrix = matrix.T` to transpose file reading
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log` - C reference trace (40 lines)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_py_fixed.log` - PyTorch trace with fix (49 lines)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation_fixed.md` - Complete trace comparison analysis
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_harness.py:89-92` - Updated to pass MOSFLM vectors to CrystalConfig
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Root Cause:** C code reads MOSFLM matrix in column-major order via `fscanf(infile,"%lg%lg%lg",a_star+1,b_star+1,c_star+1)` - each file row provides one component across all three vectors. Python's row-major `reshape(3,3)` interpreted it opposite way.
      - **Fix:** Transpose the matrix after reading from file (`matrix.T`) so Python extracts columns as vectors, matching C's extraction pattern.
      - **Verification:** All 9 reciprocal vector components now match C trace exactly (rot_a_star, rot_b_star, rot_c_star).
      - **Real Vector Deltas:** ~0.05Å differences in components [1],[2] are likely due to numerical precision (C double vs PyTorch float64 intermediate ops) and order-of-operations in cross products. These are acceptable for crystallography (<0.2% error).
      - **Miller Index Parity:** Now correctly compute (2,2,-13) vs previous wrong (6,7,-3). F_cell match confirms we're indexing the same reflection.
      - **Intensity Parity:** Still divergent (F_latt 35636 vs 62.68, I_pixel 446.25 vs 0.00356) due to lattice transform differences (Phase H) and missing polarization (Phase I).
    Next Actions: (1) Advance to Phase H lattice alignment to close the `hkl_frac`/`F_latt` gap before touching polarization; (2) Update Phase G3 status in plan to ✅; (3) Once lattice parity improves, transition to Phase I tasks I1–I3.
  * [2025-10-05] Attempt #19 (ralph loop i=20) — Result: evidence-only (Phase H1 complete). **Incident beam vector NOT flowing from detector config to simulator.**
    Metrics: C incident_vec = `[0.000513879, 0.0, -0.999999868]`; PyTorch incident_vec = `[1, 0, 0]` (MOSFLM default). Cascading failures: scattering vector completely wrong, Miller indices (23,44,-24) vs C (2,2,-13), F_latt 0.06 vs C 35636, final intensity 0.0 vs C 446.25.

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **sincg Hypothesis REJECTED:** Manual calculation proves `sincg(π*2.001203, 36) ≈ sincg(π*0.001203, 36)` (both produce ~35.889, matching C expected value)
      - **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Miller indices (h,k,l) themselves differ between C and PyTorch implementations
        - C trace: h=2.001, k=1.993, l=-12.991
        - PyTorch: h=2.098, k=2.017, l=-12.871 (from earlier grep)
        - All deltas exceed 1e-3 threshold (Phase H exit criteria violated)
      - **Upstream Problem:** Miller index calculation `h = q·a*` produces different results despite reciprocal vectors matching (Phase G3)
      - **New Suspects:** (1) Scattering vector calculation - H2 showed 0.06% difference (may be too loose); (2) Pixel position calculation - pix0_vector differs at mm scale; (3) Reciprocal vector rotation needs revalidation
      - F_latt sign/magnitude errors are **symptoms** not root cause - fixing Miller indices will resolve lattice factors
    Next Actions: (1) Compare latest PyTorch trace (trace_py_after_H3.log) with C trace to verify current Miller indices after H2 beam fix; (2) Trace backwards from Miller index calculation: review `h = q·a*` computation in simulator; (3) If scattering vector 0.06% delta is suspect, investigate `q = (k_out - k_in)/λ` calculation; (4) Check if pix0_vector difference needs addressing before lattice work; (5) No code changes until evidence gathering complete per Phase H3 mandate.
- Risks/Assumptions: Must keep pix0 override differentiable (no `.detach()` / `.cpu()`); ensure skipping noise does not regress AT-NOISE tests; confirm CUSTOM vectors remain normalised. PyTorch implementation will IMPROVE on C by properly converting mm->m for `_mm` flag. **Intensity scale difference is a symptom of incorrect geometry - fix geometry first, then revalidate scaling.**

**Evaluating parity discrepancies hypotheses**

I'm focusing on explaining why pixel zero parity might differ between pyro and C versions, considering geometry mismatches, incident beam vector differences, and float32 effects. I'll prioritize these hypotheses and plan to regenerate traces after applying overrides to clarify the cause. Next, I'll run Python code to perform a random choice as part of the process.

    override when custom detector vectors are present (override silently ignored).
    
    Metrics: WITH override: pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m
            WITHOUT override: pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m

    [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase J: Evidence - Identify first scaling divergence (I_before_scaling)
    
    Phase J Tasks Complete:
    - J1: Captured C and PyTorch scaling traces for pixel (1039,685)
    - J2: Created analyze_scaling.py to compute factor-by-factor ratios
    - J3: Updated docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #28 with findings
    
    Key Findings (Attempt #28):
    - First divergence: I_before_scaling (C=1.48e15, PyTorch=5.34e8, ratio=3.6e-7)
    - Root cause: F_latt calculation error
      * C: F_latt_a=35.9, F_latt_b=38.6, F_latt_c=25.7 → F_latt=35636
      * PyTorch: F_latt_a=-2.4, F_latt_b=11.8, F_latt_c=-2.7 → F_latt=76.9
      * 463× F_latt error squares to ~2e5× intensity gap
    - Secondary issues: polarization (C=0.9126 vs Py=1.0), omega minor delta
    - Steps, r_e², fluence all match exactly (normalization infrastructure correct)

    BeamConfig.polarization_factor now defaults to 1.0 to match nanoBragg.c:308
    polar=1.0 initialization. Previously defaulted to 0.0, causing polarization
    mismatch in Phase E traces (PyTorch 1.0 vs C ~0.9126 calculated Kahn factor).
    
    Changes:
    - src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483-487 — Updated default from 0.0 to 1.0
      with C reference citation
    - tests/test_cli_flags.py:591-675 — Added TestCLIPolarization class with

    Implemented nanoBragg.c lines 1851-1860 post-rotation geometry:
    - Compute newvector = (close_distance/r_factor)*beam_vector - pix0_vector
    - Extract Fbeam/Sbeam components via dot products with detector axes
    - Update distance_corrected = close_distance/r_factor
    
    Fixed test_cli_flags.py beam_center mapping bug:
    - Test incorrectly used MOSFLM convention (Fbeam=Ybeam, Sbeam=Xbeam)
    - CUSTOM convention with these vectors requires Fbeam=Xbeam, Sbeam=Ybeam
    - Updated expected pix0 values from fresh C trace
    
    Tightened test tolerance to 5e-5 m (50 μm) after verification:
    - pix0 parity achieved: C vs PyTorch deltas < 2e-8 m
    - X: 1.13e-9 m, Y: 1.22e-8 m, Z: 1.90e-9 m

**Assessing recent bridging commits**

I'm evaluating the latest commits related to road bridging to check for regressions or improvements. There are discrepancies around pix0 and task cancellations in fix_plan, so I'll verify if the current plan aligns with recent evidence—especially noting that some earlier conclusions about ignored overrides were reversed. I’ll also review the active plan file to confirm it properly reflects these updates and any remaining mismatches with pyro.

**Analyzing beam vector discrepancies**

I'm examining the mismatch between Pyro and C incident beam vectors and wondering if differences arise from coordinate system conventions or timing of the traces. I'll need to verify the Pyro and C traces from the same timeframes to clarify if the mismatch is genuine or from interpreting the beam direction differently, focusing especially on the Y component and any special incident_vec lines in the C trace.

**Evaluating need for plan updates**

I’m weighing whether the existing CLI parity and vectorization plans need updates due to new evidence and commits—especially around Phase H5 pix0 override and F_latt mismatch. I want to confirm if fix_plan entries reflect corrected override status and ensure no outdated cancellation notes remain. I’ll also identify relevant docs for the focus issue CLI-FLAGS-003 to prepare for final summary and potential plan refinements.

      - **Test Coverage:** Validates default matches C (1.0), -nopolar flag behavior, and -polar <value> override
      - **Phase I Tasks:** I1 (audit) ✅, I2 (implement) ✅; I3 (final parity sweep) remains pending
    Next Actions: Execute Phase I3 final parity sweep by running the supervisor command end-to-end (PyTorch CLI + C reference), stash logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/`, document polarization metrics in Attempt #27, then close CLI-FLAGS-003.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #29 (ralph loop) — Result: Phase H5a EVIDENCE-ONLY COMPLETE. **C-code pix0 override behavior with custom vectors documented.**
    Metrics: Evidence-only loop. Two C runs executed: WITH override (pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m) and WITHOUT override (pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m). Identical geometry values confirm override is ignored when custom vectors are present.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/with_override.log` - C run WITH -pix0_vector_mm flag
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/without_override.log` - C run WITHOUT -pix0_vector_mm flag
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/diff.log` - Diff showing only filename difference
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md` - Complete evidence report with precedence analysis
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Critical finding:** When custom detector vectors (`-odet_vector`, `-sdet_vector`, `-fdet_vector`) are supplied, C code computes pix0 from Xbeam/Ybeam and IGNORES `-pix0_vector_mm` override
      - **Geometry identical:** pix0_vector, Fbeam, Sbeam all match exactly between WITH/WITHOUT override runs
      - **Only diff:** Output filename (img.bin vs img_no_override.bin)
      - **Contradicts Attempt #23 (Phase H3b1):** Prior evidence suggested different Fbeam/Sbeam values; current evidence shows identical values

| H4c | Tighten regression test + targeted pytest | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #25: Updated regression tolerance to 5e-5 m (CPU and CUDA parametrised) and captured `pytest_h4c.log`; Attempt #25 logged in docs/fix_plan.md. |

### Phase H5 — Custom Vector Pix0 Override Reinstatement
Goal: Reconcile the newly observed 1.14 mm pix0 delta when both custom detector vectors and `-pix0_vector_mm` are supplied so PyTorch mirrors C’s override precedence.
Prereqs: Phase H4 artifacts available; Phase J scaling report (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`) pinpointing the divergence.
Exit Criteria: Detector traces with custom vectors show `pix0_vector`, `Fbeam`, and `Sbeam` matching C within 5e-5 m, and fractional h/k/l plus `F_latt_a/b/c` align within 1e-3 relative difference before resuming normalization work.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H5a | Verify C precedence with explicit derivation | [P] | Re-run the supervisor command twice (with and without `-pix0_vector_mm`) capturing fresh C traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-21/`. Update `phase_h5/c_precedence.md` to replace the 2025-10-06 conclusion (which stated the override was ignored) and document the dot-product derivation that now shows C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` from the override with custom vectors. |
| H5b | Restore pix0 override application in PyTorch custom-vector path | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-21 Attempt #29 (ralph). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` applies the override before projecting onto detector axes regardless of custom vectors; see `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` and regression log `pytest_regression.log` (57 passed). |
| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [ ] | Extend `phase_h/trace_harness.py` for Phase H5 to log `pix0_vector`, derived `Fbeam/Sbeam`, fractional h/k/l, and `F_latt` components with the new override path. Store outputs in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/` and append deltas (C vs PyTorch) to `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`. |
| H5d | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [ ] | After H5a/H5c align within 5e-5 m and 1e-3 relative error, record Attempt #29 closure in `docs/fix_plan.md` summarising restored override precedence and remaining Phase K normalization gaps. |

### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

     1	## Context
     2	- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
     3	- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
     4	- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
     5	- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
     6	- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
     7	- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-21): Phase H5b implementation reinstated the pix0 override for custom detector vectors (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md`); pending work is to refresh C precedence traces (H5a) and capture PyTorch parity logs (H5c) before resuming Phase K normalization tasks.
     8	- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Phase J traces still show PyTorch pix0 Y offset ~1.14 mm and `F_latt` ~7.69e1 vs C 3.56e4 because the 2025-10-06 precedence run captured stale geometry. H5a/H5c must refresh C/PyTorch traces to confirm override projection before entering Phase K.
     9	- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
    10	
    11	### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
    12	Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
    13	Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
    14	Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

**Preparing detailed input.md plan step**

I'm carefully organizing the Step 3.5 `input.md` for phase Evidence with focus CLI-FLAGS-003, making sure to cover instructions for running the C trace commands twice (with and without override) under appropriate environment variable setup, output paths, and documenting priorities, pitfalls, and fallback plans. I want to keep the length around 100-200 lines and follow the template, setting a clear Do Now line, how-to map, rationale bullets, and capturing what must happen without running tests per the phase.
[2025-10-06T15:20:45] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Capture fresh C traces to prove pix0 override precedence before touching PyTorch scaling.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / -nonoise & -pix0_vector_mm parity
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 H5a — run "'`NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` with the supervisor command (with and without `-pix0_vector_mm`) and tee stdout to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/{with_override,without_override}.log`; refresh `c_precedence.md` with the new dot-product derivation.
If Blocked: Capture at least the WITH-override run to `reports/.../c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override_attempt.log`, log the failure cause in c_precedence.md under a new "Attempts" heading.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:508-570 — Next actions demand H5a evidence before Phase K.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:1-35 — Plan context flags the 1.14 mm pix0 delta blocking normalization.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log:164-202 — Baseline C values to match (`F_latt` 3.56e4, polar 0.9126).
- docs/architecture/detector.md — Details pix0 projection math for custom vectors.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md — Canonical CLI semantics for `-pix0_vector_mm`.

How-To Map:
- Set env: `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` (instrumented binary).
- WITH override: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22` then `"$NB_C_BIN" -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`.
- WITHOUT override: rerun the same command without the `-pix0_vector_mm` triplet and tee to `without_override.log`.
- Diff check: `diff -u with_override.log without_override.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/diff.log` to confirm the geometry changes.
- Update findings: append vector dot-products and derived Fbeam/Sbeam to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md` (include numeric tables and conclusions).

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Don'"'t skip "'`NB_C_BIN` export; the root binary lacks instrumentation.
- No pytest runs this loop (Evidence gate).
- Keep outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/`; Protected Assets forbid ad-hoc dirs.
- Retain original CLI order; changing flag sequence alters precedence.
- Ensure logs capture full stdout/stderr; partial logs invalidate evidence.
- Avoid editing pix0 math yet—only capture evidence.
- Do not delete previous 2025-10-21 traces; archive new ones alongside them.
- Confirm commands run from repo root; relative paths assume cwd=/Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3.
- Respect device neutrality later—no temporary CPU-only tweaks in reports.
- Document units (meters vs mm) explicitly in c_precedence.md updates.

Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:7-33 — Phase H5 task definitions.
- docs/fix_plan.md:520-570 — Attempt #29 status and required follow-up.

**Planning document expansion**

I’m checking the current length of the input file and seeing it’s under the target 100–200 lines, so I’m thinking about ways to add more detailed content. To meet the length, I’ll consider expanding existing sections with extra bullet points and richer descriptions rather than just adding blank lines, aiming to keep the writing clear and informative.

**Planning detailed file expansion**

I’m figuring out how to rewrite the file to hit the 100-200 line target by adding more detailed multi-line explanations under each bullet and step. I’ll break down commands into smaller parts, add indented descriptions after each bullet in Priorities and Pitfalls while keeping the existing limits, and sprinkle extra clarifications after key sections to make everything richer and clearer. This way, I can regenerate a fuller version that meets the line requirements without changing the section order or bullet counts.

Summary: Capture fresh C traces to prove pix0 override precedence before touching PyTorch scaling.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / -nonoise & -pix0_vector_mm parity
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 H5a — run "'`NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` with the supervisor command (first WITH, then WITHOUT `-pix0_vector_mm`) and tee stdout to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/{with_override,without_override}.log`; refresh `c_precedence.md` with the new dot-product derivation.
If Blocked: Capture at least the WITH-override run to `reports/.../c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override_attempt.log`, log the failure cause plus environment in c_precedence.md under a new "Attempts" heading, and stop.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:508-570 — Next actions demand H5a evidence before Phase K resumes.
  Reasserts that normalization work is paused until pix0 override parity is proven with new traces.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:1-35 — Plan context flags the 1.14 mm pix0 delta blocking normalization.
  Highlights the new 2025-10-22 bullet noting stale C evidence and the need for refreshed logs.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log:164-202 — Baseline C values (`F_latt` 3.56e4, polar 0.9126) to match against future PyTorch traces.
  Use these numbers as the acceptance target when comparing PyTorch outputs in H5c.
- docs/architecture/detector.md — Details pix0 projection math for custom vectors so the dot-product derivation is documented verbatim.
  Cite the BEAM pivot equations when updating c_precedence.md to keep derivations authoritative.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md — Canonical CLI semantics for `-pix0_vector_mm`, including unit expectations for the override flag.
  Restate the spec text in the precedence memo to show compliance with the external contract.
- docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md — Required checklist before claiming detector parity; note the expectation on meter vs millimetre conversions.
  Reference its guidance on verifying Fbeam/Sbeam signs when you summarise the traces.

How-To Map:
1. Prep instrumentation
   - Run `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` from repo root to select the instrumented binary.
   - Ensure the binary still contains the TRACE_C printf hooks for pix0/Fbeam/Sbeam; rebuild if needed before running the command.
2. Create output directories
   - Execute `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22` to keep artifacts segregated by date.
   - Confirm the directory exists so later tee commands do not fail silently.
3. WITH override run
   - Invoke the supervisor command exactly as documented, including `-pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866`.
   - Command template:
     `"$NB_C_BIN" -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`.
   - Let the run complete; confirm the log contains TRACE_C lines for pix0, Fbeam, Sbeam, hkl, and F_latt.
4. WITHOUT override run
   - Repeat the command verbatim but remove the `-pix0_vector_mm` triplet (keep every other flag identical).
   - Tee output to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/without_override.log` for side-by-side comparison.
   - Verify the log still reports TRACE_C values; you should see geometry differences if the override is applied.
5. Diff and annotate
   - Run `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/without_override.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/diff.log`.
   - Inspect the diff to ensure Fbeam, Sbeam, pix0_vector, and hkl values differ; record precise deltas in the memo.
6. Update precedence memo
   - Append a new section to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md` summarising the two runs.
   - Include a table with pix0, Fbeam, Sbeam, F_latt, and hkl values plus the computed dot products (pix0 delta projected on fdet/sdet).
   - Document any surprises (e.g., if values still match identically) and flag for supervisor review before moving forward.
7. Housekeeping
   - Keep raw logs unedited; if redaction is necessary, duplicate the file first.
   - Note the git status after updates so the supervisor can diff the memo changes easily next loop.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Don'"'t skip "'`NB_C_BIN`; the root binary lacks TRACE_C outputs needed for precedence analysis.
  Using the wrong binary forces another evidence loop and wastes time.
- No pytest runs this loop (Evidence gate).
  Tests violate the Evidence-phase rule; stick to command-line traces only.
- Keep outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/`; Protected Assets forbid ad-hoc directories.
  Ensure nested directories use the 2025-10-22 stamp to avoid clobbering prior evidence.
- Retain the original CLI flag order; reordering may change precedence checks in nanoBragg.c.
  The goal is a faithful reproduction of the supervisor command, not experimentation.
- Ensure logs capture full stdout/stderr via `tee`; partial logs invalidate the evidence and make diffs useless.
  Double-check file sizes after each run.
- Avoid editing pix0 math or Detector code yet—this loop is evidence gathering only.
  Implementation changes belong to a later plan phase.
- Do not delete previous 2025-10-21 traces; archive new ones alongside them for comparison.
  Historical context is needed to explain the change in conclusions.
- Confirm commands run from repo root; relative paths assume cwd=/Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3.
  Running elsewhere will break path resolution for A.mat and scaled.hkl.
- Respect device neutrality when reporting later—no hard-coded CPU assumptions in notes.
  Mention device/dtype explicitly if relevant in observations.
- Document units (meters vs mm) explicitly in c_precedence.md updates.
  The spec expects clarity on unit conversions, especially for `_mm` overrides.

Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:7-121 — Phase H5 goal, exit criteria, and post-update guidance describing the stale C evidence.
  Follow the checklist so H5a is satisfied before PyTorch work resumes.
- docs/fix_plan.md:520-570 — Attempt #29 status plus supervisor note correcting the earlier "override ignored" assumption.
  Reference this when writing the precedence summary to show the misinterpretation was resolved.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md — Factor-by-factor breakdown identifying `F_latt` as the first divergence.
  Use its values to cross-check the C trace numbers you capture.
- docs/architecture/detector.md — BEAM pivot equations and projection rules for pix0 and beam center handling.
  Quote the relevant equation in your memo to tie the dot-product math back to the spec.
- docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md — Mandatory detector debugging checklist to confirm geometry evidence quality.
  Tick through its steps (units, axis orientation, pivot) while reviewing the new C logs.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md — CLI flag reference ensuring behaviour matches the normative spec.
  Point to the `pix0_vector_mm` paragraph when you justify the observed precedence.

Next Up: Phase H5c PyTorch trace capture and comparison once the C precedence evidence is logged and reviewed.

Summary: Capture fresh C traces to prove pix0 override precedence before touching PyTorch scaling.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / -nonoise & -pix0_vector_mm parity
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 H5a — run "'`NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` with the supervisor command (first WITH, then WITHOUT `-pix0_vector_mm`) and tee stdout to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/{with_override,without_override}.log`; refresh `c_precedence.md` with the new dot-product derivation.
If Blocked: Capture at least the WITH-override run to `reports/.../c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override_attempt.log`, log the failure cause plus environment in c_precedence.md under a new "Attempts" heading, and stop.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:508-570 — Next actions demand H5a evidence before Phase K resumes.
  Reasserts that normalization work is paused until pix0 override parity is proven with new traces.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:1-35 — Plan context flags the 1.14 mm pix0 delta blocking normalization.
  Highlights the new 2025-10-22 bullet noting stale C evidence and the need for refreshed logs.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log:164-202 — Baseline C values (`F_latt` 3.56e4, polar 0.9126) to match against future PyTorch traces.
  Use these numbers as the acceptance target when comparing PyTorch outputs in H5c.
- docs/architecture/detector.md — Details pix0 projection math for custom vectors so the dot-product derivation is documented verbatim.
  Cite the BEAM pivot equations when updating c_precedence.md to keep derivations authoritative.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md — Canonical CLI semantics for `-pix0_vector_mm`, including unit expectations for the override flag.
  Restate the spec text in the precedence memo to show compliance with the external contract.
- docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md — Required checklist before claiming detector parity; note the expectation on meter vs millimetre conversions.
  Reference its guidance on verifying Fbeam/Sbeam signs when you summarise the traces.

How-To Map:
1. Prep instrumentation
   - Run `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` from repo root to select the instrumented binary.
   - Ensure the binary still contains the TRACE_C printf hooks for pix0/Fbeam/Sbeam; rebuild if needed before running the command.
2. Create output directories
   - Execute `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22` to keep artifacts segregated by date.
   - Confirm the directory exists so later tee commands do not fail silently.
3. WITH override run
   - Invoke the supervisor command exactly as documented, including `-pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866`.
   - Command template:
     `"$NB_C_BIN" -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`.
   - Let the run complete; confirm the log contains TRACE_C lines for pix0, Fbeam, Sbeam, hkl, and F_latt.
4. WITHOUT override run
   - Repeat the command verbatim but remove the `-pix0_vector_mm` triplet (keep every other flag identical).
   - Tee output to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/without_override.log` for side-by-side comparison.
   - Verify the log still reports TRACE_C values; you should see geometry differences if the override is applied.
5. Diff and annotate
   - Run `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/without_override.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/diff.log`.
   - Inspect the diff to ensure Fbeam, Sbeam, pix0_vector, and hkl values differ; record precise deltas in the memo.
6. Update precedence memo
   - Append a new section to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence.md` summarising the two runs.
   - Include a table with pix0, Fbeam, Sbeam, F_latt, and hkl values plus the computed dot products (pix0 delta projected on fdet/sdet).
   - Document any surprises (e.g., if values still match identically) and flag for supervisor review before moving forward.
7. Housekeeping
   - Keep raw logs unedited; if redaction is necessary, duplicate the file first.
   - Note the git status after updates so the supervisor can diff the memo changes easily next loop.

## 2025-10-21 (galph loop — Phase H5 reopen)
- Phase J scaling traces revealed C honours `-pix0_vector_mm` even with custom detector vectors; PyTorch still skips override in that path → 1.14 mm pix0 delta, h/k/l drift, F_latt collapse.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` with Phase H5 (C evidence, override reinstatement, trace verification, fix_plan logging) and corrected the prior note that C ignored overrides.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to require H5a–H5c before Phase K; Attempt #28 observations now document the confirmed driver (missing override in custom-vector path).
- Regenerated `input.md` (Implementation phase) directing Ralph to execute Phase H5b with fresh C/PyTorch traces and targeted pytest.
- Follow-up: Expect Attempt #29 after override fix; pause Phase K normalization work until H5 parity evidence lands.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H5 evidence setup)
- Reviewed required guardrails (docs/index.md, specs/spec-a*, arch.md, config map, debugging guide, testing strategy, docs/fix_plan.md). Focus remains CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H5; vectorization plan untouched until parity lands.
- Confirmed plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md already tracks Phase H5a–H5d; no new plan needed. docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions (line 448) aligned with H5 checklist.
- Identified outstanding gap: need fresh C traces with and without -pix0_vector_mm to validate override precedence (Phase J evidence shows F_latt divergence from pix0 mismatch). Hypotheses logged in supervisor summary; implementation deferred until traces captured.
- input.md rewritten (Evidence phase) directing Ralph to run long-form C command twice and archive logs under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/, plus document derivation in c_precedence.md before touching PyTorch.
- No code/doc changes yet; awaiting H5a artifacts. Next follow-up: after Ralph captures traces, greenlight H5b override reapplication and revisit docs/fix_plan Attempt log.

## 2025-10-22 (galph loop — Phase H5 evidence refresh)
- Updated plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md: marked H5b [D], set H5a to [P] with new requirement to refresh C traces dated 2025-10-21, clarified H5c/H5d deliverables.
- docs/fix_plan.md now points Next Actions to C trace reruns + PyTorch parity capture; logged new Attempt #29 (2025-10-21) noting override reinstatement pending evidence.
- input.md reissued (Evidence phase) directing Ralph to run NB_C_BIN command with/without override, update c_precedence.md, extend Phase H harness for H5c, and archive outputs under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/.
- Next follow-up: Expect refreshed C logs in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-21/ plus PyTorch parity log; after evidence lands, revisit Phase K normalization tasks.

## 2025-10-23 (galph loop — H5a evidence push)
- Confirmed Phase J traces still show pix0 Y delta ~1.14 mm and "'`F_latt` 7.69e1 vs C 3.56e4 (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_py_scaling.log:1-27`, `trace_c_scaling.log:164-190`); geometry remains the blocker before normalization.
- Expanded `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context with a 2025-10-22 correction note and tightened H5c guidance to demand `F_latt` ≈3.5636e4 and pix0 <5e-5 m deltas before Phase K.
- Clarified `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #29 to mark the 2025-10-06 "override ignored" conclusion as instrumentation error so future loops do not rely on it.
- Reissued `input.md` (Evidence phase, 100 lines) instructing Ralph to rerun the C command with/without `-pix0_vector_mm`, store logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/`, diff them, and update `c_precedence.md` with dot-product derivations.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: deliver H5a (both C traces + precedence memo), keep prior logs untouched, then pause for supervisor review before starting H5c PyTorch traces.

**Preparing comprehensive final summary and commit**

I'm organizing a detailed final analysis with findings, ranked hypotheses supported by evidence, review of recent iterations, and plan updates referencing specific lines. I'll also include next steps and emphasize that the existing plan is updated but no new plan created. Before sharing the final message, I'll stage and commit all modifications to keep everything safe and consistent.

**Organizing final response structure**
[2025-10-06T15:25:08] codex

Narrowed today’s pass to the CLI-FLAGS parity blocker: surfaced the still-missing pix0 override evidence, refreshed the plan/fix_plan guidance, and left Ralph a 100-line evidence brief in `input.md`.

**Findings**
- PyTorch trace still shows pix0 Y offset ~1.14 mm and `F_latt` ≈7.69e1 versus C’s 3.56e4, explaining the 3.6e-7 `I_before_scaling` ratio (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_py_scaling.log:1-29`; `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_c_scaling.log:164-190`).
- Updated plan context now flags the stale 2025‑10‑06 C evidence and tightens H5 exit criteria before Phase K resumes (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:1-121`).
- Fix-plan Attempt #29 explicitly records the earlier “override ignored” conclusion as instrumentation error and keeps H5a/H5c in front of Phase K (`docs/fix_plan.md:520-523`).

**Hypotheses (ranked)**
- Pix0 override still misapplied with custom detector vectors (confidence: high). Evidence above shows geometry drift; confirming step: finish H5a/H5c by re-running the C command with/without `-pix0_vector_mm` and documenting the dot-product derivation.
- `sincg` float32 precision amplifies small `(h-h0)` deltas (confidence: medium). The C/Py traces diverge in h/k/l (`reports/.../trace_py_scaling.log:22` vs `trace_c_scaling.log:183`); confirming step: rerun the PyTorch trace in float64 once geometry aligns to see if F_latt converges.
- Polarization pipeline still defaults to unity despite the new config default (confidence: low). C trace reports 0.9126 (`trace_c_scaling.log:199`); confirming step: after geometry fix, trace PyTorch with polarization logging to ensure the Kahn factor flows.

**Ralph Review**
- Commit 6a0873b delivered the post-rotation beam-centre recomputation plus tighter regression tolerance—good scaffolding for current work.
- Commit e8146c2 aligning the polarization default with C was solid and landed tests.
- Commit 5878f16 prematurely declared the override ignored; glad we’ve now marked that conclusion as superseded in docs—please double-check instrumentation before closing future attempts.

**Plan & Direction**
- `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` now includes the 2025‑10‑22 correction and tighter H5c guidance; it remains the active roadmap for Goal #1.
- No new multi-turn plan needed; `plans/active/vectorization.md` stays on deck until CLI parity is proven.
- `input.md:1-100` is refreshed (Evidence phase) directing H5a: rerun the C command with both override settings, archive logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/`, diff them, and update `c_precedence.md`.

**Next Steps**
- Ralph: execute the H5a Do Now exactly as written, capture both C logs plus the diff, and update the precedence memo before touching PyTorch again.
- Supervisor follow-up after artifacts land: verify geometry convergence, then greenlight H5c PyTorch traces and revisit normalization (Phase K).
