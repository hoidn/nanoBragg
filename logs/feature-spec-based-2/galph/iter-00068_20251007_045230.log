review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor evidence mode (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Supervisor Evidence Gate (internal-only): No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Mode flags: Mode flags are combinable and refine execution; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

Callchain Tracing (Evidence Task)
- When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
- Directive: run `prompts/callchain.md` with a question‑driven invocation and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
- Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
  analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
  initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
  scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
  roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
  namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
  time_budget_minutes: 30
- Expected outputs:
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
  - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
- Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.

</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now

Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

**Outlining manual plan steps**

I’m creating a step-by-step mental plan since there’s no built-in planning tool, making sure to follow instructions carefully. The plan includes pulling updates, reviewing key docs, analyzing the issue with possible debugging, simulating decisions with code, updating plans and memory files, and committing changes if needed. Next, I’ll start by running the git pull command within a shell.

**Reading galph_memory**
[2025-10-07T04:53:03] exec bash -lc 'tail -n 60 galph_memory.md' in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-07T04:53:03] bash -lc 'tail -n 60 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 671ms:
- Hypotheses refined: (1) With padding fix, expect HKL parity to hit max |ΔF| ≤ 1e-6 once rerun; (2) if Δk≈6 persists afterward, capture fresh per-φ traces (Plan K3f/K3g) to isolate reciprocal-vector drift; (3) remaining intensity gap likely tied to sincg normalization order pending new evidence.
- Follow-up for Ralph: Execute L1d per memo, update docs/fix_plan Attempts with metrics, and prep Phase L2 scaling diagnostics if parity clears.

## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — Phase L2 kickoff)
- Coin flip landed heads; reviewed recent Ralph commits (`572217b`, `3e47b38`) — HKL padding/parity artifacts look solid, no regressions observed.
- Deep-dive into CLI parity status: scaling mismatch (sum_ratio≈1.26e5) still open; plan lacked Phase L coverage beyond L1. Vectorization initiative remains untouched pending CLI closure.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` with Phases L2–L4 (scaling audit → normalization fix → supervisor rerun) including checklist tasks and artifact targets under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to point Ralph at Phase L2a–L2c; authored new `input.md` instructing instrumentation + C trace capture for the scaling audit.
- Hypotheses (scaling divergence):
  1. Missing capture_fraction/omega application during oversample=1 path (Confidence: medium; C LOG shows capture_fraction=1 even when oversample flags off). Next confirming step: inspect TRACE_C vs TRACE_PY ordering once L2 traces exist.
  2. Misapplied steps divisor (possible double divide) leading to ×10 discrepancy that compounds with other factors (Confidence: low-medium). Next step: compare `steps` values logged in L2 traces.
  3. Fluence scaling mismatch (BeamConfig vs C computed area) causing ×~1.27e5 ratio (Confidence: medium-high, matches numeric magnitude). Next step: verify fluence logged from C vs PyTorch traces in L2a/L2b.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute new input.md focusing on Phase L2a; once traces captured, proceed through L2b/L2c before touching implementation.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase L2b trace directive)
- Synced cleanly; reviewed docs/index.md, specs/spec-a.md, arch.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md, debugging.md, testing_strategy.md, docs/fix_plan.md, and plans/active/* (CLI + vectorization) per SOP.
- Deep analysis: long-term Goal #1 still blocked in Phase L; C scaling trace captured (Attempt #55) but PyTorch trace missing. Goal #2 vectorization remains at Phase A with no artifacts.
- Hypotheses (CLI scaling mismatch):
  1. Missing capture_fraction logging/logic parity between C and PyTorch (confidence: medium; C trace shows capture=1.0, Py harness must confirm). Next step: complete L2b harness and compare capture terms.
  2. Potential omission of polarization factor in Py normalization (confidence: medium-low; previous phases reset default but need trace evidence). Next step: include polarization in Py trace and inspect delta vs C log.

- Next follow-up for Ralph: execute H6e (document pivot mismatch), update parity_summary + fix_plan Attempt log, then proceed to H6f implementation in a subsequent loop.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H6f pivot enforcement prep)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed CLI parity backlog vs long-term goal #1 and vectorization plan status (no edits required yet).
- Deep dive on pix0 gap: Phase H6 evidence confirms C forces SAMPLE pivot when custom vectors are supplied; PyTorch still defaults to BEAM. Normalization remains blocked until pivot + lattice parity close.
- Coin flip → heads: inspected Ralph’s last two commits (`5d0a34d`, `0b7eaf7`). Evidence quality is solid, but parity visuals landed in repo root (`img*_*.png`, `intimage*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) — flagged for relocation into reports before further work.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions for CLI-FLAGS-003 to mark H6e done, add H6f-prep cleanup, and call H6f/H6g/H6 progressions (Attempt #40 reserved for post-fix evidence).
- Issued new implementation memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to move the stray images under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, enforce SAMPLE pivot selection in `DetectorConfig`, add a targeted regression test, rerun focused pytest, and capture post-fix trace output for H6g.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute H6f per memo, log Attempt update + regression artifacts, then pause for supervisor review before H6g.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H6g evidence kickoff)
- `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` returned "Already up to date"; no conflicts encountered.
- Reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 entry (`docs/fix_plan.md:448-462`) and Phase H6 table (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145`); confirmed Attempt #40 landed pivot forcing but H6g artifacts remain outstanding.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context with Attempt #40 recap and marked H6f as `[D]`; rewrote H6g guidance to require post-fix trace + nb-compare artifacts under `reports/…/phase_h6/post_fix/` and to log Attempt #41.
- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so list now centers on H6g verification → K2 scaling-chain rerun → K3 regression test → Phase L gating.
- Coin flip → tails, so skipped historical commit audit; focused on evidence planning.
- Authored new `input.md` (Evidence phase) instructing Ralph to rerun the trace harness with pivot fix, capture diff vs C trace, compute deltas, run ROI nb-compare, and prepare Attempt #41 notes; memo also emphasises no pytest this loop.
- Key gap notes: normalization tasks K2/K3 still blocked pending H6g; vectorization plan untouched (Phase A baseline scripts outstanding).
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute H6g evidence capture, archive artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`, then log Attempt #41 in `docs/fix_plan.md` with measured |Δpix0| before touching normalization.

- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-06): Traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) show the SAMPLE pivot fix leaves residual close-distance deltas (~2.8 µm), which push the fractional Miller index from 2.0012 (C) to 1.9993 (PyTorch). Those 0.002 shifts around integer values amplify sincg results (F_latt_b ≈ +21.6%). Need dtype diagnostics to confirm float32 rounding vs geometry formula drift before coding a fix.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

**Preparing for in-depth analysis**

I'll pause on the large file for now and focus on gathering more context by reviewing `plans/active/vectorization.md` and related files, aiming to align with long-term goals before diving deeper into the fix_plan and main plan.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-09): Phase A remains untouched; no artifacts exist under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, so Ralph must prioritise A1–A3 baseline capture before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.

- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh):
  1. Phase L2b harness rerun — The trace harness (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py`) needs to be updated to invoke the simulator with `debug_config={'trace_pixel': [685, 1039]}` and capture stdout to a file, OR invoke via the CLI with proper flags. Current harness manually constructs TRACE_PY lines from API calls instead of using the simulator's built-in trace output added in Attempt #67.
  2. Phase L2c comparison — ✅ COMPLETE (Attempt #68). Comparison script created at `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`. Initial comparison shows polar=CRITICAL (0 vs 0.9146), I_before_scaling=MISSING, I_pixel_final=CRITICAL (0 vs 2.88e-7). Once fresh PyTorch trace is captured, rerun comparison and update `scaling_audit_summary.md`.
  3. Phase L3 prep — After L2c comparison with fresh data, identify the first divergent scaling factor and plan the fix. Likely candidates: polarization calculation (currently 0 in old trace vs 0.9146 in C) or normalization order.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #68 (ralph loop) — Result: **PARTIAL SUCCESS** (Phase L2c comparison tooling complete). **Created `compare_scaling_traces.py` script and executed initial comparison; identified that old PyTorch trace has stale placeholder values.**
    Metrics: Initial comparison shows 4 divergent factors (I_before_scaling=MISSING, polar=CRITICAL 0 vs 0.9146, cos_2theta=MISSING, I_pixel_final=CRITICAL 0 vs 2.88e-7). Perfect matches for r_e_sqr, fluence, steps, capture_fraction, omega_pixel.
    Artifacts:
      - `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1-252` - Phase L2c comparison script with detailed factor-by-factor analysis, percentage deltas, and status classification (MATCH/MINOR/DIVERGENT/CRITICAL/MISSING)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_comparison_initial.md` - Initial comparison results showing first divergence is I_before_scaling (MISSING due to placeholder)

# Phase L2b Scaling Audit Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Engineer:** Ralph (Loop i=64, evidence-only mode)
**Plan Reference:** `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L2b
**Task:** Compare C vs PyTorch scaling chain for pixel (685, 1039)

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Phase L2b COMPLETE:** PyTorch scaling trace successfully captured via CLI `-trace_pixel` flag.

**Key Finding:** Three major scaling factor divergences identified:
1. **Steps:** PyTorch=160 vs C=10 (16× factor from auto-oversample 4²)
2. **Fluence:** PyTorch=1.26e+29 vs C=1e+24 (~100,000× error)
3. **Polarization:** PyTorch=1.0 vs C=0.9146 (9.3% error)

**First Divergence:** Fluence calculation (5 orders of magnitude)

    AT-CLI-FLAGS-003 algorithms/numerics: Phase L2b instrumentation - real I_before_scaling from simulator internals
    
    Implemented Phase L2b instrumentation to expose actual accumulated intensity
    before normalization/scaling in TRACE_PY output, eliminating placeholder values.
    
    Implementation:
    - Saved I_before_normalization in both oversample (line 978) and no-oversample (line 1016) paths
    - Threaded I_before_normalization to _apply_debug_output (lines 1166-1178, 1189)
    - Modified trace extraction to use I_total tensor instead of recomputing (lines 1363-1368)
    - Preserved device/dtype neutrality via clone() operation
    
    Testing:
    - test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics: 4/4 variants pass
    - test_cli_flags.py: 31/31 pass
    - Total: 36/36 pass (0 fail, 0 skip)

**Evaluating harness trace capture and CLI parameter status**

I'm verifying that the harness still uses placeholders and hasn't consumed instrumentation yet, so I need to update it to capture real traces using debug_config as planned. I'll also review the compare_scaling_traces.py script to understand expectations. Regarding the CLI, I'm checking whether parameters like -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm are fully supported since scaling mismatches remain significant; I'll confirm their implementation status by inspecting the plan and code, and analyze logs like trace_py_after_133134.log to form new hypotheses.

    AT-CLI-FLAGS-003 algorithms/numerics: Phase L2b instrumentation - real I_before_scaling from simulator internals
    
    Implemented Phase L2b instrumentation to expose actual accumulated intensity
    before normalization/scaling in TRACE_PY output, eliminating placeholder values.
    
    Implementation:
    - Saved I_before_normalization in both oversample (line 978) and no-oversample (line 1016) paths
    - Threaded I_before_normalization to _apply_debug_output (lines 1166-1178, 1189)
    - Modified trace extraction to use I_total tensor instead of recomputing (lines 1363-1368)
    - Preserved device/dtype neutrality via clone() operation
    
    Testing:
    - test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics: 4/4 variants pass
    - test_cli_flags.py: 31/31 pass
    - Total: 36/36 pass (0 fail, 0 skip)

**Reviewing instrumentation and planning next steps**

I'm confirming the instrumentation correctly produces real trace outputs while noting the harness still needs updates to use the CLI for capturing `TRACE_PY`. I'll verify that the instrumentation hasn't affected restful behavior and check for any duplications or regressions from recent commits. Then I'll assess if the current plan requires revisions—especially for Phase L2—so that the harness updates and CLI tasks are properly integrated. Let's explore this thoroughly!

12:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
15:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
232:| L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [D] | ✅ Attempt #54 (2025-10-17): Regenerated C cache using supervisor command flags, achieved perfect HKL parity (max |ΔF|=0.0, 0 mismatches).

### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L2a | Instrument C scaling chain | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #55: Reused existing TRACE_C hooks (nanoBragg.c 3367-3382), captured `c_trace_scaling.log` for pixel (685,1039), and recorded setup in `instrumentation_notes.md`. Artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`; ready to mirror fields on the PyTorch side. |
| L2b | Expose and log PyTorch scaling factors | [ ] | *Pre-step complete (Attempt #66, 2025-11-12):* Harness now mirrors the supervisor command, and `trace_py_env.json` shows beam/flux/oversample flags plus `-nonoise`. *Step 1*: Patch `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` trace path (see `git blame` around 1193-1355) so `TRACE_PY` prints the **actual** per-pixel values from the live computation: reuse the polarization tensor returned by `_apply_polarization`, capture the post-absorption scalar from `_apply_detector_absorption`, and emit the full `steps` product (`sources × mosaic × φ × oversample²`) instead of bare `phi_steps`. Avoid recomputing placeholders; thread the tensors through the debug-config dict so gradient paths stay untouched. *Step 2*: Add a minimal regression test (e.g., `tests/test_trace_pixel.py::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`) that asserts the new trace reports C-matched values for a 1×1 ROI. *Step 3*: Once instrumentation is accurate, rerun the harness with the authoritative command, call Simulator with `trace_pixel=[685,1039]`, and persist stdout/JSON snapshots to `trace_py_scaling.log`, `trace_py_env.json`, and `notes.md`. |
| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [ ] | Build a comparison notebook or script (`compare_scaling_traces.py`) that aligns TRACE_C vs TRACE_PY lines and reports percentage deltas per factor. Summarize findings in `scaling_audit_summary.md`, explicitly calling out the earliest divergent term and hypothesized root cause. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #55 with key metrics. |

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L3a | Implement scaling fix in simulator | [ ] | Modify `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (likely around lines 930-1085) to mirror the C normalization order confirmed in L2. Include mandatory C-code quote per Rule #11. Ensure device/dtype neutrality (no `.cpu()`/`.item()` in differentiable paths). |
| L3b | Add targeted regression test | [ ] | Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a supervisor-command fixture that asserts PyTorch I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, and final intensity match pre-recorded C values within tolerances (≤1e-6 relative). Parametrise over CPU/CUDA when available. |

**Reviewing and updating plan based on progress**

I’m thinking about updating the plan to mark instrumentation and regression test steps as done while keeping the harness update pending. I want to restructure the plan to clearly separate completed and outstanding tasks, so there’s no confusion about what's done or still needed, especially for the CLI scaling project’s long-term goals. I also need to produce analysis and hypotheses around observed scaling mismatches before editing the plan or related docs.

# CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase K2: Scaling Chain Analysis Post SAMPLE-Pivot Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Commit:** 3d03af4f501f78462a626d15b04a955e5f839b8d
**Pixel:** (slow=1039, fast=685)

## Executive Summary

After implementing the SAMPLE-pivot fix in Phase H6, we regenerated PyTorch traces and recomputed scaling ratios. The analysis reveals:

- **Improved geometry:** F_latt_a and F_latt_c components now match C within ~3% error
- **Remaining blocker:** F_latt_b diverges by 21.6%, causing 25.5% error in total F_latt
- **Secondary issues:** Polarization factor still 1.0 in PyTorch vs 0.913 in C (9.6% error)
- **Final intensity:** 11.4% higher in PyTorch (497 vs 446) due to cascading errors

## Detailed Scaling Chain Analysis

### Perfect Matches (0% error)
- **F_cell:** 300.58 (both) ✅
- **steps:** 10 (both) ✅

I'm organizing a comprehensive plan for branch feature/spec-based-2 that includes artifact paths, a prioritized rationale list with file and line references, mapped tests verified by collection, and detailed "Do Now" commands combining harness refresh and test runs. I'll incorporate sections on pitfalls, how-to steps, pointers, and next tasks, aiming for about 120 lines total. Before drafting the input.md, I’ll gather precise line numbers from docs and plans using line numbering tools to ensure accurate references throughout.

   449	- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
   450	- Priority: High
   451	- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
   452	- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
   453	- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
   454	- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   455	  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   456	  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
   457	- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
   458	- Next Actions (2025-11-12 refresh):
   459	  1. Phase L2b harness refresh — Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to stream the simulator's live `TRACE_PY` output (`debug_config={'trace_pixel': [685, 1039]}`), regenerate `trace_py_scaling.log`, and capture updated `trace_py_env.json`/`notes.md` with non-placeholder values.
   460	  2. Phase L2c rerun — Re-execute `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` against the refreshed logs, update `scaling_audit_summary.md`, and record the earliest divergent factor in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.
   461	  3. Phase L3 prep — With real deltas in hand, outline the normalization fix scope (expected focus: polarization application order and F_latt mismatch) and queue targeted regression selectors.
   462	- Attempts History:
   463	  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #68 (ralph loop) — Result: **PARTIAL SUCCESS** (Phase L2c comparison tooling complete). **Created `compare_scaling_traces.py` script and executed initial comparison; identified that old PyTorch trace has stale placeholder values.**
   464	    Metrics: Initial comparison shows 4 divergent factors (I_before_scaling=MISSING, polar=CRITICAL 0 vs 0.9146, cos_2theta=MISSING, I_pixel_final=CRITICAL 0 vs 2.88e-7). Perfect matches for r_e_sqr, fluence, steps, capture_fraction, omega_pixel.

Summary: Refresh TRACE_PY harness to capture real scaling factors for supervisor pixel.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase L2b)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics (validated with --collect-only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/{trace_py_scaling.log,trace_py_env.json,notes.md}
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L2b — refresh trace harness; run "'`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --device cpu --dtype float32` then `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics -v`
If Blocked: Capture stdout/stderr from the harness run into `trace_py_stdout_cli.txt` and log the failure cause in `notes.md` with timestamp; do not patch simulator again—pause and notify galph in Attempts History.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-474 — current CLI-FLAGS-003 next actions demand a live TRACE_PY harness before normalization fixes.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:241-243 — Phase L2b/L2c guidance calls for replacing placeholder trace data and rerunning the comparison script.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log — shows placeholders; verifying replacement confirms progress.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:1-120 — ensures CLI flag semantics (-nonoise, flux/beamsize) remain aligned while updating harness inputs.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:1-120 — parallel trace SOP requires authentic logs for first-divergence analysis.
How-To Map:
- Fix harness: modify `trace_harness.py` so it instantiates `Simulator(..., debug_config={'"'trace_pixel': [685, 1039]})"'` and streams stdout into `trace_py_scaling.log`; prefer contextlib.redirect_stdout.
- Rerun harness: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --out trace_py_scaling.log --device cpu --dtype float32` (writes log + env snapshot); capture stderr separately if needed.
- Validate instrumentation: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics -v` (CPU/GPU parametrised); attach log to Attempts History.
- Prepare for comparison: once log is live, stage `trace_py_scaling.log`, `trace_py_env.json`, and update `notes.md` highlighting polar/omega/steps values.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not reintroduce manual TRACE_PY formatting; rely on simulator stdout to keep physics consistent.
- No `.cpu()` / `.numpy()` conversions when handling tensors; maintain device neutrality per runtime checklist.
- Keep Protected Assets intact (docs/index.md references); avoid moving files listed there.
- Do not rerun full pytest; stick to targeted selector above until code changes land.
- Avoid editing production physics while adjusting harness; this loop is evidence-only for CLI parity.
- Ensure harness uses supervisor flag set (beam_vector, flux, beamsize) to prevent automatic oversample changes.
- Capture environment metadata via existing JSON writer; do not introduce ad-hoc logging destinations.
- Maintain reproducibility: set `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` on every run interacting with torch.
- Archive outputs under the specified reports directory; no stray artifacts in repo root.
- Update Attempts History in docs/fix_plan.md after runs with metrics (steps, fluence, polar, I_before, final intensity).
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-461 — authoritative next steps for CLI-FLAGS-003.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:241-243 — detailed Phase L2 guidance.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/instrumentation_notes.md — harness expectations and required metadata snapshots.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py — ready for rerun once new TRACE_PY log exists.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:1-120 — reminder on targeted testing cadence and device checks.
Next Up:
- Rerun `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` with refreshed logs to populate `scaling_audit_summary.md`.
- Outline polarization fix scope in simulator once first divergence is confirmed.

**Preparing to update galph_memory.md and finalize commit review**

I’m getting ready to append a detailed summary to galph_memory.md that captures recent progress, key decisions, and next steps, including plan updates and follow-up actions. Before wrapping up, I’ll review the Step 2 commit results and git status to incorporate all relevant info into the final message.

- Deep analysis: CLI-FLAGS-003 still blocked because "'`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` fabricates TRACE_PY entries (see lines 252-281). Latest PyTorch trace with live instrumentation (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after_133134.log`) shows `hkl_frac≈(2,2,-12.99)` and `polar=1.0`, diverging sharply from C trace (`c_trace_scaling.log:265-287` reports `hkl_frac≈(-6.88,-0.607,-13.77)` and `polar=0.9146`).

- Hypotheses triage captured in supervisor summary; top issue remains reciprocal lattice mismatch (likely k-component) pending fresh harness data.
- Coin flip → heads; reviewed Ralph’s recent commits (`f130d19`, `1d2e6ac`, `bcd08b8`). Instrumentation patch clean (no regressions); harness fix partial (still placeholders); comparison tooling solid but awaits real data. No regressions spotted.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` L2b/L2c rows to mark simulator instrumentation/regression complete and call out the remaining harness rerun requirement. Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` next actions to center on harness refresh → comparison rerun → L3 prep.
- Authored new `input.md` instructing Ralph to stream live TRACE_PY output via `debug_config={'"'trace_pixel': [685,1039]}"'`, rerun the harness, and validate with the targeted trace test before proceeding to comparison.
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute L2b Step 3 (harness refresh + rerun), archive updated logs/env snapshots under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, run the trace regression selector, update Attempts History, then rerun `compare_scaling_traces.py` once real data exists.

Current harness manually constructs TRACE_PY lines from API calls instead of using the simulator's built-in trace output added in Attempt #67.

Initial comparison shows polar=CRITICAL (0 vs 0.9146), I_before_scaling=MISSING, I_pixel_final=CRITICAL (0 vs 2.88e-7).

[2025-10-07T04:58:44] codex

**Status**
- Brought CLI parity plan/current instructions back in sync: refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md:448-461` next-actions, updated Phase L2 rows in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:241-243`, rewrote supervisor memo `input.md:1-26`, and logged context in `galph_memory.md`.
- No tests run (supervisor evidence loop only).

**Analysis**
- Harness still fabricates TRACE_PY data (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:252-286`), so the scaling audit cannot surface real divergences.
- Live simulator trace (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after_133134.log:7-27`) shows `hkl_frac≈(2,2,-12.99)` and `polar=1.0`, while C reference (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log:265-287`) reports `hkl_frac≈(-6.88,-0.607,-13.77)` and `polar=0.9146`; mismatch persists beyond instrumentation.
- Vectorization initiative untouched; baseline capture in `plans/active/vectorization.md` still pending once CLI closes.

**Hypotheses**
1. Reciprocal lattice pipeline still diverges (high confidence). Evidence: HKL fractions differ by ~8–9 units between PyTorch and C traces (`trace_py_after_133134.log:7-10` vs `c_trace_scaling.log:265-270`). Next confirming step: after harness refresh, rerun `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` to confirm earliest divergence and quantify Δk (expected log: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md`).
2. Polarization path ignores Kahn factor (medium confidence). TRACE_PY reports `polar=1.0` even though C outputs 0.9146; likely per-source direction or default handling in `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` remains wrong. Next check: once real trace captured, inspect polarization values across devices via `tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics`.
3. Harness placeholder masks other scaling terms (medium-low). Until `trace_harness.py` streams simulator stdout, comparison script can’t validate I_before/omega/polar deltas. Confirm by rerunning harness with `debug_config={'trace_pixel': [685,1039]}` and verifying `trace_py_scaling.log` shows nonzero `I_pixel_final`.

**Ralph Review**
- Coin flip produced heads → inspected latest engineer commits. `f130d19` correctly threads `I_before_scaling` and polarization into TRACE_PY (no regressions detected). `1d2e6ac` fixed harness inputs but left placeholders; needs follow-up. `bcd08b8` delivered comparison tooling; ready once real data exists. Overall productive with clear next step (harness rerun).

**Planning**
- CLI parity plan now flags L2b as `[P]` with instrumentation done and harness rerun outstanding (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:241-243`); L2c marked `[P]` pending fresh data. Fix plan next actions updated to emphasize harness refresh → comparison → L3 scope (`docs/fix_plan.md:458-461`).

**Next Steps**
- Ralph: execute `input.md`—patch harness to emit live TRACE_PY output via `debug_config`, rerun command, record env/logs, then run the targeted trace test; update Attempt notes accordingly.
