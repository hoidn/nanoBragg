review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-17 parity refresh):
  1. Phase L3c harness audit — Mirror the probe attachment pattern inside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` (assign both `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata`) and capture a fresh `harness_hkl_state_*.txt`; while doing so, summarize the new probe findings in `analysis.md` so the evidence bundle is self-contained.
  2. Phase L3c CLI verification — Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL-loading path to ensure it applies the same tensor/metadata attachment and device handling as the harness; log results under `reports/.../structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md` before touching simulator internals.
  3. Phase L3d regression — Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) plus a supervisor-scaling expectation check (CPU/CUDA parametrised once the harness proves out).
  4. Phase L3e scaling validation — Enhance or author a `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` helper to diff TRACE_C/TRACE_PY after the HKL fix, storing metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` to document closure before parity.
  5. Phase L4 parity rerun — Execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics, confirm correlation ≥0.9995 + sum_ratio 0.99-1.01, archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-13] Attempt #71 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b validation + Phase L2c complete). **Harness already functional from Attempt #69; executed comparison script to identify first divergence.**
    Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Comparison identifies `I_before_scaling` as first divergent factor (C=943654.809, PyTorch=0, -100% delta).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

**Analyzing codebase for long-term goals**

I'll start by examining the codebase deeply to align with the long-term objectives, especially focusing on the aggregator environment and how test commands and plan vectorization work. I'll check relevant files like `docs/fix_plan.md` to understand current gaps and approaches, beginning with the VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 section for context.

## [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001] Vectorize tricubic interpolation and detector absorption
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure factor sampling), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, nanoBragg.c lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) and 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop).
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phase A1 complete; A2/A3 evidence outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-17 refresh):
 1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A2–A3: add the reusable `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `absorption_baseline.py` harnesses, capture timing artifacts (CPU and CUDA when available) plus `phase_a/env.json`, and update this entry when logs land. These harnesses remain the gating blocker before design work resumes.
 2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
 3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.
    Metrics: AT-STR-002: 3/3 tests passed in 2.12s (test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled, test_tricubic_out_of_bounds_fallback, test_auto_enable_interpolation). AT-ABS-001: 5/5 tests passed in 5.88s. Collection: 3 tricubic tests found.

Summary: Attach scaled.hkl into the scaling trace harness so TRACE_PY reports F_cell=190.27 for the supervisor pixel and the harness evidence matches the new probe run.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 – Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/collect_cli_scaling_20251117.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling_20251117.log, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3c harness audit — KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --pixel 685 1039 --device cpu --dtype float32 --out trace_py_scaling.log
If Blocked: Capture stdout/stderr to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness_failure_20251117.log, note the exception (command + stack) in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history for CLI-FLAGS-003, and stop before editing simulator or CLI code.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-463 records the refreshed next actions; L3c harness audit is explicitly the first todo after the probe success.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:249-261 promotes L3a to [D] and keeps L3c/L3d open until scaled.hkl is threaded through harness + CLI.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:60-120 defines the -hkl / Fdump precedence and -pix0_vector semantics that must remain correct when we change ingestion.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1-40 reiterates that HKL tensors must stay on the caller device/dtype; the harness should respect that contract.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe_20251117.log:1 proves F_cell=190.270004 already lives in scaled.hkl, so the harness must surface it without fallback hacks.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1 pinpoints `I_before_scaling` (F_cell=0) as the first divergence, so today’s evidence should replace that zero.
How-To Map:
- Ensure env vars are in place: export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE and confirm NB_C_BIN still points at golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg for later comparisons.
- Snapshot existing artifacts so the rerun diff is clean: cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling_pre_L3c.log; cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/config_snapshot.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/config_snapshot_pre_L3c.json; cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state_fixed.txt reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/harness_hkl_state_pre_L3c.txt (if the file exists).
- Run the harness command from repo root (see Do Now). Expect the run to emit TRACE_PY lines, config snapshot, env snapshot, and the final pixel intensity summary.
- Immediately promote the refreshed outputs to timestamped names so earlier evidence is preserved:

**Evaluating next planning steps**

I’m assessing whether a new plan is needed after completing the Do Now harness audit, focusing on CLI-FLAGS L3d tasks like verifying CLI behavior and HKL attachment. I’m also considering reviewing the vectorization plan in parallel by checking its active plan file.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-17): Phase A1 baseline evidence now exists under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (collect log, pytest logs, env.json). A2/A3 remain outstanding—no microbenchmark harnesses yet—so Ralph must prioritise creating the reusable scripts before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-17): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 continues to require the Phase A push (now narrowed to A2/A3). All guidance below assumes Ralph works from a clean editable install with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-06 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`, `.collect.log`, `test_at_abs_001.log`, `env.json`). Re-run only if dependencies change or new warnings appear. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |

| L3a | Verify structure-factor coverage for supervisor pixel | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-17 Attempt #77: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.py` recorded `probe_20251117.log` showing scaled.hkl returns `F_cell=190.270004` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14). Keep the log + timestamped copies alongside a brief summary in `analysis.md`, then proceed to L3c to thread the same attachment pattern through the harness/CLI path. |
| L3b | Reconcile HKL ingestion with C | [ ] | If the probe shows a mismatch (PyTorch 0 vs C 190.27), inspect the C reader (`nanoBragg.c:2333-2490`) to determine whether additional reflections are synthesized (e.g., via symmetry, padding, or sinc tables) despite the minimal HKL file. Document hypotheses and decide whether the harness must load the generated `Fdump.bin`, expand the HKL grid, or adjust interpolation flags before touching production code. Store notes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis.md`. |
| L3c | Implement scaling fix in simulator | [ ] | After L3a/L3b confirm the correct structure-factor source, modify `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (≈lines 930-1085) so the scaling chain mirrors the C ordering. Include mandatory C-code quotes per Rule #11 and keep the implementation vectorized/device-neutral. |
| L3d | Add targeted regression tests | [ ] | Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with (1) a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) using the agreed data source, and (2) a supervisor-command regression that checks I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, and final intensity against recorded C values within ≤1e-6 relative tolerance. Parametrise over CPU/CUDA when available. |
| L3e | Validate scaling via script | [ ] | Enhance `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_chain.py` (or create it if missing) to consume the L2 traces plus the new structure-factor data, emit JSON under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/metrics.json`, and fail loudly if any factor exceeds the agreed thresholds. |
| L3f | Update documentation & plans | [ ] | Refresh `docs/fix_plan.md` with the implementation attempt, link the new artifacts, and edit architectural docs (`docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`, `docs/development/testing_strategy.md`) to describe the final normalization + HKL ingestion flow. Mark L3 tasks `[D]` once artifacts are archived. |

### Phase L4 — Supervisor Command Parity Rerun
Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end parity for the supervisor command (correlation ≥ 0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px) and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
Prereqs: L3 validation artifacts show ≤1e-6 deltas for scaling factors; regression tests green.
Exit Criteria: nb-compare metrics meet thresholds, artifacts stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/supervisor_command_rerun/`, docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #56 documents the pass, and this plan is ready for archival.

**Reevaluating and updating plan**

The current plan seems outdated based on new evidence confirming ingestion and clarifying priorities. I'll focus on marking L3b as done, updating L3c to reflect CLI data attachment tasks rather than simulator fixes, and preparing a refreshed plan for CLI parity issues. To organize this complex update, I'll create a multi-step plan using the plan tool that covers reviewing docs, updating plans, and committing changes.

**Clarifying plan tool usage and planning steps**

I’m figuring out how to handle the “plan tool” since it’s mentioned but not clearly defined as an executable function. It seems I need to create and update a textual plan within analysis messages, especially for multi-step tasks, so I’m drafting a bullet-point plan with sequential steps to follow and plan to update it after completing subtasks.

**Revising plan phases and tasks**

I'm adjusting the plan to mark L3b as done since the ingestion reconciliation is complete, while clarifying that L3c focuses on auditing the CLI ingestion path without simulator changes. I want to reorganize the Phase L3 tasks to reflect current progress, update next actions accordingly, and note that initial info gathering is finished before moving on to documenting and summarizing.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L2a | Instrument C scaling chain | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #55: Reused existing TRACE_C hooks (nanoBragg.c 3367-3382), captured `c_trace_scaling.log` for pixel (685,1039), and recorded setup in `instrumentation_notes.md`. Artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`; ready to mirror fields on the PyTorch side. |
| L2b | Expose and log PyTorch scaling factors | [D] | ✅ Attempts #69, #72, and #74 (commits `1cf77b5`, `0f3de26`) now drive the harness through the updated HKL API, attach `crystal.hkl_data` / `crystal.hkl_metadata`, and capture live TRACE_PY output for pixel (685,1039). `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` shows real polarization/omega/steps, and `harness_hkl_state_fixed.txt` confirms the HKL tensor lives on the simulator device. |
| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [D] | ✅ Attempt #71 refreshed `scaling_audit_summary.md` via `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`, highlighting `I_before_scaling` as the first divergence (C=9.4365e5, Py=0) while all downstream scaling factors match within 2e-3%. This establishes that the remaining gap stems from missing structure-factor coverage rather than normalization math. |

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L3a | Verify structure-factor coverage for supervisor pixel | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-17 Attempt #77: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/probe.py` recorded `probe_20251117.log` showing scaled.hkl returns `F_cell=190.270004` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14). Keep the log + timestamped copies alongside a brief summary in `analysis.md`, then proceed to L3c to thread the same attachment pattern through the harness/CLI path. |
| L3b | Mirror probe attachment in harness | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-17 Attempt #78: `trace_harness.py` now assigns both `hkl_data` and `hkl_metadata` before simulator construction (see `trace_py_scaling_20251117.log`, `harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt`). Keeps harness behavior aligned with probe results and removes F_cell=0 divergence. |
| L3c | Audit CLI HKL loading path | [ ] | Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL ingestion to ensure it mirrors the harness pattern (attach both tensor + metadata, respect device/dtype). Document findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit.md` before any simulator edits. |

      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis_20251117.md` — Updated analysis with Phase L3c confirmation section
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Harness functional:** trace_harness.py lines 233-236 properly attach `crystal.hkl_data = F_grid_tensor` and `crystal.hkl_metadata = hkl_metadata` per Attempt #74 fix
      - **F_cell retrieval confirmed:** Structure factor lookup returns 190.27 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14), matching C reference within 4.27e-06 delta (≈0.000002%)
      - **Scaling chain operational:** Non-zero pixel intensity (2.38e-07) confirms proper scaling pipeline integration
      - **Metadata parity:** HKL grid ranges (h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30]) match probe findings exactly
      - **Phase L3a+L3c complete:** Both probe verification and harness audit demonstrate correct HKL loading; ready for CLI verification (L3d)
    Next Actions: Phase L3d CLI verification — Audit `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` HKL-loading path to ensure CLI follows the same `hkl_data`/`hkl_metadata` attachment pattern as the harness; document in `cli_hkl_audit.md` before proceeding to regression tests (L3d) and scaling validation (L3e).
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #72 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b harness MOSFLM orientation fix). **Corrected `trace_harness.py` to assign each MOSFLM reciprocal vector to its own config field instead of packing all three into `mosflm_a_star`.**
    Metrics: Harness now produces non-zero F_latt values (F_latt=1.351 vs previous 0), confirming proper orientation. Test suite passes 4/4 variants (tests/test_trace_pixel.py). Comparison script completed successfully (2 divergent factors identified).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py:159-161` - Fixed MOSFLM vector assignment (mosflm_a_star, mosflm_b_star, mosflm_c_star as separate tensors)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_audit_summary.md:1-76` - Updated L2c comparison report confirming first divergence at I_before_scaling
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` - Regenerated trace showing live polarization and omega values
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Fix confirmed:** Switching from `mosflm_a_star=[a*, b*, c*]` (list) to individual tensor assignments (mosflm_a_star=tensor(a*), mosflm_b_star=tensor(b*), mosflm_c_star=tensor(c*)) enables Crystal.compute_cell_tensors to use the MOSFLM orientation properly
      - **F_latt now non-zero:** Lattice shape factors are computed correctly (F_latt_a=-2.405, F_latt_b=-0.861, F_latt_c=0.652, product=1.351)
      - **F_cell still zero:** This is expected—pixel (685,1039) computes h=-7,k=-1,l=-14 but scaled.hkl only contains (1,12,3), so structure factor lookup correctly returns 0

**Adjusting insertion strategy for attempts list**

I’m tackling the issue of inserting a new attempt entry properly by targeting the `- Attempts History:` line and adding the new item right after to keep ordering consistent. Since the script previously aborted before writing changes, I’ll make sure the updated script handles both the Next Actions replacement and attempt insertion together and writes the file once at the end. Let’s try this improved approach!

- First Divergence (if known): `parse_and_validate_args` (src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:435) calls `read_hkl_file`/`try_load_hkl_or_fdump` without forwarding the parsed dtype, so HKL/Fdump data is always loaded as float32. When the CLI is run with `-dtype float64`, the simulator converts those float32 tensors to float64 later, permanently losing precision relative to the requested double-precision path and violating the DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 guarantee.
- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.

      - **Root cause remains configuration/loading:** The F_cell=0 divergence in trace_py_scaling.log stems from harness/CLI not loading/attaching HKL data, NOT from missing reflections or broken lookup logic

    Next Actions: Phase L3c harness audit per plan guidance (review trace_harness.py lines 206-236, compare against probe successful pattern, fix HKL attachment). NO simulator.py changes needed (scaling math correct per L2c, lookup logic works per L3a probe).

    Metrics: Evidence-only loop (no production code changed). Harness run successful: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured, F_cell=190.270004272461 retrieved, pixel intensity=2.38e-07. Test collection stable (2 tests in test_cli_scaling.py).
    Artifacts:

If Blocked: Capture stderr/stdout to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/cli_hkl_audit_failure.log and summarize the exception plus reproduction steps in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history before stopping.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:452-468 now points Phase L3 toward the CLI ingestion audit, so today’s work must produce that evidence bundle.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:270-283 lists L3c as the current open task, requiring documentation before code edits.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis_20251117.md:1-120 confirms the harness delivers F_cell=190.27; CLI must match this behavior next.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:60-140 defines -hkl / -floatfile precedence and forbids silent dtype/device coercion at the CLI boundary.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1-80 reiterates that HKL tensors must stay on the caller’s device/dtype, which the audit should verify.
How-To Map:
- mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor
- Run the Python audit command above; it dumps the parsed HKL tensor meta directly to cli_hkl_audit_raw.txt.
- jq '.' reports/.../cli_hkl_audit_raw.txt > reports/.../cli_hkl_audit.json (optional pretty copy). Extract key findings into cli_hkl_audit.md (dtype/device, min/max h/k/l, any gaps).

- Summarize findings (bullet list) in cli_hkl_audit.md citing the raw log, env snapshot, and any discrepancies; flag whether metadata keys (`h_min`, etc.) are present and if dtype/device align with expectations.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify src/nanobrag_torch code yet; today is evidence-only.
- Keep reports timestamped; never overwrite prior artifacts without copying first.
- Avoid using `.item()` or `.numpy()` inside audit scripts when tensors may require grad; stick to `.detach().cpu()` if needed.
- Maintain device neutrality in scripts (no hard-coded `.cpu()` conversions unless copying for logging outside simulator paths).
- Respect Protected Assets listed in docs/index.md; do not move/delete them.
- Stay on feature/spec-based-2; no rebases or merges mid-loop.
- Do not run nb-compare or the full parity suite until plan marks L3 complete.
- Capture env var `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every PyTorch invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- Avoid ad-hoc scripts outside reports/…; keep analysis local to plan directories.
- Document any anomalies in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts immediately.

**Correcting git SHA retrieval in environment snippet**

I want to fix how the env snippet captures the git SHA since the current method using `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` inside a Python string doesn’t work as intended. Instead, I’ll switch to using Python’s subprocess to run the git command directly and update the instructions and input.md accordingly to ensure the script runs from the repo root and outputs the SHA properly in JSON.

### Phase L4 — Supervisor Command Parity Rerun
Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end parity for the supervisor command (correlation ≥ 0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px) and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
Prereqs: L3 validation artifacts show ≤1e-6 deltas for scaling factors; regression tests green.
Exit Criteria: nb-compare metrics meet thresholds, artifacts stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/supervisor_command_rerun/`, docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #56 documents the pass, and this plan is ready for archival.

### Phase L — Supervisor Command Normalization
Goal: Isolate and resolve the 1.26×10⁵ intensity mismatch that persists when running the full supervisor command after Phase K fixes.
Prereqs: Phase K3g artifacts refreshed (Attempt #49), nb-compare data in `phase_k/f_latt_fix/post_fix/`, instrumentation from Phase J available.
Exit Criteria: Structure-factor grids, scaling chain, and final intensities match C within thresholds (|Δh|,|Δk|,|Δl| < 5e-4; sum_ratio 0.99–1.01; mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px); nb-compare rerun archived under `phase_l/supervisor_command/`; docs/fix_plan Attempt log updated; plan ready for archival.

Confirmed nanoBragg writes `(h_range+2)×(k_range+2)×(l_range+2)` voxels via `for(h0=0; h0<=h_range; h0++)` loops (see `nanoBragg.c:2400-2486`), leaving 9,534 zero-padded entries. PyTorch reader must drop the padded plane per axis. |
| L1c | Align PyTorch HKL cache reader/writer with confirmed layout | [D] | ✅ Attempt #53 (2025-10-17): Updated `src/nanobrag_torch/io/hkl.py` to honour `(range+1)` padding, added C-code docstring quotes per Rule #11, and introduced `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` (max |ΔF| = 0.0, mismatches = 0). |
| L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [D] | ✅ Attempt #54 (2025-10-17): Regenerated C cache using supervisor command flags, achieved perfect HKL parity (max |ΔF|=0.0, 0 mismatches). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/{Fdump_c_20251109.bin, summary_20251109.md, metrics_20251109.json}`. Phase L2 prerequisites now met—structure factors match C exactly. |

### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.

### Phase L4 — Supervisor Command Parity Rerun
Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end parity for the supervisor command (correlation ≥ 0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px) and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
Prereqs: L3 validation artifacts show ≤1e-6 deltas for scaling factors; regression tests green.
Exit Criteria: nb-compare metrics meet thresholds, artifacts stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/supervisor_command_rerun/`, docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #56 documents the pass, and this plan is ready for archival.

Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

| L2a | Instrument C scaling chain | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #55: Reused existing TRACE_C hooks (nanoBragg.c 3367-3382), captured `c_trace_scaling.log` for pixel (685,1039), and recorded setup in `instrumentation_notes.md`. Artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`; ready to mirror fields on the PyTorch side. |
| L2b | Expose and log PyTorch scaling factors | [D] | ✅ Attempts #69, #72, and #74 (commits `1cf77b5`, `0f3de26`) now drive the harness through the updated HKL API, attach `crystal.hkl_data` / `crystal.hkl_metadata`, and capture live TRACE_PY output for pixel (685,1039). `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log` shows real polarization/omega/steps, and `harness_hkl_state_fixed.txt` confirms the HKL tensor lives on the simulator device. |
| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [D] | ✅ Attempt #71 refreshed `scaling_audit_summary.md` via `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`, highlighting `I_before_scaling` as the first divergence (C=9.4365e5, Py=0) while all downstream scaling factors match within 2e-3%. This establishes that the remaining gap stems from missing structure-factor coverage rather than normalization math. |

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

Document hypotheses and decide whether the harness must load the generated `Fdump.bin`, expand the HKL grid, or adjust interpolation flags before touching production code.

| L3d | Add targeted regression tests | [ ] | Extend `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` with (1) a structure-factor lookup assertion for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) using the agreed data source, and (2) a supervisor-command regression that checks I_before_scaling, ω, polarization, and final intensity against recorded C values within ≤1e-6 relative tolerance. Parametrise over CPU/CUDA when available. |

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code. 
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

20:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
258:| L3b | Mirror probe attachment in harness | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-17 Attempt #78: `trace_harness.py` now assigns both `hkl_data` and `hkl_metadata` before simulator construction (see `trace_py_scaling_20251117.log`, `harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt`). Keeps harness behavior aligned with probe results and removes F_cell=0 divergence. |

**Summarizing final response details**

I'll organize a clear final message covering plan and fix_plan updates, new input instructions, and a documented list. I’ll also summarize findings from reviewing Ralph’s commits with the coin flip evaluation, mention staged plan files left uncommitted, and outline suggested next steps—all with friendly bullet points and relevant file path references for clarity.
[2025-10-07T07:44:48] codex

**Key Updates**
- Documented harness parity progression in `docs/fix_plan.md:448` (new Next Actions + Attempt #78) and aligned `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:20` Phase L3 to mark the harness task done while queuing the CLI ingestion audit.
- Rewrote `input.md` with a Parity-mode directive guiding Ralph through the L3c CLI audit command and artifact list; appended the corresponding supervisor note to `galph_memory.md`.
- Reviewed Ralph’s latest commits (`1a5c3e4`, `ed91218`): both were evidence-only loops that captured probe/harness outputs without code churn—good momentum toward closing L3.

**Docs Consulted**
- `specs/spec-a-cli.md` (CLI flag semantics for -hkl/-floatfile)
- `docs/architecture/detector.md` (pix0 & custom vector rules)
- `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md` (HKL device/dtype parity)
- `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (parity workflow guardrails)
- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/analysis_20251117.md` (latest harness findings)

**Next Steps for Ralph**
1. Execute the CLI ingestion audit per `input.md` (collect raw JSON + write `cli_hkl_audit.md`).
2. Summarize gaps in `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt history before moving to L3d regression work.

**Notes**
- Staged-but-uncommitted plan drafts `plans/active/oversample-thick-subpixel.md` and `plans/active/source-weight-normalization.md` remain untouched; leave them for their owners.
