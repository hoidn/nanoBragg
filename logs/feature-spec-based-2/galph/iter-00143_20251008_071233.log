this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.

do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

> Entries prior to 2025-11 have been moved to `archive/galph_memory/2025-09_to_2025-10.md` (summarized on 2025-12-04).

### Archived Summary (2025-09 → 2025-10)
- Established supervisor workflow, enforced prompts/debug.md routing, and opened initial parity/performance plans (AT-021 trace parity, AT-012 rotation, PERF-PYTORCH-004, REPO-HYGIENE-002).
- Diagnosed key issues: φ=0 carryover, metric duality regression (V_actual vs formula volume), pix0 override drift, torch.compile warm-up overhead, and float32 plateau fragmentation hurting peak matching.
- Captured repeated reminders on Protected Assets/dirty worktree hygiene and documented long-term goals (CLI parity restoration before vectorization, Dynamo cache validation, detector pivot rules).
- Logged recommended follow-ups: restore Core Rule #13 duality, regenerate parity traces, tighten test tolerances after fixes, and prioritize evidence artifacts under `reports/` for Ralph’s loops.

## 2025-11-06 (galph loop — K3d dtype evidence prep)
- Coin flip=heads → reviewed Ralph commits d150858, b73f0e2; work productive (Phase H1 evidence, Phase G3 orientation fix).
- Updated plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase H goal + tasks (H1 marked done; new H2 beam propagation, H3 lattice, H4 parity).
- docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions now call out H2–H4 sequence; reinforced beam-vector fix as first deliverable.
- Authored new input.md (Do Now: Phase H2 beam propagation + targeted pytest) and committed with message "SUPERVISOR: CLI H2 plan refresh - tests: not run".
- Working tree clean post-push (feature/spec-based-2 @ 35cd319).
 - Follow-up: Ralph to wire detector.beam_vector into Simulator, rerun beam trace, and land targeted pytest per input.md.
## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3 evidence prep)
- git sync clean (ba649f0). Reviewed required specs/arch/testing docs plus plans/active entries before analysis per SOP.

/home/ollie/.bash_profile: line 5: /home/ollie/.cargo/env: No such file or directory
- Reconfirmed spec mandate (`specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214`) that every φ step re-rotates the lattice and that C’s carryover bug is quarantined in `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204`.
- Noted PyTorch still mirrors the bug via `_phi_last_cache` (`src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1097-1198`); updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context to call this out and require a parity shim decision.
- Issued new `input.md` (Docs mode) directing Ralph to refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, log the attempt, cross-link the plan, and run the collect-only selector with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
- No tests run; repo clean after commit `10333c0`.

## 2025-10-07 22:16 UTC (galph loop — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 planning refresh)
- Rewrote `plans/active/vectorization.md` with phased structure (A–G) and explicit Phase D/F checklists; added D1–D4/D5 guidance and future absorption tasks.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md:2194-2210` Next Actions to align with the refreshed plan (Phase D1–D4 plus Phase E staging).
- Issued new `input.md` (Docs mode) directing Ralph to complete Phase D1 documentation, capture collect-only proof, and log tensor-shape/C-reference requirements.
- Follow-up: Ralph to author `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/polynomial_validation.md`, run collect-only selector, and prepare tap_points.md if needed before coding D2.


## 2025-11-27 (galph loop — φ rotation plan refresh)
- Rebased with origin (no conflicts) and reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 scope vs long-term goal #1.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` L3k.3c tasks: default path now mandates spec-compliant φ rotation (no `_phi_last_cache`), added new rows for parity shim design (L3k.3c.4) and dual-mode docs/tests (L3k.3c.5), preserved documentation row as L3k.3c.6.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to match the new gating order (spec fix → parity shim → docs/tests) and clarified historical attempt references.
- Issued fresh `input.md` (Parity mode) directing Ralph to implement L3k.3c.3, regenerate per-φ traces, and run the targeted φ parity tests; parity shim + doc refresh queued under Next Up.
- Commit `5eda539` pushed on `feature/spec-based-2`. No tests run in supervisor loop (planning only).
- Follow-up for Ralph: remove `_phi_last_cache` from the default rotation path, capture new Δk/Δb_y ≤1e-6 artifacts, then proceed to design the opt-in carryover shim per plan.

## 2025-10-08 04:33:06Z (galph loop)
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md CLI-FLAGS-003 next actions to focus on scaling audit tasks M1–M4 (trace harness + regression test).
- Issued Parity-mode input.md directing Ralph to capture new CPU scaling traces via trace_harness.py and compare_scaling_traces.py, storing artifacts under scaling_validation/.
- Outstanding follow-up: after CPU evidence, expand to CUDA trace and implement scaling fix + regression test per plan.

## 2025-12-03 (galph loop — CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 triage)
- Replayed scaling evidence from Attempt #137: PyTorch I_before_scaling is 21.9% low even though F_cell matches C.
- Diagnosis: trace_harness.py still instantiates CrystalConfig in spec mode; per-φ log (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T043438Z/trace_py_scaling_cpu_per_phi.log:1`) shows φ₀ F_latt=+1.379 vs C’s −2.383. Existing c-parity shim (`trace_py_c_parity_per_phi.log:1 (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi)`) reproduces the C values.
- Action for Ralph: add a `--phi-mode` override (default spec, parity run uses c-parity), rerun the harness + compare_scaling_traces.py, and capture new artifacts under `phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/` before moving to Phase M2.
- No other assets touched; docs/index.md remains authoritative.
## 2025-12-03 (galph loop — CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 evidence refresh)
- Updated `plans/active/vectorization.md` context to the 2025-12-02 snapshot and marked Phase E1 [D]; remaining work now tracks E2/E3 perf validation before detector absorption vectorization.
- Issued new Parity-mode input.md directing Ralph to rerun the scaling harness with `--phi-mode c-parity`, capture trace/summary/metrics under a fresh timestamp, and hold compare_scaling_traces tolerance at 1e-6 per Phase M1.
- Reinforced evidence-only expectations (no prod edits) and enumerated required artifacts (commands.txt, metrics.json, env.json, sha256.txt) so Phase M2 debugging starts with clean data; flagged follow-up for Phase M2/M3 and vectorization Phase E2/E3 once scaling parity stabilises.
## 2025-12-03 (galph loop — CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M instrumentation)
- Identified that the 8.7% `I_before_scaling` delta is purely an instrumentation mismatch: PyTorch logs the post-polarization value while the C trace logs pre-polarization. C value × polar reproduces the PyTorch number.
- Added debug memo `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` documenting the finding and the expected pre- vs post-polar values.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` (CLI-FLAGS-003 first divergence + Next Actions bullet) to call out the polarization offset and require trace tap updates before continuing Phase M.
- Issued Parity-mode `input.md` directing Ralph to emit both pre/post polarization trace lines, refresh the harness, rerun compare_scaling_traces, and keep evidence under a new timestamped directory.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

### Crystal Parameters

| C-CLI Flag | PyTorch Config Field | C Variable | Units/Convention | Critical Notes |
|------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| `-cell a b c al be ga` | `CrystalConfig.cell_a/b/c/alpha/beta/gamma` | `a[0], b[0], c[0], alpha, beta, gamma` | Å and degrees → radians | Must convert degrees to radians internally |

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 — unlock the supervisor parity command by aligning PyTorch CLI behavior with nanoBragg.c for `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm`.
- Current Objective: Finish the remaining φ=0 parity, scaling, and normalization work so the authoritative command below produces ≥0.9995 correlation, sum ratio 0.99–1.01, and ≤1 px mean peak distance.
  - Authoritative command (C + PyTorch parity harness):

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-12-02): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Phase E1 regression sweep finished (artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`); Phase E2–E3 remain open ahead of detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

The follow-up log contains `reading Fs from Fdump.bin`, demonstrating the implicit dependency.

**Relevant code:**
- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1297-1304` — attempts to open `Fdump.bin` whenever `-hkl` is absent.
- `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2355-2368` — rehydrates the cached structure factors silently.

### C-PARITY-001 — φ=0 Uses Stale Crystal Vectors (Medium)
**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel's final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
0. **Phase M0 instrumentation hygiene** — Guard the new tricubic neighborhood cache (plan tasks M0a–M0c) so debug tensors stay device/dtype neutral and do not leak giant batches. Log findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/instrumentation_audit.md` and append an Attempt before re-running traces.
1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
4. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (spec citation, bug ledger, fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before resuming full Phase M parity runs.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Test collection: 35 tests collected successfully in 2.16s (test_cli_scaling_phi0.py + test_phi_carryover_mode.py). Documentation-only loop per input.md Mode: Docs.

**Summarizing long-term goals and next steps**

I'm organizing notes on the main long-term goals like running the parity command with specific flags, confirming bug statuses, and tracking vectorization phases. Instrumentation guard is done, so the priority is scaling parity and verifying related tasks. I need to check plans and docs to confirm completed phases and outline remaining tasks before moving forward with the next evaluation step. I'll look into specific plan files to verify progress.

Prereqs: Phase L complete; instrumentation from commit 9a8c2f5 captured in trace harness.
Exit Criteria: Debug helpers guarded behind the trace flag, tensors allocated on caller device/dtype, and findings logged in fix_plan with artifact paths under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/`.

### Phase M — Structure-Factor & Normalization Parity (VG‑2)
Goal: Eliminate the `I_before_scaling` divergence by ensuring PyTorch fetches the same HKL amplitudes and lattice factors as C for the supervisor ROI pixels.
Prereqs: Phase L complete and Phase M0 instrumentation tasks marked [D] so traces/tests use aligned tolerances. Instrumentation from Phase L2b (`trace_harness.py`, simulator taps) already in place.
Exit Criteria: `trace_harness.py` comparisons show `F_cell`, `F_latt`, and `I_before_scaling` deltas ≤1e-6 relative, with artifacts under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`. Regression tests cover the fixed code path.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Audit HKL lookup parity | [ ] | Use `trace_harness.py` to log `hkl_frac`, integer HKL indices, and fetched amplitudes for pixel (685,1039). Compare against C trace (`c_trace_phi_20251123.log`). Store diff in `reports/.../scaling_validation/<timestamp>/hkldata.md`. Latest evidence: `20251008T055257Z` (spec, ΔI_before_scaling ≈ −14.6%) and refreshed c-parity run `20251008T060721Z` (Δ ≈ −0.21%) — see `manual_summary.md` for quantified F_latt deltas. `compare_scaling_traces.py` still crashes; manual metrics logged under the same directory. |

**Reviewing plan status and next steps**

I'm noticing that Phase M0 tasks still show as incomplete in the plan even though a recent commit marks them done, so I should update the plan accordingly. I'll also check the plan for the next steps on long-term goals, especially by examining the phi-parity-shim plan file to understand the status around the phi bug.
[2025-10-08T07:16:07] exec bash -lc "sed -n '1,160p' plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md" in /home/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg4/nanoBragg/.
[2025-10-08T07:16:07] bash -lc "sed -n '1,160p' plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md" succeeded in 7ms:
/home/ollie/.bash_profile: line 5: /home/ollie/.cargo/env: No such file or directory
## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-12-01 refresh): Spec baseline locked, opt-in parity shim landed (Attempts #120/#121), and the dtype sensitivity probe in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/` confirmed the Δk≈2.845e-05 plateau is inherent to the C carryover bug. Decision logged to relax the VG-1 tolerance for c-parity mode to |Δk| ≤ 5e-5; documentation/test updates (Phase C5/D) remain outstanding.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

      - Failed comparison command log (SIGKILL while invoking `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`); manual summaries generated via inline Python to unblock reporting.
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Spec mode mismatch confirms C’s φ=0 carryover bug is still the dominant delta; per-φ trace shows PyTorch `F_latt(φ₀)=+1.379` vs C `−2.383`, matching documentation that spec mode should not emulate the bug.
      - C-parity per-φ data now mirrors C’s sign pattern; residual 0.208% delta traces to φ₀ lattice amplitude drift (`F_latt` PyTorch −2.380134 vs C −2.383196, Δ≈3.1×10⁻³) while later φ steps align to <1e-3.
      - `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` exits via SIGKILL when run on the new traces (reproducible twice). Needs follow-up before Phase M2 automation resumes; manual metrics substitute for now.
      - Both runs executed with `dtype=float64`, `device=cpu` to decouple float32 rounding; confirms remaining error is algorithmic rather than precision noise.
    Next Actions:
      1. Diagnose `compare_scaling_traces.py` crash (likely unhandled trace schema edge case); restore scripted summary generation before the next engineer loop.
      2. Extend Phase M1 instrumentation to log per-φ `F_latt` deltas against C directly (e.g., capture absolute difference in manual metrics) so Phase M2 can target the φ₀ lattice mismatch.
      3. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 checklist with the new artifact timestamps and note that parity delta is down to 0.21% but still above ≤1e-6 gate.
      4. Hand off to Ralph: rerun the c-parity harness on CUDA once the script issue is fixed, then proceed with Phase M2 lattice-factor fix.
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #141 (galph loop — Phase M1 F_latt delta audit, Mode: Parity/Evidence) — Result: **EVIDENCE UPDATE** (manual comparison table + refreshed per-φ trace). **No code changes.**
    Metrics:
      - `I_before_scaling` PyTorch 941686.23598 vs C 943654.80924 ⇒ −0.2086% (Δ −1.97×10³); `I_pixel_final` mirrors the same drop (2.875383e-07 vs 2.881395e-07).
      - `F_latt` PyTorch −2.38013414214 vs C −2.38319665299 ⇒ +0.1285% relative; component deltas: F_latt_a +0.0819%, F_latt_b −0.0123%, F_latt_c −0.0344%.
      - Fractional h component drift: −1.4360×10⁻⁵ (relative +2.09×10⁻⁶); k/l differences remain at the 1e-5 level, matching prior harness output.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/trace_py_scaling.log` (44 TRACE_PY lines) with matching per-φ log/JSON copied to the same directory.
      - `reports/.../manual_summary.md`, `manual_metrics.json`, `commands.txt`, `sha256.txt`, `trace_py_env.json`, `config_snapshot.json` — SHA256 catalog updated after evidence capture.

**Reviewing and updating plans and next actions**

I’m reviewing the current Next Actions around the compare script and instrumentation guard, confirming they’re still relevant, and figuring out how to update the main plan and fix_plan docs to mark M0 tasks done. I’ll list key documents to reference, check alignment between Next Actions and the plan’s status, and prepare to update instructions for the next phase while also planning a commit once all info is gathered.

# Phase M0 Instrumentation Hygiene Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-08T07:05:13Z
**Engineer:** Ralph (loop i=144)
**Plan Reference:** plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M0a–M0c
**Git Commit:** (captured in commands.txt)

## Objective

Guard CLI-FLAGS-003 debug instrumentation (`_last_tricubic_neighborhood`) to prevent unconditional payload retention during production runs and ensure device/dtype neutrality per docs/development/testing_strategy.md §1.4.

## Checklist (Phase M0a–M0c)

### M0a: Audit tricubic neighborhood cache scope ✅

**Finding:** `_last_tricubic_neighborhood` was unconditionally populated on every `_tricubic_interpolation` call (crystal.py:432-440), regardless of whether trace mode was active.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `self._enable_trace = False` flag to `Crystal.__init__` (crystal.py:123-124)

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
0. **Phase M0 instrumentation hygiene** — Guard the new tricubic neighborhood cache (plan tasks M0a–M0c) so debug tensors stay device/dtype neutral and do not leak giant batches. Log findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/instrumentation_audit.md` and append an Attempt before re-running traces.
1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
4. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (spec citation, bug ledger, fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before resuming full Phase M parity runs.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Test collection: 35 tests collected successfully in 2.16s (test_cli_scaling_phi0.py + test_phi_carryover_mode.py). Documentation-only loop per input.md Mode: Docs.

### Phase M0 — Trace Instrumentation Hygiene
Goal: Ensure CLI-FLAGS-003 debug instrumentation stays scoped to trace loops and remains device/dtype neutral before continuing Phase M.
Prereqs: Phase L complete; instrumentation from commit 9a8c2f5 captured in trace harness.
Exit Criteria: Debug helpers guarded behind the trace flag, tensors allocated on caller device/dtype, and findings logged in fix_plan with artifact paths under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/`.

### Phase M — Structure-Factor & Normalization Parity (VG‑2)
Goal: Eliminate the `I_before_scaling` divergence by ensuring PyTorch fetches the same HKL amplitudes and lattice factors as C for the supervisor ROI pixels.
Prereqs: Phase L complete and Phase M0 instrumentation tasks marked [D] so traces/tests use aligned tolerances. Instrumentation from Phase L2b (`trace_harness.py`, simulator taps) already in place.
Exit Criteria: `trace_harness.py` comparisons show `F_cell`, `F_latt`, and `I_before_scaling` deltas ≤1e-6 relative, with artifacts under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`. Regression tests cover the fixed code path.

| M1 | Audit HKL lookup parity | [ ] | Use `trace_harness.py` to log `hkl_frac`, integer HKL indices, and fetched amplitudes for pixel (685,1039). Compare against C trace (`c_trace_phi_20251123.log`). Store diff in `reports/.../scaling_validation/<timestamp>/hkldata.md`.

**Organizing input.md contents**

I’m outlining what needs to be included in the input.md to guide Ralph properly, making sure to cover summary, mode, focus, branch, mapped tests, artifacts, and precise “Do Now” commands that match the actual scripts and their CLI usage. I plan to verify script details before finalizing those instructions.

Phase L3e: Compare C and PyTorch scaling traces with sub-micro tolerance enforcement.

This script aligns TRACE_C and TRACE_PY outputs from the scaling audit and
reports percentage deltas for each scaling factor to identify the first divergence.

Outputs:
    - Markdown summary (--out argument)
    - metrics.json (structured per-factor deltas)
    - run_metadata.json (environment snapshot + command parameters)

Usage:
    python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py \\
        --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log \\
        --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log \\
        --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/scaling_validation_summary.md

I’m outlining steps to fix the script causing SIGKILL issues, likely due to memory and path handling. I plan to instruct running `trace_harness` to generate fresh traces, then rerunning the fixed script with updated paths. I’m also considering including commands for targeted pytest runs to verify no regressions, and gathering line numbers from related docs for updating `input.md` with clear priorities and rationale.

   442	- First Divergence (if known): `parse_and_validate_args` (src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:435) calls `read_hkl_file`/`try_load_hkl_or_fdump` without forwarding the parsed dtype, so HKL/Fdump data is always loaded as float32. When the CLI is run with `-dtype float64`, the simulator converts those float32 tensors to float64 later, permanently losing precision relative to the requested double-precision path and violating the DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 guarantee.
   443	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   444	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   445	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   446	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   447	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   448	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   449	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

**Outlining input.md content and commands**

I'm organizing the structure and key details for the new input.md file, deciding how to reference audit paths, specify artifact directories, list targeted tests, and craft the "Do Now" command for rerunning and verifying scaling trace comparisons with updated scripts. I'm also noting the need to review the existing C trace path to ensure the instructions point to the correct files.

**Drafting detailed instructions and plan**

I'm outlining a comprehensive how-to for fixing the scaling comparison script, including command examples, file paths with timestamps, testing notes, pitfalls, and documentation references. I'll focus on making the instructions clear for reproducing traces, running validations, and capturing environment details, aiming for a 100-200 line `input.md` file next.
[2025-10-08T07:19:16] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Stabilize the scaling comparison script so Phase M parity evidence can resume.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests:
- pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py
Artifacts:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/commands.txt
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/metrics.json
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/run_metadata.json
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/sha256.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 — fix scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py and rerun "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md`
If Blocked: Capture stderr/exit code inside <timestamp>/commands.txt, stash the partial outputs, and stop; note the failure in instrumentation_audit.md for supervisor review.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:64 — Phase M1 is still open until compare_scaling_traces.py can run on fresh traces without crashing.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Next Actions now require stabilising the scaling comparison tooling before further lattice debugging.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt — Recorded SIGKILL repro; closing it is prerequisite for new evidence.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:35 — Device/dtype neutrality applies to debug tooling; keep the script GPU-safe after the fix.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Existing CLI contract/behavior; changes must preserve summary + metrics outputs.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — φ carryover bug context; maintain dual-mode trace semantics while updating tooling.
How-To Map:
1. `ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; `RUN_DIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$ts`; `mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"`.
2. Append `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status -sb` to `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt` for provenance.
3. Generate a fresh PyTorch trace: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --phi-mode c-parity --pixel 685 1039 --device cpu --dtype float64 --out "$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log"` and log the command.
4. Patch `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` so it handles the current trace payload without crashing; keep parsing tolerant of pre/post-polar labels and large floats.
5. Re-run the Do Now command (above) pointing `--py` at `$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log`; expect `scaling_validation_summary.md`, `metrics.json`, and `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
6. Capture environment info with `python - <<'"'PY'"'` to dump torch/device metadata into `$RUN_DIR/run_metadata.json` if the script does not already include device info.
7. Execute targeted tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
8. Compute checksums: `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt)`.
9. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 guidance and add a new Attempt entry to `docs/fix_plan.md` summarising the fix + artifact path.
10. Record summary findings (first divergence, residual delta) in `$RUN_DIR/scaling_validation_summary.md` and note follow-up steps for Phase M2.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not remove the trace harness guard (`Crystal._enable_trace`); keep instrumentation opt-in.
- Avoid hard-coding CPU paths in compare_scaling_traces.py; preserve device/dtype neutrality for CUDA runs.
- Do not skip updating commands.txt and sha256.txt; provenance is mandatory for Phase M evidence.
- No full pytest runs this loop; stick to the targeted parity suites outlined above.
- Preserve vectorization—do not introduce Python loops into the trace harness or simulator while debugging the script.
- Keep Protected Assets untouched (input.md, docs/index.md, loop.sh, supervisor.sh).
- Do not downgrade tolerances; the summary must still enforce ≤1e-6 thresholds.
- Maintain ASCII-only edits and include CLAUDE Rule #11 references if additional C-code snippets are cited.
- Ensure KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK remains set for every torch import.
- Avoid deleting prior report directories; create a new timestamped run.

Summary: Stabilize the scaling comparison script so Phase M parity evidence can resume.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests:

Artifacts:

- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/sha256.txt
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 — fix scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py and rerun "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md`
If Blocked: Capture stderr/exit code inside <timestamp>/commands.txt, stash the partial outputs, and stop; note the failure in instrumentation_audit.md for supervisor review.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:64 — Phase M1 is still open until compare_scaling_traces.py can run on fresh traces without crashing.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Next Actions now require stabilising the scaling comparison tooling before further lattice debugging.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt — Recorded SIGKILL repro; closing it is prerequisite for new evidence.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:35 — Device/dtype neutrality applies to debug tooling; keep the script GPU-safe after the fix.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Existing CLI contract/behavior; changes must preserve summary + metrics outputs.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — φ carryover bug context; maintain dual-mode trace semantics while updating tooling.
How-To Map:
1. `ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; `RUN_DIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$ts`; `mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"`.
2. Append `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status -sb` to `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt` for provenance.
3. Generate a fresh PyTorch trace: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --phi-mode c-parity --pixel 685 1039 --device cpu --dtype float64 --out "$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log"` and log the command.
4. Patch `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` so it handles the current trace payload without crashing; keep parsing tolerant of pre/post-polar labels and large floats.
5. Re-run the Do Now command (above) pointing `--py` at `$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log`; expect `scaling_validation_summary.md`, `metrics.json`, and `run_metadata.json` in the same directory.
6. Capture environment info with `python - <<'"'PY'"'` to dump torch/device metadata into `$RUN_DIR/run_metadata.json` if the script does not already include device info.
7. Execute targeted tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
8. Compute checksums: `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt)`.
9. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 guidance and add a new Attempt entry to `docs/fix_plan.md` summarising the fix + artifact path.

Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 — repair scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py and rerun "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md`
If Blocked: Stop immediately after recording stderr, exit code, and the offending command inside <timestamp>/commands.txt; dump any partial outputs, note the failure in instrumentation_audit.md, and ping galph before attempting alternate fixes.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:64 — Phase M1 still awaits a working scaling comparison pipeline; the crashing script blocks HKL parity analysis.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Latest Next Actions demand stabilising compare_scaling_traces.py before moving to lattice-factor fixes.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt — Historical SIGKILL repro; resolving this regression is prerequisite for new evidence.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Tool must continue emitting markdown + metrics.json outputs for audit trails.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:35 — Device/dtype neutrality applies to debug utilities; fixes must retain GPU compatibility.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — φ carryover bug context; Phase M evidence must keep spec vs c-parity semantics distinct.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md:76 — Upcoming C5/D3 documentation tasks depend on fresh scaling artifacts once this tool is healthy.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/instrumentation_audit.md — Confirms instrumentation guard is in place; the comparison script should assume `_enable_trace` gating remains.
How-To Map:
1. Export canonical timestamp: `ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)` and set `RUN_DIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$ts`.
2. Create the run directory: `mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"` and confirm it exists.
3. Start provenance log: `git rev-parse HEAD >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` and `git status -sb >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
4. Record environment exports: append `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `export PYTHONPATH=src` to commands.txt to document the runtime setup.
5. Generate a fresh PyTorch scaling trace (c-parity path):
   `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py '"\\
     --config supervisor --phi-mode c-parity --pixel 685 1039 \\
     --device cpu --dtype float64 --out \""'$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log"`.
6. Tee stdout/stderr of the harness into commands.txt (e.g., use `| tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`).
7. Capture the environment snapshot if the harness did not update env.json this run:
   `python - <<'"'PY'
import json, platform, torch
payload = {
    \"python\": platform.python_version(),
    \"platform\": platform.platform(),
    \"torch_version\": torch.__version__,
    \"cuda_available\": torch.cuda.is_available(),
    \"git_sha\": \""'$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
}
with open("$RUN_DIR/env.json", "w") as fh:
    json.dump(payload, fh, indent=2)
PY`.
8. Open `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` and implement the fix so it safely parses the current trace schema (handle both pre/post polar entries, large float magnitudes, and absent fields without throwing or exhausting memory).
9. Dry-run the script with `--help` to confirm argparse still matches expectations; log the command in commands.txt.
10. Execute the Do Now command using the freshly generated trace; expect new summary and metrics files in RUN_DIR.
11. Review `scaling_validation_summary.md` to ensure the first divergence is still I_before_scaling and that the script now terminates cleanly; annotate notable deltas inside the summary.
12. Capture `run_metadata.json` contents and verify tolerance + command fields look correct; adjust if necessary before proceeding.
13. Run targeted parity tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` to confirm no regressions.
14. Compute checksums for the run directory: `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt)`; ensure sha file is appended, not overwritten.
15. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 row with the new timestamp/notes and mark any checklist adjustments triggered by the tooling fix.
16. Add a fresh Attempt entry beneath `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 capturing the script fix, artifact path, test results, and residual metrics; include git SHA and timestamp.
17. If new diagnostics suggest further instrumentation work, note the follow-up directly in `$RUN_DIR/scaling_validation_summary.md` and reference it in fix_plan for continuity.
18. Ensure `commands.txt` is chronologically ordered and contains every command executed, including tests, harness runs, script invocations, and tooling checks.
19. Double-check that no code paths outside scripting/tooling were modified; if auxiliary edits were needed, document them explicitly in fix_plan and the Attempt log.
20. Leave the working directory clean after committing; if uncommitted artifacts must remain, document why in docs/fix_plan Attempt and ping supervisor.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not remove or bypass `_enable_trace`; Phase M0 guard must remain intact.
- Avoid CPU-only constants or `.cpu()` calls inside the comparison script; keep it device agnostic.
- Do not overwrite previous reports; always create a new timestamped directory.
- Resist the temptation to downgrade tolerance thresholds — keep ≤1e-6 relative checks.
- Do not skip the targeted pytest run; parity tooling lives alongside physics tests.
- Keep Protected Assets (`input.md`, `docs/index.md`, `loop.sh`, `supervisor.sh`) untouched.
- Stay within ASCII; no stray Unicode in scripts or documentation updates.
- Do not introduce blocking sleeps or manual `time.sleep` instrumentation; keep scripts fast.
- Avoid altering trace_harness CLI in ways that break prior runs; any changes must remain backward-compatible.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` prefixes every torch invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- When editing docs/fix_plan, follow existing formatting; no large-scale refactors this loop.
- Do not run the full pytest suite; evidence gate only permits the mapped tests.

Summary: Stabilize the scaling comparison tooling so Phase M parity evidence can proceed without manual workarounds.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests:
- pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py
Artifacts:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/commands.txt
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/metrics.json
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/run_metadata.json
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/sha256.txt
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/env.json
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md (updated Phase M1 row)
- docs/fix_plan.md (new Attempt entry for this run)
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 — repair scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py and rerun "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md`
If Blocked: Stop immediately after recording stderr, exit code, and the offending command inside <timestamp>/commands.txt; dump any partial outputs, note the failure in instrumentation_audit.md, and ping galph before attempting alternate fixes.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:64 — Phase M1 still awaits a working scaling comparison pipeline; the crashing script blocks HKL parity analysis.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Latest Next Actions demand stabilising compare_scaling_traces.py before moving to lattice-factor fixes.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt — Historical SIGKILL repro; resolving this regression is prerequisite for new evidence.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Tool must continue emitting markdown + metrics.json outputs for audit trails.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:35 — Device/dtype neutrality applies to debug utilities; fixes must retain GPU compatibility.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — φ carryover bug context; Phase M evidence must keep spec vs c-parity semantics distinct.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md:76 — Upcoming C5/D3 documentation tasks depend on fresh scaling artifacts once this tool is healthy.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/instrumentation_audit.md — Confirms instrumentation guard is in place; the comparison script should assume `_enable_trace` gating remains.
How-To Map:
1. Export canonical timestamp: `ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)` and set `RUN_DIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$ts`.
2. Create the run directory: `mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"` and confirm it exists.
3. Start provenance log: `git rev-parse HEAD >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` and `git status -sb >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
4. Record environment exports: append `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `export PYTHONPATH=src` to commands.txt to document the runtime setup.
5. Generate a fresh PyTorch scaling trace (c-parity path):
   `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py '"\\
     --config supervisor --phi-mode c-parity --pixel 685 1039 \\
     --device cpu --dtype float64 --out \""'$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log"`.
6. Tee stdout/stderr of the harness into commands.txt (e.g., use `| tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`).
7. Capture the environment snapshot if the harness did not update env.json this run:
   `python - <<'"'PY'
import json, platform, torch
payload = {
    \"python\": platform.python_version(),
    \"platform\": platform.platform(),
    \"torch_version\": torch.__version__,
    \"cuda_available\": torch.cuda.is_available(),
    \"git_sha\": \""'$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
}
with open("$RUN_DIR/env.json", "w") as fh:
    json.dump(payload, fh, indent=2)
PY`.
8. Open `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` and implement the fix so it safely parses the current trace schema (handle both pre/post polar entries, large float magnitudes, and absent fields without throwing or exhausting memory).
9. Dry-run the script with `--help` to confirm argparse still matches expectations; log the command in commands.txt.
10. Execute the Do Now command using the freshly generated trace; expect new summary and metrics files in RUN_DIR.
11. Review `scaling_validation_summary.md` to ensure the first divergence is still I_before_scaling and that the script now terminates cleanly; annotate notable deltas inside the summary.
12. Capture `run_metadata.json` contents and verify tolerance + command fields look correct; adjust if necessary before proceeding.
13. Run targeted parity tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` to confirm no regressions.
14. Compute checksums for the run directory: `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt)`; ensure sha file is appended, not overwritten.
15. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 row with the new timestamp/notes and mark any checklist adjustments triggered by the tooling fix.
16. Add a fresh Attempt entry beneath `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 capturing the script fix, artifact path, test results, and residual metrics; include git SHA and timestamp.
17. If new diagnostics suggest further instrumentation work, note the follow-up directly in `$RUN_DIR/scaling_validation_summary.md` and reference it in fix_plan for continuity.
18. Ensure `commands.txt` is chronologically ordered and contains every command executed, including tests, harness runs, script invocations, and tooling checks.
19. Double-check that no code paths outside scripting/tooling were modified; if auxiliary edits were needed, document them explicitly in fix_plan and the Attempt log.

 ### Phase M — Structure-Factor & Normalization Parity (VG‑2)
 Goal: Eliminate the `I_before_scaling` divergence by ensuring PyTorch fetches the same HKL amplitudes and lattice factors as C for the supervisor ROI pixels.

Summary: Stabilize scaling comparison tooling so Phase M parity evidence can resume with scripted outputs.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests:

Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 — repair scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py and rerun "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/trace_py_scaling.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/scaling_validation_summary.md`
If Blocked: Halt as soon as the script still crashes; record stdout/stderr + exit code in <timestamp>/commands.txt, dump partial outputs, annotate instrumentation_audit.md with the failure mode, and escalate to galph before exploring alternative fixes.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:64 — Phase M1 checklist explicitly cites the compare_scaling_traces.py crash; fixing it unblocks lattice analysis.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Current Next Actions start with “Stabilise scaling comparison tooling,” so this loop should close that gap first.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt:1 — Documents the historical SIGKILL repro; new evidence must supersede this failure log.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Script must keep emitting markdown + metrics for first-divergence tracking; edits must stay faithful to existing CLI contract.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:35 — Guardrails demand device/dtype neutrality even for tooling fixes; ensure the script stays GPU-safe.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — φ carryover bug context; the tool must interpret pre/post-polar traces correctly to maintain dual-mode parity evidence.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md:76 — C5 documentation hand-off insists on updated scaling artifacts; this tooling fix is prerequisite.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/instrumentation_audit.md:1 — Confirms trace guards; new script must respect `_enable_trace` design (trace-only data written when enabled).
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:80 — Vectorization section reminds us to avoid reintroducing loops while touching trace tooling.
How-To Map:
1. Set up timestamp: `ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; record it in commands.txt for clarity.
2. Define the run directory: `RUN_DIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$ts`.
3. Create directories with parents: `mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"` and verify using `test -d "$RUN_DIR"`.
4. Start provenance logging: `git rev-parse HEAD >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
5. Append short status snapshot: `git status -sb >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` to show cleanliness pre-work.
6. Log environment exports: echo `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `export PYTHONPATH=src` into commands.txt.
7. Capture editable install status: `pip show nanobragg-torch >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` (or equivalent) for reproducibility.
8. Run the c-parity harness to write PyTorch trace: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --phi-mode c-parity --pixel 685 1039 --device cpu --dtype float64 --out "$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log" | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
9. Optionally run spec-mode trace for sanity: repeat Step 8 with `--phi-mode spec` writing to `$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling_spec.log` if quick verification is needed.
10. Snapshot runtime environment into env.json using a short python block capturing python/torch versions, CUDA availability, and git sha.
11. Inspect `trace_py_scaling.log` quickly to ensure TRACE_PY lines exist; note anomalies immediately.
12. Edit `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` so it tolerates the current trace schema (handle `_pre_polar/_post_polar`, avoid assumptions about column counts, and skip malformed lines gracefully).
13. Ensure the script still imports only standard libraries (plus torch for metadata); avoid heavy dependencies.
14. Run `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --help` and append the output to commands.txt for CLI verification.
15. Execute the Do Now command (with updated script) referencing `$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log`; tee stdout/stderr into commands.txt.
16. Confirm creation of `scaling_validation_summary.md`, `metrics.json`, and `run_metadata.json` inside RUN_DIR; record their presence in commands.txt.
17. Review summary markdown, double-check that I_before_scaling remains the first divergence, and note relative delta (~−0.2086%) to keep historical context.
18. Validate metrics.json structure — ensure tolerance_rel and first_divergence entries populate correctly.
19. Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py --collect-only | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` to demonstrate selector still collects (evidence gate expectation).
20. Execute full targeted tests: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
21. If CUDA available, optionally run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py -k cuda` to ensure GPU path unaffected; log skip if unavailable.
22. Compute directory checksums: `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt)`; list sha file contents in commands.txt.
23. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 How/Why column with the new timestamp, confirming the tooling fix and referencing the RUN_DIR path.
24. Add an Attempt entry to `docs/fix_plan.md` under CLI-FLAGS-003 summarising the script repair, tests run, artifact paths, residual delta, and next steps (Phase M2 lattice work).
25. If additional script tweaks were needed (e.g., new CLI flags), capture rationale plus usage notes in commands.txt and fix_plan to avoid future confusion.
26. Append a short narrative to `$RUN_DIR/scaling_validation_summary.md` describing observed deltas and recommended follow-ups (e.g., logging 4×4×4 weights next loop).
27. Re-run `git status -sb` post-changes and append to commands.txt for closing snapshot.
28. Ensure working tree is clean aside from intended modifications (script, plan, fix_plan, reports, input); remediate stray files before commit.
29. Stage files logically (script + reports + plan + fix_plan + input) and prepare commit message referencing SUPERVISOR instructions (galph will commit, but maintain order).
30. Leave a TODO in Attempt log if residual issues remain (e.g., script still fragile on spec traces) so next loop picks it up.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not remove `_enable_trace` or undo Phase M0 guards.
- Avoid hard-coded CPU paths or `.cpu()` conversions in tooling.
- Do not overwrite historical report directories; always create a fresh timestamp.
- Keep tolerance thresholds at ≤1e-6; no loosening for convenience.
- Do not skip targeted pytest runs; they verify parity code paths.
- Protected Assets (input.md, docs/index.md, loop.sh, supervisor.sh) must remain untouched.
- Retain ASCII-only edits; no fancy Unicode or emoji.
- Do not introduce blocking sleeps; scripts should terminate promptly.
- Maintain backward compatibility of CLI flags; no breaking changes to trace harness or compare script arguments.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` prefixes every torch-based command to avoid MKL errors.
- Avoid editing physics code this loop; scope is tooling/docs only.
- Update plan/fix_plan exactly once; keep formatting consistent (tables, attempt numbering).
- Capture full command chronology; missing provenance blocks plan sign-off.
- Do not run full pytest suite; evidence cadence forbids it.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
-0. **Phase M0 instrumentation hygiene** — Guard the new tricubic neighborhood cache (plan tasks M0a–M0c) so debug tensors stay device/dtype neutral and do not leak giant batches. Log findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/instrumentation_audit.md` and append an Attempt before re-running traces.
-1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
-2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
-3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
-4. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (spec citation, bug ledger, fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before resuming full Phase M parity runs.
+- Next Actions (2025-12-05 refresh):
+1. **Stabilise scaling comparison tooling** — Reproduce and fix the `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` SIGKILL observed in Attempts #137/#141 so Phase M evidence can be generated via the canonical script instead of inline Python. Capture the patched command + sha catalog in a fresh `reports/.../scaling_validation/<timestamp>/` directory.
+2. **Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up** — Augment the trace harness (if needed) to log 4×4×4 neighbourhood weights / `sincg` inputs alongside the existing traces, then update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1 guidance with the 20251008T070513Z audit path and the new metrics. Document results in `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt log.
+3. **Phase M2 lattice investigation** — Use the refreshed instrumentation to isolate the φ₀ `F_latt` drift (≈0.13%). Compare against `nanoBragg.c` accumulation loops, implement the fix, and add a targeted pytest (`tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestScalingParity::test_I_before_scaling_matches_c`).
+4. **Phase N/O readiness** — Once scaling deltas ≤1e-6, regenerate nb-compare ROI artifacts and schedule the supervisor command closure run with SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
+5. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (summary.md + spec citation + fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before the final parity rerun.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
-0. **Phase M0 instrumentation hygiene** — Guard the new tricubic neighborhood cache (plan tasks M0a–M0c) so debug tensors stay device/dtype neutral and do not leak giant batches. Log findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/instrumentation_audit.md` and append an Attempt before re-running traces.
-1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
-2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
-3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
-4. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (spec citation, bug ledger, fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before resuming full Phase M parity runs.
+- Next Actions (2025-12-05 refresh):
+1. **Stabilise scaling comparison tooling** — Reproduce and fix the `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` SIGKILL observed in Attempts #137/#141 so Phase M evidence can be generated via the canonical script instead of inline Python. Capture the patched command + sha catalog in a fresh `reports/.../scaling_validation/<timestamp>/` directory.
+2. **Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up** — Augment the trace harness (if needed) to log 4×4×4 neighbourhood weights / `sincg` inputs alongside the existing traces, then update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1 guidance with the 20251008T070513Z audit path and the new metrics. Document results in `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt log.
+3. **Phase M2 lattice investigation** — Use the refreshed instrumentation to isolate the φ₀ `F_latt` drift (≈0.13%). Compare against `nanoBragg.c` accumulation loops, implement the fix, and add a targeted pytest (`tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestScalingParity::test_I_before_scaling_matches_c`).
+4. **Phase N/O readiness** — Once scaling deltas ≤1e-6, regenerate nb-compare ROI artifacts and schedule the supervisor command closure run with SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

Summary: Repair the scaling comparison script so Phase M parity evidence flows through scripted outputs instead of manual summaries.

If Blocked: Halt immediately once the script still crashes; capture full stdout/stderr plus exit code in <timestamp>/commands.txt, stash any partial outputs, update instrumentation_audit.md with the new failure, and page galph rather than attempting alternate fixes.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:64 — Phase M1 checklist explicitly cites the crashing compare_scaling_traces.py; resolving it is the gate to HKL parity work.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Next Actions start with “Stabilise scaling comparison tooling,” so this iteration focuses there.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt — Historical SIGKILL repro; new evidence must supersede it with a clean run.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Script must continue emitting markdown and metrics.json for audit; fixes must retain CLI semantics.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:35 — Device/dtype neutrality extends to tooling; avoid CPU-only assumptions.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — φ carryover context; script needs to read both spec and c-parity traces faithfully.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md:76 — Phase C5/D3 documentation depends on refreshed scaling outputs once the script works.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/instrumentation_audit.md:1 — Confirms `_enable_trace` guard; tooling changes must respect trace-only capture.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:80 — Vectorization narrative; avoid slipping back to scalar loops while patching tooling.
Verification Checklist:
- Confirm the repaired script exits 0 and produces summary + metrics files.
- Validate metrics.json `first_divergence` remains `I_before_scaling`.
- Ensure summary shows relative delta ≈ −2.086e-03 (current parity gap) for continuity.
- Make sure targeted pytest run passes on CPU; optionally include CUDA if available.
- Check plan + fix_plan updates include timestamp and artifact paths.
- Verify sha256.txt covers all generated artifacts (no omissions).
How-To Map:
1. `ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; note this value in commands.txt for traceability.
2. `RUN_DIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$ts` to scope outputs.
3. `mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"` ensuring parent directories exist; verify with `ls "$RUN_DIR"`.
4. Append `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status -sb` to `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt` for pre-work provenance.
5. Log runtime exports: echo `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `export PYTHONPATH=src` into commands.txt.
6. Capture editable install metadata via `pip show nanobragg-torch >> "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"` (or log failure if not installed).
7. Generate c-parity trace: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --config supervisor --phi-mode c-parity --pixel 685 1039 --device cpu --dtype float64 --out "$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling.log" | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
8. Optionally run spec-mode trace to confirm divergence expectations: repeat Step 7 with `--phi-mode spec --out "$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling_spec.log"`.
9. Convert per-φ JSON: if harness supports `--dump-per-phi`, enable it so `$RUN_DIR/trace_py_scaling_per_phi.log/json` capture references.
10. Build env.json snapshot using a short python script capturing python version, OS, torch version, CUDA availability, git sha, and timestamp.
11. Inspect the trace file headers to ensure TRACE_PY labels align with script expectations (pre/post polar present exactly once).
12. Edit `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; focus on robust parsing (no `split()` assumptions beyond two columns), guard against `ValueError`, and ensure `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` mapping remains.
13. Add inline comments if new logic references C behavior; cite nanoBragg.c lines to satisfy CLAUDE Rule #11 when needed.
14. Run `python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --help` and append output to commands.txt.
15. Execute the Do Now command referencing the new trace; tee stdout into commands.txt for audit.
16. Confirm `scaling_validation_summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `run_metadata.json` appear in RUN_DIR; list them in commands.txt.
17. Review summary content, ensuring Markdown tables render properly and note the absolute & relative deltas for I_before_scaling.
18. Check metrics.json structure: `tolerance_rel`, `first_divergence`, `num_divergent`, `factors` keys should populate.
19. Optionally run script with spec-mode trace to confirm it reports expected large divergence; record results if executed.
20. Run collect-only selectors:
    - `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`
    - `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`
21. Execute targeted parity tests on CPU: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee -a "$RUN_DIR/commands.txt"`.
22. If CUDA is available, optionally run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -xvs tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py -k cuda` and record pass/skip.
23. Compute checksums: `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt)`; append file list + sha output to commands.txt.
24. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 How/Why column with the new timestamp and tooling fix summary.
25. Add a detailed Attempt entry under `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 noting the script repair, tests, artifacts, and residual ΔI_before_scaling.
26. Document any follow-up hypotheses (e.g., need to log 4×4×4 weights) at the bottom of `scaling_validation_summary.md` to guide Phase M2.
27. Record final `git status -sb` in commands.txt to show clean state after work.
28. Stage modified files and prepare for supervisor commit (galph handles final commit but staging should be ready).
29. Keep RUN_DIR tree intact; do not prune intermediate logs.
30. If additional diagnostics were run (spec trace, CUDA run), mention them in fix_plan Attempt to avoid losing context.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not revert `_enable_trace` guard; Phase M0 hygiene must persist.
- Avoid hard-coded `.cpu()` calls in tooling; maintain device neutrality.
- Do not overwrite previous report directories; new timestamp every run.
- No tolerance downgrades—stick with ≤1e-6 relative thresholds.
- Do not skip targeted pytest runs or the collect-only validation.
- Leave Protected Assets untouched (input.md, docs/index.md, loop.sh, supervisor.sh).
- Maintain ASCII-only edits; no Unicode or fancy formatting.
- Avoid introducing sleeps or long-running loops in scripts.
- Keep compare_scaling_traces.py backwards compatible with prior CLI options.
- Prefix every torch command with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to avoid MKL issues.
- Scope code edits to tooling/docs only; no physics changes this loop.
- Ensure commands.txt records every command chronologically; missing provenance blocks plan closure.
- Do not run full pytest suite; evidence gate forbids it.
- Guard against accidental deletion of c_trace_scaling.log; treat it as canonical C reference.
- Remember to update plan and fix_plan exactly once with clear timestamps.

25. Add a detailed Attempt entry under `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 noting the script repair, tests, artifacts, and residual ΔI_before_scaling.
26. Document any follow-up hypotheses (e.g., need to log 4×4×4 weights) at the bottom of `scaling_validation_summary.md` to guide Phase M2.
27. Record final `git status -sb` in commands.txt to show clean state after work.
28. Stage modified files and prepare for supervisor commit (galph handles final commit but staging should be ready).
29. Keep RUN_DIR tree intact; do not prune intermediate logs.
30. If additional diagnostics were run (spec trace, CUDA run), mention them in fix_plan Attempt to avoid losing context.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not revert `_enable_trace` guard; Phase M0 hygiene must persist.
- Avoid hard-coded `.cpu()` calls in tooling; maintain device neutrality.
- Do not overwrite previous report directories; new timestamp every run.
- No tolerance downgrades—stick with ≤1e-6 relative thresholds.
- Do not skip targeted pytest runs or the collect-only validation.
- Leave Protected Assets untouched (input.md, docs/index.md, loop.sh, supervisor.sh).
- Maintain ASCII-only edits; no Unicode or fancy formatting.
- Avoid introducing sleeps or long-running loops in scripts.
- Keep compare_scaling_traces.py backwards compatible with prior CLI options.
- Prefix every torch command with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to avoid MKL issues.
- Scope code edits to tooling/docs only; no physics changes this loop.
- Ensure commands.txt records every command chronologically; missing provenance blocks plan closure.
- Do not run full pytest suite; evidence gate forbids it.
- Guard against accidental deletion of c_trace_scaling.log; treat it as canonical C reference.
- Remember to update plan and fix_plan exactly once with clear timestamps.

 - First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-07 refresh → post-M1):
-0. **Phase M0 instrumentation hygiene** — Guard the new tricubic neighborhood cache (plan tasks M0a–M0c) so debug tensors stay device/dtype neutral and do not leak giant batches. Log findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/instrumentation_audit.md` and append an Attempt before re-running traces.
-1. ✅ **Phase M1 complete** — Instrumentation aligned (pre-polar trace now canonical C comparison point, ~0.2% residual as expected)
-2. **Phase M2 investigation** — The ~0.2% I_before_scaling residual (941698.5 vs 943654.8) is within galph debug memo tolerance but should be understood. Investigate whether F_latt accumulation or float32 conversion contributes to the drift. No urgent action required unless downstream tests fail.
-3. **Phase N/O readiness** — Regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` and schedule supervisor command closure run, capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
-4. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (spec citation, bug ledger, fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before resuming full Phase M parity runs.
+- Next Actions (2025-12-05 refresh):
+1. **Stabilise scaling comparison tooling** — Reproduce and fix the `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` SIGKILL observed in Attempts #137/#141 so Phase M evidence can be generated via the canonical script instead of inline Python. Capture the patched command + sha catalog in a fresh `reports/.../scaling_validation/<timestamp>/` directory.
+2. **Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up** — Augment the trace harness (if needed) to log 4×4×4 neighbourhood weights / `sincg` inputs alongside the existing traces, then update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1 guidance with the 20251008T070513Z audit path and the new metrics. Document results in `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt log.
+3. **Phase M2 lattice investigation** — Use the refreshed instrumentation to isolate the φ₀ `F_latt` drift (≈0.13%). Compare against `nanoBragg.c` accumulation loops, implement the fix, and add a targeted pytest (`tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestScalingParity::test_I_before_scaling_matches_c`).
+4. **Phase N/O readiness** — Once scaling deltas ≤1e-6, regenerate nb-compare ROI artifacts and schedule the supervisor command closure run with SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
+5. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (summary.md + spec citation + fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before the final parity rerun.

PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic).

   871	## 2025-10-08 (galph loop — STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B setup)
   872	- Coin flip→heads: reviewed Ralph’s recent commits (`ef1f716`, `e97a66c`) and found them productive; Phase M1 instrumentation landed cleanly and pyrefly Phase A evidence captured without regressions.
   873	- Chosen focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B baseline run; no new plan required since `plans/active/static-pyrefly.md` already governs the workflow.
   874	- Actions this loop: refreshed `input.md` with Docs-mode guidance covering Phase B1–B3 deliverables (pyrefly.log, env.json, summary.md, fix_plan Attempt update) and reiterated artifact/timestamp reuse under `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/`.
   875	- No changes to docs/fix_plan.md this turn; expect Ralph to record Attempt #2 after the baseline run and keep the working tree clean.
   876	- Follow-up: next supervisor loop should inspect the new summary, decide on Phase C triage scope, and ensure pyrefly findings are mapped to owners/tests before delegating fixes.
   877	
   878	## 2025-12-04 (galph loop — CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 refresh)
   879	- Re-ran `trace_harness.py` in both spec and c-parity modes (float64/CPU) and stored evidence under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T055257Z/` (spec) and `.../20251008T055533Z/` (c-parity). Spec path diverges 14.6% as expected; c-parity delta shrank to 0.2086%.
   880	- Added Attempt #140 to `docs/fix_plan.md:510` capturing the new metrics plus the crash encountered when invoking `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` on these traces.
   881	- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:53` with the fresh timestamps and noted that Phase M1 remains open pending ≤1e-6 parity.
   882	- `compare_scaling_traces.py` currently exits via SIGKILL on the new traces; manual summaries were generated as a stopgap. Ralph needs to debug the script before Phase M2 lattice fixes proceed.
   883	- Next steps for Ralph: fix the comparison script, regenerate the scaling summary in a new timestamped directory (CPU float64, c-parity), then continue Phase M2 by targeting the φ₀ lattice-factor drift.
   884	- Working tree note: legacy galph log (`logs/feature-spec-based-2/galph/iter-00141_20251008_054647.log`) stayed untouched per policy; left uncommitted.
   885	
   886	## 2025-10-08 (galph loop — Phase M1 lattice delta audit)
   887	- Captured fresh c-parity trace via `trace_harness.py` (float64/CPU) and stored manual summary + metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/`; F_latt drift is ~0.13% and drives the 0.2086% `I_before_scaling` deficit.
   888	- `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` still dies via SIGKILL; left the failing command in commands.txt and regenerated the summary with inline Python.
   889	- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` (Attempt #141) and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 guidance to reference the new evidence and emphasise tricubic neighbourhood instrumentation.

**Preparing final summary message**
[2025-10-08T07:22:39] codex

Marked CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M0 as complete and re-aimed the plan/input toward fixing the scaling comparison tooling for Phase M1.

- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:53 now records M0a–M0c as [D] with Attempt #144 artifacts so Phase M prerequisites are formally satisfied.
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 refreshes the Next Actions list to target the compare_scaling_traces.py crash before moving into lattice fixes.
- input.md:1 hands Ralph a 100-line Parity-mode brief to repair the script, capture a new RUN_DIR trace, run targeted pytest, and log Phase M evidence.
- galph_memory.md:906 logs this loop’s decisions and expectations for the upcoming engineering turn.

Next Up:
1. Follow the new input.md to fix scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py, generate the timestamped scaling_validation artifacts, and update plan + fix_plan with the run results.
2. After the tooling stabilises, proceed into Phase M2 to chase the φ₀ F_latt drift and lock I_before_scaling parity within 1e-6.

+| M0a | Audit tricubic neighborhood cache scope | [D] | ✅ Attempt #144 (20251008T070513Z) guarded `_last_tricubic_neighborhood` behind `Crystal._enable_trace`; production runs clear the field. Evidence: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/instrumentation_audit.md`. |
+| M0b | Keep debug tensors device/dtype neutral | [D] | ✅ Same attempt verified gather outputs already live on caller device/dtype; targeted pytest suite (CPU+CUDA, float32/float64) passes. Artifacts: `commands.txt`, `trace_py_scaling.log` under the 20251008T070513Z directory. |
+| M0c | Document instrumentation toggle | [D] | ✅ Harness + audit describe enabling via `debug_config={'trace_pixel': ...}` and capture commands/SHA256. Fix-plan Attempt #144 logged with git SHA + artifact path. |
 
 ### Phase M — Structure-Factor & Normalization Parity (VG‑2)
 Goal: Eliminate the `I_before_scaling` divergence by ensuring PyTorch fetches the same HKL amplitudes and lattice factors as C for the supervisor ROI pixels.
