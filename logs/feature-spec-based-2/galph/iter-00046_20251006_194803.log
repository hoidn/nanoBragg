review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Target spec: specs/spec-a.md (single-file normative spec)
Implementation target: Python (>=3.11) + PyTorch (float32 default). Type blocks may use TypeScript-style for clarity; implement with Python dataclasses and torch tensors.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

[2025-10-06T19:49:13] bash -lc "sed -n '1,200p' plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md" succeeded in 727ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).
  * `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` (≈2993-3151) — definitive implementation of the sincg calls and rounding logic.
  * `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` — simulator reference; docstring currently claims full-h usage and must be updated post-fix.
  * `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative pytest/trace commands for CLI parity evidence.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

**Performing deep codebase analysis**

I’m gathering info on the current state of tasks K2 and K3, checking plans like vectorization.md and unification.md, and reviewing documentation and commit history to identify unresolved issues and gaps regarding long-term goals, especially the pix0 parity problem and vectorization strategy. I want to ensure the plans are solid before moving on.

    Metrics: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python - <<'PY' … DetectorConfig(pix0_override_m=(0.1,0.2,0.3))` reproduces.
    Observations/Hypotheses: Parser/Noise guard completed (plan tasks B1/B2 ✅). `_calculate_pix0_vector()` needs to assign the override tensor and refresh `_cached_pix0_vector`; cache invalidation should reuse the same path.
    Next Actions: Implement detector fix (plan task B3), then add regression covering both meter/mm overrides before moving to Phase C.
  * [2025-10-05] Attempt #2 (ralph) — Result: success. Fixed detector override assignment bug (plan task B3 complete).
    Metrics: Detector now correctly assigns `self.pix0_vector` when override is provided. CLI pix0 conversion verified (100mm→0.1m, precision <1e-9).
    Artifacts:
      - Code fix at `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:391-407`
      - Smoke test validates tuple/tensor overrides with device/dtype coercion
      - End-to-end CLI test: `-pix0_vector_mm 100 200 300` → `pix0_vector tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])`
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Root cause: `_calculate_pix0_vector()` returned override without assignment (lines 395/397 before fix)
      - Fix: Assign to `self.pix0_vector` before return; also set `r_factor=1.0`, `distance_corrected=distance`, `close_distance=distance` for compatibility
      - Device/dtype neutrality preserved: override tensor coerced to detector's device/dtype via `.to()`
      - Differentiability maintained: no `.detach()` or `.cpu()` in override path
    Next Actions: Tasks B4/B5 (unit parity + cache hygiene) then Phase C validation. Note: Pre-existing test failure in test_at_cli_006 (scaling bug) unrelated to this fix.
  * [2025-10-05] Attempt #3 (ralph) — Result: success. Completed Phase B tasks B4/B5 (pix0 parser parity and detector cache stability).
    Metrics: Parser equivalence verified: `-pix0_vector -0.2 0.3 0.4` and `-pix0_vector_mm -200 300 400` both yield `pix0_override_m=(-0.2, 0.3, 0.4)`. Dual-flag error handling confirmed (raises ValueError). Detector cache stability verified across CPU/CUDA with invalidate_cache() preserving override tensor. CLI help smoke tests: 6/6 passed.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_b/detector/pix0_override_equivalence.txt` - Parser alias parity and dual-flag error handling
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_b/detector/cache_handoff.txt` - Cache stability across CPU/CUDA with device/dtype preservation

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6f: Force SAMPLE pivot when custom detector vectors present
    
    Implementation:
    - Updated DetectorConfig.__post_init__ to detect custom basis vectors

    Testing:
    - Added TestCLIPivotSelection regression test class
    - test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot validates 5 scenarios (CPU+CUDA, float32+float64)
    - Updated pix0_expected.json with SAMPLE pivot C reference values
    - Core suite: 61 passed (cli_flags 30/30, detector_geometry 12/12, crystal_geometry 19/19)
    
    Artifacts:

138:| H6b | Extend PyTorch trace harness | [D] | ✅ Attempt #37 (2025-10-06) patched `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py` to emit matching `TRACE_PY` lines after Detector geometry setup, removed the hard-coded BEAM pivot, and executed via `PYTHONPATH=src` to guarantee the editable implementation. Trace archived at `phase_h6/py_trace/trace_py_pix0.log` with env/git snapshots; residual ΔF = −1136 µm confirms instrumentation succeeded and Phase H6c analysis is next. |
139:| H6c | Diff traces & isolate first divergence | [D] | ✅ Attempt #38 (2025-10-26) produced `phase_h6/analysis.md` and `trace_diff.txt`; first divergence is the trace harness labeling beam-center values in millimetres while C logs meters. Pix0 deltas (ΔF = −1.136 mm, ΔS = +0.139 mm) persist, so the physical mismatch remains unresolved. `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` now records these findings. |

141:| H6e | Confirm pivot parity (SAMPLE vs BEAM) | [D] | ✅ Attempt #39 (2025-10-06) documented pivot mismatch in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md`. C evidence: `grep "pivoting"` shows "pivoting detector around sample". PyTorch evidence: inline config snippet shows DetectorPivot.BEAM. Root cause confirmed: `DetectorConfig` missing custom-vector-to-SAMPLE-pivot forcing rule. Spec citations and impact analysis complete. Updated `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with cross-reference. |

# Detector Architecture Deep Dive

**Status:** Authoritative Specification  
**Last Updated:** Phase 5 Implementation

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This component uses a [hybrid unit system](#61-critical-hybrid-unit-system-overrides-global-rule) that overrides the global Angstrom-only rule.

This document provides the complete technical specification for the Detector component. For global project rules on units and coordinate systems, see [Global Conventions](./conventions.md).

---

## 1. Overview

The Detector class manages the detector geometry for diffraction simulations, including:
- Position and orientation (basis vectors)
- Pixel coordinate generation and caching
- Support for various detector conventions (MOSFLM, XDS)
- Dynamic geometry with rotations and tilts
- Full differentiability for optimization workflows

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
+- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.

 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:

-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.

**Outlining detailed instructions and hypotheses**

I’m organizing a thorough instruction set for the user that covers directory setup, diffing commands, output locations, update notes, and how-to commands—all scoped to a length of 100-200 lines. Alongside, I’m forming hypotheses about unit mismatches and pivot forcing inconsistencies in the trace harness, planning to verify these by inspecting related code sections.

        - If only close_distance_mm is provided: pivot = SAMPLE
        - If detector_pivot is explicitly set: use that (explicit override wins)

        C-Code Implementation Reference (from nanoBragg.c, lines ~1690-1750):
        When custom detector vectors or pix0 override are present, C code forces SAMPLE pivot:
        ```c
        // C code forces SAMPLE pivot when custom vectors are supplied
        if (custom_fdet || custom_sdet || custom_odet || custom_beam || pix0_override) {
            detector_pivot = SAMPLE;  // Force SAMPLE mode for custom geometry
        }
        ```
        This ensures geometric consistency when detector orientation is overridden.
        See docs/architecture/detector.md §5.2 and specs/spec-a-cli.md precedence rules.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

      - `docs/fix_plan.md` - This Attempt #39 log
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **C pivot extraction:** `grep -i "pivoting" reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log` → "pivoting detector around sample"
      - **PyTorch pivot inspection:** Python snippet with supervisor command config parameters → DetectorPivot.BEAM
      - **Root cause confirmed:** `DetectorConfig` pivot selection does not force SAMPLE when custom detector vectors are present (missing C implicit rule)
      - **Impact quantified:** BEAM pivot formula (`pix0 = -Fbeam·fdet - Sbeam·sdet + distance·beam`) differs from SAMPLE pivot (`pix0 = -Fclose·fdet - Sclose·sdet + close_distance·odet`) → different pix0 vectors → cascading into 1.14mm delta
      - **Specification alignment:** specs/spec-a-cli.md and docs/architecture/detector.md §5.2 both require custom vectors → SAMPLE pivot
      - **Phase H6e exit criteria met:** Evidence documented, parity mismatch confirmed, spec references cited
    Next Actions: **Phase H6f required** — Implement custom-vector-to-SAMPLE-pivot forcing rule in `DetectorConfig.__post_init__`/`from_cli_args` (detect any of `custom_fdet_vector`, `custom_sdet_vector`, `custom_odet_vector`, `custom_beam_vector`, or `pix0_override_m` and force `detector_pivot=DetectorPivot.SAMPLE`), add regression test `tests/test_cli_flags.py::test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot` (CPU+CUDA), document in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md`, then proceed to Phase H6g (re-run PyTorch trace harness and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6).
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #40 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase H6f complete). **Custom detector basis vectors now force SAMPLE pivot matching C behavior.**
    Metrics: Core test suite 61/61 passed in 5.41s (cli_flags 30/30 including new pivot test, detector_geometry 12/12, crystal_geometry 19/19). New regression test validates pivot forcing across 4 parametrized variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). pix0 delta improved from 1.14 mm (BEAM pivot, wrong) to ~5 μm (SAMPLE pivot, correct).
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:255-268` - Added custom basis vector detection and SAMPLE pivot forcing in DetectorConfig.__post_init__
      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py:677-794` - Added TestCLIPivotSelection class with test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot regression test
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` - Complete implementation documentation with test results and next steps
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` - Moved parity visualization artifacts
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json` - Updated C reference values to SAMPLE pivot (-0.216476, 0.216343, -0.230192) from Phase H6a traces

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

**Outlining hypotheses and identifying gaps**

I’m mapping out hypotheses to identify current issues obstructing long-term goals like command impetus and vectorization. I want to review evidence, pinpoint outstanding tasks like scaling and normalization, and consider missing baseline data and reports to better frame next steps.

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

   120	### Phase H5 — Custom Vector Pix0 Override Parity
   121	Goal: Bring PyTorch pix0 precedence back in line with C when custom detector vectors accompany `-pix0_vector_mm`, eliminating the 1.14 mm delta driving the `F_latt` mismatch.
   122	Prereqs: Phase H4 artifacts available; C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.
   123	Exit Criteria: Detector traces with custom vectors show `pix0_vector`, `Fbeam`, and `Sbeam` matching C within 5e-5 m, and fractional h/k/l plus `F_latt_a/b/c` align within 1e-3 relative difference before resuming normalization work.

   126	| --- | --- | --- | --- |
   127	| H5a | Verify C precedence with explicit derivation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #30. C traces stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/` prove geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are present. `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` carries the dot-product derivation. |
   128	| H5b | Revert PyTorch override when custom vectors supplied | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31 (commit 831b670). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now gates pix0 overrides behind a `has_custom_vectors` check; regression log captured in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/pytest_h5b_revert.log`. Comments cite `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`. |
   129	| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [P] | ✅ Attempt #35 (2025-10-24) captured `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout` and refreshed `parity_summary.md`, but deltas remain large (ΔF = −1136 µm, ΔS = +139 µm). Keep this row in progress until follow-up Phase H6 diagnostics shrink |Δpix0| below the 5e-5 m threshold. |
   130	
   131	### Phase H6 — Pix0 Divergence Isolation
   132	Goal: Instrument both implementations to pinpoint the exact step in `_calculate_pix0_vector()` where the PyTorch BEAM-pivot math diverges from nanoBragg.c when custom detector vectors are present.
   133	Prereqs: Phase H5 artifacts archived (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/`), C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`, familiarity with `docs/architecture/detector.md` §5 and specs/spec-a-cli.md precedence rules.
   134	Exit Criteria: New traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/` showing matched step-by-step values, the first divergence documented in `parity_summary.md`, and docs/fix_plan Attempt #36 logging the diagnosis with remediation guidance.

SAMPLE pivot confirmed with C pix0 = (-0.216475836, 0.216343050, -0.230192414) m and basis vectors logged post-rotation. |
   139	| H6b | Extend PyTorch trace harness | [D] | ✅ Attempt #37 (2025-10-06) patched `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py` to emit matching `TRACE_PY` lines after Detector geometry setup, removed the hard-coded BEAM pivot, and executed via `PYTHONPATH=src` to guarantee the editable implementation. Trace archived at `phase_h6/py_trace/trace_py_pix0.log` with env/git snapshots; residual ΔF = −1136 µm confirms instrumentation succeeded and Phase H6c analysis is next. |

 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1.

Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2).

Summary: Capture post-pivot pix0 evidence so we can unblock normalization work.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare_summary.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/metadata.json
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6g pix0 trace verification — run "'`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`
If Blocked: Capture a terminal transcript showing the failure, stash it as `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_blocked.log`, and log Attempt history before exiting.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145 requires H6g trace rerun before Phase K can resume; we just marked H6f done, so evidence is now the gating item.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-462 commits us to Attempt #41 covering fresh pix0 parity artifacts prior to normalization.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log is the C ground truth; need a matching PyTorch trace for a direct diff.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md still reflects pre-pivot data; we must unblock its refresh with up-to-date geometry evidence.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1-68 highlights implicit pivot/pix0 rules we must respect when validating traces.
How-To Map:
- Ensure fresh directory: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix` before generating artifacts.
- Run trace harness command above (Do Now); redirect stdout to `.log` already handled via `--out` flag.
- Capture environment snapshot for reproducibility: `python - <<'"'PY' ..."'` to dump `sys.version`, `torch.__version__`, CUDA availability into `metadata.json` (store under same directory).
- Diff against C trace: `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt` (expect empty diff apart from TRACE prefixes).
- Summarize findings: create `nb_compare_summary.md` capturing |Δpix0| metrics, reference delta threshold (5e-5 m), and note whether additional deltas appear.
- Optional visual sanity check: `nb-compare --roi 1000 1100 600 700 --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare --resample --threshold 0.995 --c-bin ./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin ...` (reuse supervisor command flags) — document metrics in `nb_compare_summary.md`.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not run pytest or other tests this loop; Evidence phase prohibits it.
- Keep `PYTHONPATH=src` and `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set when invoking Python scripts.
- Do not edit code or plans mid-loop; focus on evidence capture only.
- Avoid overwriting prior Phase H6 artifacts; use the new `post_fix` subdirectory.
- Ensure the trace harness imports the editable package (no site-package fallback).
- Confirm the harness prints meters, not millimetres; note any unit discrepancies explicitly.
- Don’t skip Attempt logging in docs/fix_plan.md once artifacts exist.
- Maintain device neutrality—if CUDA is available, log whether the harness ran on CPU and why.
- Keep nb-compare outputs small (use ROI) to avoid large artifacts.
- Record the git commit hash in metadata for traceability.
Pointers:

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.

Summary: Capture post-pivot pix0 evidence so normalization work can safely resume.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare_summary.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/metadata.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_notes.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6g pix0 trace verification — run "'`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`
If Blocked: Capture the failure stdout/stderr and command in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_blocked.log`, snapshot `git status` + `python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`, and log Attempt history before exit.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145 lists H6g as the critical gate; without this evidence Phase K remains frozen.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-462 commits Attempt #41 to deliver post-pivot traces, nb-compare smoke, and delta analysis.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log is the C reference we must match to prove the pivot fix is correct in practice.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md still reports |Δpix0|≈1.1 mm; we must overwrite that narrative with measured <5e-5 m deltas.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1-68 documents implicit pivot rules; our evidence should cite these lines when summarizing findings.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md cannot be regenerated until H6g confirms geometry parity, so this loop unblocks the long-term goal.
- tests/test_cli_flags.py:677-794 already exercises the new pivot forcing; evidence must corroborate those expectations without modifying code.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md captures implementation intent; we need artifacts proving runtime behavior matches that documentation.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 — Prep directory: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix` (do not delete previous phase artifacts).
- Step 1 — Clean env notes: record `date` and `git rev-parse HEAD` to `metadata.json` using a small Python snippet that also logs `sys.version`, `torch.__version__`, `torch.cuda.is_available()`.
- Step 2 — Execute Do Now command; confirm stdout reports `TRACE_PY` entries with SAMPLE pivot and `pix0_before_rotation` values near -0.216476, 0.216343, -0.230192.
- Step 3 — Immediately duplicate the generated log to a timestamped backup (`cp trace_py.log trace_py_$(date +%H%M%S).log`) before editing so raw output is preserved.
- Step 4 — Run unified diff: `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt || true` and inspect for residual lines.
- Step 5 — Compute numerical deltas by scripting: `python - <<'"'PY'"'` to parse both traces, compute per-component differences for pix0, fdet, sdet, odet, close_distance, ratio; persist results into `attempt_notes.md`.
- Step 6 — If any delta exceeds 5e-5 m, repeat harness run after verifying units; otherwise, proceed to nb-compare smoke using the supervisor command arguments (ROI-limited) and store metrics/plots under `post_fix/nb_compare/` with summary entry.
- Step 7 — Update `attempt_notes.md` with precise commands, environment variables, measured deltas, and cross-reference to docs/fix_plan Attempt #41 requirements.
- Step 8 — Before concluding, draft bullet points for docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #41 (metrics, artifacts, first divergence) so the next implementation loop only needs copy/paste.
- Step 9 — Verify no accidental file edits occurred outside `reports/` or documentation by running `git status --short` and reviewing new files.
- Step 10 — If anything unexpected appears (e.g., harness auto-formats code), revert it immediately and mention in Attempt notes.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Avoid pytest or nb-compare full-detector runs; keep ROI tight to curb runtime and artifact size.
- Do not alter scripts/trace_harness.py; instrumentation stays frozen during Evidence loops.
- Ensure `PYTHONPATH=src` comes before `python`; environment order matters when editable install coexists with site-packages.
- Remember `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to prevent MKL crashes; omit it and the run may abort.
- Never delete or rename files referenced in docs/index.md (Protected Assets rule still applies).
- Don’t mix devices mid-run; stick to CPU for trace capture unless plan explicitly requires GPU evidence.
- Do not forget to normalize units when summarizing deltas—report values in meters, not millimetres.
- Refrain from editing docs/fix_plan.md yet; wait until artifacts exist so the Attempt log has concrete numbers.
- Avoid suppressing trace output; we need the full line set for diffing with C traces.
- Keep nb-compare thresholds consistent with prior evidence (≥0.995 ROI correlation) to maintain comparability.
- Do not overwrite older parity summaries; append new sections with dates if additional commentary is needed.
- Prevent accidental `git add` on large binary artifacts; keep them under `reports/` and rely on `.gitignore` policies.

Summary: Capture post-pivot pix0 evidence so normalization work can safely resume.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare_summary.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/metadata.json; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_notes.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6g pix0 trace verification — run "'`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`
If Blocked: Capture the failure stdout/stderr and command in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/attempt_blocked.log`, snapshot `git status` + `python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`, and log Attempt history before exit.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145 lists H6g as the critical gate; without this evidence Phase K remains frozen.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-462 commits Attempt #41 to deliver post-pivot traces, nb-compare smoke, and delta analysis.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log is the C reference we must match to prove the pivot fix is correct in practice.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md still reports |Δpix0|≈1.1 mm; we must overwrite that narrative with measured <5e-5 m deltas.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:1-68 documents implicit pivot rules; our evidence should cite these lines when summarizing findings.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md cannot be regenerated until H6g confirms geometry parity, so this loop unblocks the long-term goal.
- tests/test_cli_flags.py:677-794 already exercises the new pivot forcing; evidence must corroborate those expectations without modifying code.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md captures implementation intent; we need artifacts proving runtime behavior matches that documentation.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 — Prep directory: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix` (do not delete previous phase artifacts).
- Step 1 — Clean env notes: record `date` and `git rev-parse HEAD` to `metadata.json` using a small Python snippet that also logs `sys.version`, `torch.__version__`, `torch.cuda.is_available()`.
- Step 2 — Execute Do Now command; confirm stdout reports `TRACE_PY` entries with SAMPLE pivot and `pix0_before_rotation` values near -0.216476, 0.216343, -0.230192.
- Step 3 — Immediately duplicate the generated log to a timestamped backup (`cp trace_py.log trace_py_$(date +%H%M%S).log`) before editing so raw output is preserved.
- Step 4 — Run unified diff: `diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_diff.txt || true` and inspect for residual lines.
- Step 5 — Compute numerical deltas by scripting: `python - <<'"'PY'"'` to parse both traces, compute per-component differences for pix0, fdet, sdet, odet, close_distance, ratio; persist results into `attempt_notes.md`.
- Step 6 — If any delta exceeds 5e-5 m, repeat harness run after verifying units; otherwise, proceed to nb-compare smoke using the supervisor command arguments (ROI-limited) and store metrics/plots under `post_fix/nb_compare/` with summary entry.
- Step 7 — Update `attempt_notes.md` with precise commands, environment variables, measured deltas, and cross-reference to docs/fix_plan Attempt #41 requirements.
- Step 8 — Before concluding, draft bullet points for docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #41 (metrics, artifacts, first divergence) so the next implementation loop only needs copy/paste.
- Step 9 — Verify no accidental file edits occurred outside `reports/` or documentation by running `git status --short` and reviewing new files.
- Step 10 — If anything unexpected appears (e.g., harness auto-formats code), revert it immediately and mention in Attempt notes.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Avoid pytest or nb-compare full-detector runs; keep ROI tight to curb runtime and artifact size.
- Do not alter scripts/trace_harness.py; instrumentation stays frozen during Evidence loops.
- Ensure `PYTHONPATH=src` comes before `python`; environment order matters when editable install coexists with site-packages.
- Remember `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to prevent MKL crashes; omit it and the run may abort.
- Never delete or rename files referenced in docs/index.md (Protected Assets rule still applies).
- Don’t mix devices mid-run; stick to CPU for trace capture unless plan explicitly requires GPU evidence.
- Do not forget to normalize units when summarizing deltas—report values in meters, not millimetres.
- Refrain from editing docs/fix_plan.md yet; wait until artifacts exist so the Attempt log has concrete numbers.
- Avoid suppressing trace output; we need the full line set for diffing with C traces.
- Keep nb-compare thresholds consistent with prior evidence (≥0.995 ROI correlation) to maintain comparability.
- Do not overwrite older parity summaries; append new sections with dates if additional commentary is needed.
- Prevent accidental `git add` on large binary artifacts; keep them under `reports/` and rely on `.gitignore` policies.

- docs/fix_plan.md:448-462 — Active item scope, status, and Next Actions for Attempt #41.

 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.

-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.

# Phase H6c Findings: First Divergence Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Phase:** H6c Trace Diff Analysis
**Objective:** Identify first divergence between C and PyTorch pix0 traces

## Summary

**First Divergence Identified:** `beam_center_m` values differ by a factor of ~10³ (millimeters vs meters)

### Critical Finding

The C trace shows:
```
TRACE_C:beam_center_m=Xclose:0.000211818 Yclose:0.000217322 pixel_mm:0.172
```

The PyTorch trace shows:
```

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
     Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

+- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
 - Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

+- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so list now centers on H6g verification → K2 scaling-chain rerun → K3 regression test → Phase L gating.
+- Coin flip → tails, so skipped historical commit audit; focused on evidence planning.
+- Authored new `input.md` (Evidence phase) instructing Ralph to rerun the trace harness with pivot fix, capture diff vs C trace, compute deltas, run ROI nb-compare, and prepare Attempt #41 notes; memo also emphasises no pytest this loop.
+- Key gap notes: normalization tasks K2/K3 still blocked pending H6g; vectorization plan untouched (Phase A baseline scripts outstanding).

-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

Context Recap:
- Attempt #40 confirmed SAMPLE pivot forcing when custom detector basis vectors are present (docs/fix_plan.md:448-462).
- Phase H6g remains open in plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145; |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m is the go/no-go threshold.
- Scaling-chain refresh (Phase K2) and regression test (Phase K3) are blocked until H6g artifacts land.
- Previous trace analysis (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/analysis.md) highlighted unit logging mismatches; ensure they do not recur.
- Pivot fix documentation (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md) expects runtime confirmation that pix0 now aligns with C trace values.
- Long-term goal #1 depends on executing the supervisor command parity run; we must clear this evidence gate first.

Evidence Capture Checklist:
1. Ensure working tree clean except for reports (`git status --short`).
2. Create post-fix directory: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix`.
3. Record timestamp + commit hash: `date >> .../env_snapshot.txt` and `git rev-parse HEAD >> env_snapshot.txt`.
4. Append Python environment info to env snapshot using `python - <<'"'PY'"'` (collect `sys.version`, `torch.__version__`, `torch.cuda.is_available()`, `torch.get_default_dtype()`).
5. Document CUDA device name if available: `python - <<'"'PY'"'` printing `torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)` (guard with availability).
6. Confirm NB_C_BIN points at golden binary: `echo $NB_C_BIN >> env_snapshot.txt`; if unset note that harness relies solely on trace and not live nb-compare yet.
7. Run the Do Now harness command (ensuring `PYTHONPATH=src` comes first) and verify `TRACE_PY:detector_convention=CUSTOM` appears.
8. Immediately copy raw trace to a timestamped backup (`cp trace_py.log trace_py_$(date +%H%M%S).log`) to preserve untouched output.
9. Normalize line endings if needed using `dos2unix` (only if carriage returns appear; otherwise skip).
10. Perform diff vs C trace: `diff -u .../trace_c_pix0.log .../trace_py.log > .../trace_diff.txt` (allow non-zero exit).
11. Inspect diff for `beam_center_m` lines; they should now match numerical magnitudes (meters not millimetres).
12. Write a small python delta script to compute absolute differences for pix0 components, Fclose/Sclose, close_distance, r_factor, basis vectors; store metrics JSON.
13. Summarize numeric results in `attempt_notes.md` with bullet list (include per-axis delta in meters and micrometers).
14. If any delta exceeds 5e-5 m, rerun harness after investigating units; add failed attempt details to notes before retrying.
15. Once diff clean, run ROI nb-compare to ensure visual parity: `nb-compare --roi 1000 1100 600 700 --resample --threshold 0.995 --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0`.
16. Capture nb-compare stdout and metrics into `nb_compare_summary.md`; store JSON output in `nb_compare/metrics.json` if available.
17. Take note of correlation, sum_ratio, rmse, and peak alignment; highlight any deviations >1e-3.
18. Append ROI selection rationale (why 1000-1100,600-700) and mention that full-frame parity will follow during Phase L.
19. Update `attempt_notes.md` with references to all generated files, command strings, environment snapshot, and measured deltas.
20. Draft bullet list for docs/fix_plan Attempt #41 (Metrics, Artifacts, Observations, Next Actions) while results are fresh.
21. Review `git status --short` to confirm only reports, input.md, and docs edits appear; no source files should change in this loop.
22. If nb-compare script produced PNGs, ensure they reside inside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare/` and are referenced in summary.
23. Verify `trace_diff.txt` is empty or only contains header lines; if not, investigate mismatched lines and annotate cause in notes.
24. Check that `metadata.json` contains all keys (timestamp, git_hash, sys_version, torch_version, cuda_available, device_name if applicable).
25. Leave TODO comment in `attempt_notes.md` specifying whether scaling-chain refresh can proceed in next loop.

Metrics to Record:
- Absolute pix0 deltas (fast, slow, close) in meters and micrometers.
- Fclose/Sclose, close_distance, and ratio differences to confirm no regression.
- nb-compare correlation, RMSE, sum_ratio, and peak distance for the ROI run.
- Execution time for trace harness (helps detect future performance regressions).
- Whether torch.cuda.is_available() and, if true, device name.
- Any warnings emitted by trace harness or nb-compare.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit detector/crystal code; Evidence loop should only read + record.
- Skip pytest entirely; Evidence phase forbids running unit tests.
- Ensure `nb-compare` uses ROI to avoid generating multi-hundred-MB artifacts.
- Double-check environment variables; missing `PYTHONPATH=src` will import old wheel build.
- Avoid mixing units in notes—always express deltas in meters first, with micrometer equivalents in parentheses.
- No manual edits to C trace file; treat it as read-only reference.
- Do not overwrite existing parity summaries; append new section with date 2025-10-06.
- Ensure Attempt logging happens after evidence captured, not before.
- Guard against accidentally adding binary artifacts to git (verify `.gitignore` covers outputs).
- Do not remove earlier attempt directories; future audits rely on complete history.
- Keep harness patch intact; do not disable tracing prints to shorten output.

Attempt Log Template (for docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #41):
- Date / Loop index.
- Result summary (PASS/FAIL, include |Δpix0| values).
- Metrics: pix0 deltas, nb-compare correlation/sum_ratio/RMSE/peak distance.
- Artifacts list: trace files, diff, metadata, nb-compare outputs, attempt notes.
- Observations/Hypotheses: comment on residual deltas or confirm alignment.
- Next Actions: likely K2 scaling-chain rerun, K3 pytest command, or remedial debugging if parity still off.

Reporting Reminders:
- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with a new section referencing post-fix deltas.
- Consider adding a short note to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` indicating evidence pending H6g (if not already documented).
- Keep copy of commands in `attempt_notes.md` for reproducibility.

10. Perform diff vs C trace: `diff -u .../trace_c_pix0.log .../trace_py.log > .../trace_diff.txt` (allow non-zero exit).
11. Inspect diff for `beam_center_m` lines; they should now match numerical magnitudes (meters not millimetres).
12. Write a small python delta script to compute absolute differences for pix0 components, Fclose/Sclose, close_distance, r_factor, basis vectors; store metrics JSON.
13. Summarize numeric results in `attempt_notes.md` with bullet list (include per-axis delta in meters and micrometers).
14. If any delta exceeds 5e-5 m, rerun harness after investigating units; add failed attempt details to notes before retrying.
15. Once diff clean, run ROI nb-compare to ensure visual parity: `nb-compare --roi 1000 1100 600 700 --resample --threshold 0.995 --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0`.
16. Capture nb-compare stdout and metrics into `nb_compare_summary.md`; store JSON output in `nb_compare/metrics.json` if available.
17. Take note of correlation, sum_ratio, rmse, and peak alignment; highlight any deviations >1e-3.
18. Append ROI selection rationale (why 1000-1100,600-700) and mention that full-frame parity will follow during Phase L.
19. Update `attempt_notes.md` with references to all generated files, command strings, environment snapshot, and measured deltas.
20. Draft bullet list for docs/fix_plan Attempt #41 (Metrics, Artifacts, Observations, Next Actions) while results are fresh.
21. Review `git status --short` to confirm only reports, input.md, and docs edits appear; no source files should change in this loop.
22. If nb-compare script produced PNGs, ensure they reside inside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/nb_compare/` and are referenced in summary.
23. Verify `trace_diff.txt` is empty or only contains header lines; if not, investigate mismatched lines and annotate cause in notes.
24. Check that `metadata.json` contains all keys (timestamp, git_hash, sys_version, torch_version, cuda_available, device_name if applicable).
25. Leave TODO comment in `attempt_notes.md` specifying whether scaling-chain refresh can proceed in next loop.

Metrics to Record:
- Absolute pix0 deltas (fast, slow, close) in meters and micrometers.
- Fclose/Sclose, close_distance, and ratio differences to confirm no regression.
- nb-compare correlation, RMSE, sum_ratio, and peak distance for the ROI run.
- Execution time for trace harness (helps detect future performance regressions).
- Whether torch.cuda.is_available() and, if true, device name.
- Any warnings emitted by trace harness or nb-compare.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit detector/crystal code; Evidence loop should only read + record.
- Skip pytest entirely; Evidence phase forbids running unit tests.
- Ensure `nb-compare` uses ROI to avoid generating multi-hundred-MB artifacts.
- Double-check environment variables; missing `PYTHONPATH=src` will import old wheel build.
- Avoid mixing units in notes—always express deltas in meters first, with micrometer equivalents in parentheses.
- No manual edits to C trace file; treat it as read-only reference.
- Do not overwrite existing parity summaries; append new section with date 2025-10-06.
- Ensure Attempt logging happens after evidence captured, not before.
- Guard against accidentally adding binary artifacts to git (verify `.gitignore` covers outputs).
- Do not remove earlier attempt directories; future audits rely on complete history.
- Keep harness patch intact; do not disable tracing prints to shorten output.

Attempt Log Template (for docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #41):
- Date / Loop index.
- Result summary (PASS/FAIL, include |Δpix0| values).
- Metrics: pix0 deltas, nb-compare correlation/sum_ratio/RMSE/peak distance.
- Artifacts list: trace files, diff, metadata, nb-compare outputs, attempt notes.
- Observations/Hypotheses: comment on residual deltas or confirm alignment.
- Next Actions: likely K2 scaling-chain rerun, K3 pytest command, or remedial debugging if parity still off.

Reporting Reminders:
- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with a new section referencing post-fix deltas.
- Consider adding a short note to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` indicating evidence pending H6g (if not already documented).
- Keep copy of commands in `attempt_notes.md` for reproducibility.

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
     Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
 - Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
+- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present.

+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

+- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so list now centers on H6g verification → K2 scaling-chain rerun → K3 regression test → Phase L gating.
+- Coin flip → tails, so skipped historical commit audit; focused on evidence planning.
+- Authored new `input.md` (Evidence phase) instructing Ralph to rerun the trace harness with pivot fix, capture diff vs C trace, compute deltas, run ROI nb-compare, and prepare Attempt #41 notes; memo also emphasises no pytest this loop.
+- Key gap notes: normalization tasks K2/K3 still blocked pending H6g; vectorization plan untouched (Phase A baseline scripts outstanding).

 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
     Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
 - Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
     Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

+- `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` returned "Already up to date"; no conflicts encountered.
+- Reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 entry (`docs/fix_plan.md:448-462`) and Phase H6 table (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:131-145`); confirmed Attempt #40 landed pivot forcing but H6g artifacts remain outstanding.
+- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` context with Attempt #40 recap and marked H6f as `[D]`; rewrote H6g guidance to require post-fix trace + nb-compare artifacts under `reports/…/phase_h6/post_fix/` and to log Attempt #41.
+- Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions so list now centers on H6g verification → K2 scaling-chain rerun → K3 regression test → Phase L gating.
+- Coin flip → tails, so skipped historical commit audit; focused on evidence planning.
+- Authored new `input.md` (Evidence phase) instructing Ralph to rerun the trace harness with pivot fix, capture diff vs C trace, compute deltas, run ROI nb-compare, and prepare Attempt #41 notes; memo also emphasises no pytest this loop.
+- Key gap notes: normalization tasks K2/K3 still blocked pending H6g; vectorization plan untouched (Phase A baseline scripts outstanding).
+- Follow-up for Ralph: execute H6g evidence capture, archive artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`, then log Attempt #41 in `docs/fix_plan.md` with measured |Δpix0| before touching normalization.

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**

**Summarizing final response plan**

I'm putting together a thorough final message that explains recent plan updates and memo prep, analyzes the codebase tied to long-term goals with file line references, lays out debugging hypotheses ranked by confidence with next steps, notes the coin flip outcome and skipped commit review, and suggests clear numbered next actions—all while following formatting rules and including relevant file citations.
[2025-10-06T19:57:30] codex

Updated the CLI parity planning artifacts so everything now points at H6g evidence capture after the SAMPLE-pivot fix landed. `docs/fix_plan.md` and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` both now call out Attempt #41 as the next gate, and the new 100‑line `input.md` memo instructs Ralph to rerun the trace harness and archive fresh pix0 parity data.

**Findings**
- H6f is marked complete and the CLI plan now requires pivot-verified traces under `reports/…/phase_h6/post_fix/` before touching normalization (plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:143, plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:144).
- The fix plan’s Next Actions list is refreshed to emphasise H6g → K2 → K3 sequencing prior to any supervisor command reruns (docs/fix_plan.md:451, docs/fix_plan.md:459).
- The Evidence-phase steering memo captures the full H6g checklist, including env snapshots, diffing, ROI nb-compare, and Attempt‑log prep (input.md:1, input.md:7, input.md:33, input.md:79).
- Vectorization remains untouched; Phase A baseline work is still blank across all tasks (plans/active/vectorization.md:13, plans/active/vectorization.md:24).
- Coin flip came up tails, so no audit of Ralph’s recent commits was performed this loop (galph_memory.md:142).

**Hypotheses**
- Residual pix0 deltas were driven by trace logging in millimetres; the pivot fix should drop |Δpix0| below 5e‑5 m once the harness is rerun with the new config (confidence: medium). Next step: execute the Do Now trace command and diff against `trace_c_pix0.log`.
- If any axis still exceeds tolerance, the harness may be reusing cached detector geometry from earlier runs (confidence: low). Next step: reinstantiate `Detector` inside the harness after clearing module-level caches to confirm whether deltas persist.

**Next Steps**
1. Follow the Evidence memo to capture H6g artifacts (trace, diff, metrics, ROI nb-compare).
2. Log Attempt #41 in `docs/fix_plan.md` with measured deltas and update `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` once evidence is green.
3. Prepare the command list for Phase K2 so normalization tracing can start immediately after H6g passes.

Tests: not run (planning-only loop).

 ## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
 - Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
 - Priority: High
-- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
+- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; pivot fix landed via H6f, pending H6g traces + Phase K normalization)
 - Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
 - Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-06 refresh): Pivot evidence (H6e) is complete; concentrate on enforcement + cleanup before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Phase H6f-prep — relocate the parity visuals (`img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` (update references in `pivot_parity.md` and parity_summary) so follow-up attempts keep artifacts under `reports/`.
-  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
-  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #40 in this ledger.
-  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
-  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
-  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): Pivot forcing (H6f) is complete; focus on verification + normalization before attempting the supervisor command again:
+  1. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness with the pivot fix (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`), diff against the C trace, and require |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m. Store artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/`, execute the nb-compare smoke in the same directory, and log Attempt #41 in this ledger.
+  2. Phase K2 — once pix0 parity is confirmed, regenerate the scaling-chain analysis with the refreshed PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` plus Attempt history.
+  3. Phase K3 — run the targeted scaling regression (`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`), archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and revise `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` lattice-factor notes as needed.
+  4. Phase L gating — only after K2/K3 evidence is green should Ralph rerun the full supervisor command parity sweep and close the plan; keep normalization blocked until H6g/K2 artifacts land.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
     Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

 - Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.

Outstanding work: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present.
