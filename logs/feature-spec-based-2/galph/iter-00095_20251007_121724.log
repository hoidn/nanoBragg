review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-18): Phase A1–A3 evidence captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (pytest logs plus tricubic/absorption baselines). **Phase B design memo landed in Attempt #3 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) covering tensor shapes, polynomial mapping, and gradient/device checklists.** Next blocker is executing Phase C implementation tasks using that design as the contract.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-18 → refreshed 2025-11-18b): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now pivots to Phase C execution (tasks C1–C3). Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported, reuse the design memo’s Section 2/3 diagrams, and stage changes behind feature-flag-friendly commits to ease review if batching becomes necessary.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-20): No code changes have landed since the design memo; Phase C remains unstarted. The updated guidance below locks in artifact destinations (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`) and reproduction commands so Ralph can take the first implementation step without further supervisor clarification.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

Goal: Replace scalar neighbor gathering with fully batched advanced indexing inside `Crystal._tricubic_interpolation` while keeping fallbacks for out-of-range queries.
Prereqs: Phase B design finalized; create feature branch per SOP if needed.
Exit Criteria: Vectorized gather merged, unit tests covering neighborhood assembly added, and plan task C1–C3 marked done with artifact references.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-20 refresh → updated by galph):
 1. Phase L3j.1 — Update `mosflm_matrix_correction.md` with Attempt #93 evidence (H3 ruled out, H5–H7 promoted) and cite the relevant trace line numbers plus φ sampling requirements.
 2. Phase L3j.2 — Draft `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md` listing per-φ trace, targeted pytest (`tests/test_cli_scaling.py -k lattice -v`), and nb-compare ROI commands with ≤1e-6 tolerances and artifact paths.
 3. Phase L3j.3 — Refresh docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history once the checklist exists and log the evidence paths before scheduling simulator code changes.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #91 (ralph loop i=91) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L3g spindle instrumentation COMPLETE). **H1 (spindle normalization) RULED OUT as root cause of Y-drift.**
    Metrics: Spindle Δ(magnitude)=0.0 (tolerance ≤5e-4); trace captured 43 TRACE_PY lines (was 40, +3 spindle lines); test collection 4/4 passed.
    Artifacts:

**Summarizing current codebase challenges and next steps**

I’m outlining key issues around the CLI command goals—especially about gettings -nonoise and -pix0 flags working with scaling and reflection handling—and noting where gaps remain like the F_cell loading problem. Then I’ll move on to flipping the coin in Python to decide if I review Ralph’s work next. Let’s explore this thoughtfully!

**Assessing task progress and plan alignment**

I’m reviewing unresolved issues in CLI and vectorization tasks, focusing on intensity scaling mismatches and incomplete phase work. I’ll check if the existing plans are current or require updates and gather more details from the fix_plan document to align next steps accordingly.

 2. Execute Phase C2 — add/extend the targeted pytest (`tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire`) to confirm the warning fires once and interpolation disables; store the `pytest -k oob_warning -v` log under `phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.log`.
 3. Execute Phase C3 — add shape assertions + device-aware caching, record findings in `phase_c/implementation_notes.md`, and attach the post-assertion `pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled -v` output as evidence.

**Determining plan update necessity and relevant docs**

I'm weighing whether updates are needed for the CLI and vectorization plans, noticing an inconsistency in fix_plan’s next actions regarding vectorization phases. Given that, it seems updating the vectorization plan and aligning documentation is the right focus. Next, I'll identify and review key design and development docs to support this planning step.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Architecture Design (Addendum)

## 1.2 Differentiability vs Performance

Principle: Differentiability is required; over-hardening is not. Prefer the minimal change that passes gradcheck and preserves vectorization.

- Minimal Differentiability Contract
  - Return analytic limits at removable singularities only when the raw op produces NaN/Inf or unacceptable relative error in tests.
  - Keep the nominal fast path branch-free (or mask-based) and fully vectorized.
  - Avoid speculative guards and extra branches unless backed by (a) a reproduced gradient failure or (b) a measured numerical/perf improvement.

- Branching Budget (Hot Helpers)
  - Per-element branching inside hot helpers (e.g., `sincg`, `sinc3`, polarization) must be justified with numbers (gradcheck evidence or microbenchmark delta).

- Mask vs Guard
  - Masks gate analytic limits; a single epsilon guard may backstop tiny denominators. If the mask tolerance renders guards redundant, prefer the mask alone.

- Precision Guidance
  - Default dev dtype: float64; default prod dtype: float32. Tolerances must state dtype assumptions and be tested in both where relevant.

# PyTorch Runtime Checklist

Use this quick checklist before and after every PyTorch simulator edit. It distills the authoritative guidance from
`docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the testing strategy.

1. **Vectorization**
   - Do not reintroduce Python loops that duplicate work already handled by batched tensor code.
   - When adding a new flow (sources, phi, mosaic, oversample), extend the existing broadcast shapes instead of looping.
   - Verify `_compute_physics_for_position` receives tensors with the expected batch dimensions.

2. **Device & Dtype Neutrality**
   - **Default dtype is float32** for performance and memory efficiency. Precision-critical operations (gradient checks, metric duality) explicitly override to float64 where required.
   - Materialize configuration tensors (beam, detector, crystal) on the execution device before the main loop.
   - Avoid per-iteration `.to()`, `.cpu()`, `.cuda()`, or tensor factories (`torch.tensor(...)`) inside compiled regions; cache constants once.
   - Run CPU **and** CUDA smoke commands (`pytest -v -m gpu_smoke`) when a GPU is available.

3. **torch.compile Hygiene**
   - Watch the console for Dynamo “graph break” warnings; treat them as blockers.
   - Benchmarks should reuse compiled functions; avoid changing shapes every call unless batching logic handles it.

## Executive Summary

This memo defines the tensor shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient/device requirements for vectorizing the tricubic interpolation pipeline in nanoBragg PyTorch. The current scalar-only implementation (≈5.5 ms/call on CUDA, ≈1.4 ms/call on CPU per Phase A baselines) limits performance when processing batched detector pixels. Vectorization will eliminate Python loops over neighborhood gathering and polynomial evaluation, enabling GPU parallelism and torch.compile optimization.

# Phase C1: Batched Neighborhood Gather Implementation Notes

**Date:** 2025-10-17 (ralph loop i=89)
**Plan Reference:** `plans/active/vectorization.md` Phase C, Task C1
**Implementation:** `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` lines 355-410

## Summary

Phase C1 (batched neighborhood gather) has been successfully implemented. The infrastructure builds `(B,4,4,4)` neighborhood tensors using advanced PyTorch indexing as specified in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md` Section 2.

## Implementation Overview

### Before (Scalar Gather)
The previous implementation performed tricubic interpolation one Miller index at a time, requiring a Python loop over all detector pixels. Estimated cost: ~1.4 ms/call × 256×256 pixels = ~92 seconds for a full detector (per Phase A baseline).

### After (Batched Gather)
The new implementation:
1. **Flattens** all input dimensions to a single batch dimension `B`
2. **Builds** coordinate grids for each query point: `(B, 4)` arrays for h, k, and l
3. **Gathers** 4×4×4 neighborhoods using broadcasting pattern:

**Preparing plan update for vectorization**

I’m focusing on updating the plan document to reflect recent progress (C1 done) and outline next steps (C2/C3). I want to carefully revise the gap snapshot with new dates and details while cleaning outdated info, then adjust fix_plan's next actions accordingly. I’ll lean on Python scripting to handle precise file edits, starting by inspecting the plan’s top section to target modifications step-by-step.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-18): Phase A1–A3 evidence captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (pytest logs plus tricubic/absorption baselines). **Phase B design memo landed in Attempt #3 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) covering tensor shapes, polynomial mapping, and gradient/device checklists.** Next blocker is executing Phase C implementation tasks using that design as the contract.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-18 → refreshed 2025-11-18b): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now pivots to Phase C execution (tasks C1–C3). Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported, reuse the design memo’s Section 2/3 diagrams, and stage changes behind feature-flag-friendly commits to ease review if batching becomes necessary.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-20): No code changes have landed since the design memo; Phase C remains unstarted. The updated guidance below locks in artifact destinations (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`) and reproduction commands so Ralph can take the first implementation step without further supervisor clarification.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-21): Phase C1 batched gather is COMPLETE (Attempts #4/#5; artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`). Remaining blockers before polynomial work are C2 (OOB fallback validation) and C3 (shape assertions + device-aware caching).
- Supervisory note (2025-11-21): Keep the Phase B design memo (§2–§4) and `gather_notes.md` as the contract; ensure fix_plan next actions emphasise C2/C3 artifacts landing in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design

I’m also deciding how to handle the `Mode` setting, compiling bullet points for mapped tests, artifacts, fallback, and prioritized references with line approximations to package everything clearly for the input.

  1870	- Risks/Assumptions: Gradient tests use relaxed tolerances (rtol=0.05) due to complex physics simulation chain, validated against existing test_gradients.py comprehensive test suite. New tests must ensure they do not reintroduce long-running simulator invocations. torch.compile bugs may be fixed in future PyTorch versions; re-enable compilation when possible.
  1871	- Exit Criteria (quote thresholds from spec):
  1872	  * testing_strategy.md §4.1: "The following parameters (at a minimum) must pass gradcheck: Crystal: cell_a, cell_gamma, misset_rot_x; Detector: distance_mm, Fbeam_mm; Beam: lambda_A; Model: mosaic_spread_rad, fluence." (⚠️ outstanding: misset_rot_x, lambda_A, fluence still require tests; existing coverage for cell params + beam_center_f remains valid; compilation bugs fixed for existing tests.)

Summary: Document φ-rotation parity evidence so future simulator fixes have a locked checklist and spec citations.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_correction.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md; docs/fix_plan.md; plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect_L3j.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/attempt_notes.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3j.1–L3j.2 — pytest --collect-only -q
If Blocked: Capture a short narrative in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/attempt_notes.md, stash any harness stdout under the same folder, and note the blocker plus file paths in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts for traceability.

Context Recap:
- Attempt #93 proved MOSFLM base vectors align within float32 precision and shifted suspicion to φ rotation (H5) per reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md.
- L3a–L3i tasks are ✅; per-φ traces and spindle audits exist, but no implementation checklist yet guards the upcoming fix.
- The supervisor command relies on phisteps=10, osc=0.1, so φ sampling at 0°, 0.05°, 0.1° captures the full motion envelope.
- docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions still reference L3i instrumentation; updating them prevents future loops from repeating now-complete evidence tasks.
- Long-term Goal #1 (run C vs PyTorch parity command) is blocked until φ rotation parity is restored, making this documentation loop a prerequisite.
- Vectorization backlog is paused; documenting CLI progress clarifies when resources can return to VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001.
- Protected Assets rule demands we leave docs/index.md references untouched; all new content must live in allowed directories (plans/, docs/, reports/).
- Mode Parity forbids running full pytest; only collect-only validation is expected after doc edits.
- Prior evidence loops already generated heavy traces; reuse them, avoid generating new large logs unless absolutely necessary.

Summary: Drive Phase C2 of tricubic vectorization by locking regression coverage for the OOB fallback before moving on to shape assertions.
Mode: Docs
Focus: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Vectorize tricubic interpolation and detector absorption
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire; tests/test_at_str_002.py::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.log; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/implementation_notes.md; reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/status_snapshot.txt; plans/active/vectorization.md; docs/fix_plan.md
Do Now: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase C2 — author "'`tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire` to pin the single-warning behavior, then run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire -v`
If Blocked: Run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py -q`, log the failure plus traceback in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/attempt_notes.md`, and note the blocker under docs/fix_plan.md Attempts.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/vectorization.md:5 — Latest snapshot shows Phase C1 is complete and Phase C2 is the first remaining blocker; executing it keeps the plan on script.
- docs/fix_plan.md:1889 — Next Actions enumerate C2/C3; closing C2 supplies the evidence needed before reshaping caches.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md:52 — Section 2 spells out the `(B,4,4,4)` gather contract that the new test must respect.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/gather_notes.md:63 — Documents current fallback path and warning; leverage those details when codifying the regression.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:105 — Reinforces that targeted pytest selectors and logged outputs are mandatory for Tier 1 parity work.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:1 — Keep device/dtype neutrality explicit while authoring the test and any helper shims.

How-To Map:
- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` around the interpolation warning to capture the exact message and flag state (`_interpolation_warning_shown`).
- Draft `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` (new file if absent) with fixtures that trigger one batched interpolation plus a repeat call to assert the warning fires exactly once and interpolation disables thereafter.
- Capture collection evidence first: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py -q` → save to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.collect.log`.
- After implementing the test, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire -v` and store the verbose log at `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.log`.
- Update `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/status_snapshot.txt` with a short summary (date, git SHA, warning toggle behavior) and extend `implementation_notes.md` with any helper edits needed for deterministic warning capture.
- When satisfied, append Attempt entry under docs/fix_plan.md referencing the new artifacts and mark Phase C2 as complete in plans/active/vectorization.md.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not delete or rename any file referenced in docs/index.md (Protected Assets rule).
- No `.item()` or dtype/device hardcoding inside tests or helpers—respect gradient flow even in assertions.
- Avoid adding ad-hoc scripts; reuse `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/` for logs instead of new directories.
- Keep warning capture deterministic; don’t rely on global stdout without asserting the exact message string.
- Ensure the test leaves global plan state untouched (`Crystal._interpolation_warning_shown` should reset via fixture teardown).
- No broad `pytest -k` sweeps beyond the specified selector without prior supervisor approval.
- Preserve existing Phase C1 artifacts; do not overwrite `gather_notes.md` except to append references if necessary.
- Maintain vectorization — no reintroducing pixel-level Python loops just to exercise the test case.
- Watch for torch.compile graph breaks; report them instead of disabling compile silently.
- Respect repo cleanliness: stage only intentional changes and capture new logs before exiting the loop.

Pointers:
- plans/active/vectorization.md:30 — Phase C task table and artifact expectations.
- docs/fix_plan.md:1889 — Official Next Actions checklist for VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md:122 — Out-of-bounds handling and warning semantics from Phase B design.
- reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/gather_notes.md:92 — Current fallback description plus scalar vs batched behavior notes.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:150 — Targeted pytest and artifact logging conventions.
- docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md:5 — Device/dtype guardrails to cite in implementation notes.

Next Up:
1. Phase C3 — Add shape assertions and device-aware caching once the warning regression is locked.
2. Phase D1 — Begin vectorizing `polint` after C2/C3 evidence is merged and documented.

Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported, reuse the design memo’s Section 2/3 diagrams, and stage changes behind feature-flag-friendly commits to ease review if batching becomes necessary.
-- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-20): No code changes have landed since the design memo; Phase C remains unstarted. The updated guidance below locks in artifact destinations (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`) and reproduction commands so Ralph can take the first implementation step without further supervisor clarification.
+- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-21): Phase C1 batched gather is COMPLETE (Attempts #4/#5; artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`). Remaining blockers before polynomial work are C2 (OOB fallback validation) and C3 (shape assertions + device-aware caching).
+- Supervisory note (2025-11-21): Keep the Phase B design memo (§2–§4) and `gather_notes.md` as the contract; ensure fix_plan next actions emphasise C2/C3 artifacts landing in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`.
 
 ### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
 Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.

-Context Recap:
-- Attempt #93 proved MOSFLM base vectors align within float32 precision and shifted suspicion to φ rotation (H5) per reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md.
-- L3a–L3i tasks are ✅; per-φ traces and spindle audits exist, but no implementation checklist yet guards the upcoming fix.

**Preparing final summary message**

I'll create a clear bullet list summarizing changes with file references, note no tests were run, mention commit and push, and provide enumerated next steps for Ralph to follow in phases C2 and C3.
[2025-10-07T12:23:56] codex

- Captured new snapshot in `plans/active/vectorization.md:5-36` so the plan now records Phase C1 as done and flags C2/C3 as the remaining blockers before polynomial work.
- Realigned `docs/fix_plan.md:1889-1892` Next Actions to call out Phase C2, Phase C3, and the required close-out log instead of repeating already-finished gather work.
- Replaced the supervisor memo (`input.md`) with Docs-mode guidance directing Ralph to author `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire`, run it with the documented selector, and store evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`.
- Logged the decisions and expectations for the next loop in `galph_memory.md:1615-1620`.
- Tests were not run (planning/doc updates only).

Next steps:
1. Ralph executes Phase C2 per the new `input.md`, capturing the targeted pytest log and updating fix_plan attempts.
2. Once C2 evidence lands, move on to Phase C3 (shape assertions + caching) before scheduling Phase D polynomial vectorization.
