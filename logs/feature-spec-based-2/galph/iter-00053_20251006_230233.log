review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: In Evidence, do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence, supervisor-scoped): No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt.
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests in Evidence: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation).
Mode flags: Mode flags are combinable and refine execution within the selected Phase. Keep Phase mutually exclusive.
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When Phase=Evidence, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# nanoBragg Spec A — Core Engine

This shard contains the normative physics, geometry, sampling, and data handling requirements. CLI flag semantics live in [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md); cross-implementation profiles and developer tooling are captured in [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md).

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

# nanoBragg Spec A — Conformance & Parallel Tests

This shard enumerates the CLI profile acceptance tests, parallel validation suite, developer tooling expectations, and conformance profiles. Review [spec-a-core.md](spec-a-core.md) for base requirements and [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md) for CLI semantics referenced here.

Parallel Validation Tests (Profile: C-PyTorch Equivalence) — Acceptance Tests (Normative)

References: ../docs/development/testing_strategy.md (parallel trace-driven validation), ../docs/debugging/debugging.md (trace SOP), ../docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (detector geometry triage), ../docs/architecture/undocumented_conventions.md (hidden C behaviors)
Why: testing_strategy and debugging.md define the parallel trace methodology; the detector checklist accelerates geometry debugging; undocumented_conventions flags hidden C behaviors that often break equivalence.

These tests verify that PyTorch implementation produces outputs equivalent to the C reference implementation. They apply to implementations claiming the C-PyTorch Equivalence Profile. These are black-box behavioral tests comparing outputs without examining internal implementation details.

- AT-PARALLEL-001 Beam Center Scales with Detector Size
  - Setup: Test detector sizes 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024 pixels with 0.1mm pixel size, cubic crystal 100Å N=3, λ=6.2Å
  - Expectation: Beam center (mm) SHALL equal detector_pixels/2 × pixel_size_mm; Peak SHALL appear at detector center ±2 pixels; Correlation between C and PyTorch ≥0.9999
  - Failure mode: Fixed beam center at 51.2mm regardless of detector size
  - Implementation:

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
 - Next Actions (2025-11-08 refresh):
  1. Phase K3f4 — Append a “Root Cause” section to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` capturing the MOSFLM volume/rescale gap and outline the fix path; propagate the note into plan ⟶ docs/fix_plan (done once summary updated).
  2. Phase K3g1/K3g2 — Implement the MOSFLM real-vector rebuild in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (derive `V_cell`, real vectors, and updated reciprocal duals from the supplied A* matrix) and land the accompanying regression test under `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` (or sibling). Reference nanoBragg.c lines 3135-3210 in the code docstring per Core Rule #11.
  3. Phase K3g3 (then K3c) — Re-run scaling evidence with `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, refresh `phase_k/f_latt_fix/` artifacts + nb-compare, and close Attempt #46 once Δh/Δk/Δl < 5e-4 and F_latt parity holds.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).
    Artifacts:

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-06): Traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) show the SAMPLE pivot fix leaves residual close-distance deltas (~2.8 µm), which push the fractional Miller index from 2.0012 (C) to 1.9993 (PyTorch). Those 0.002 shifts around integer values amplify sincg results (F_latt_b ≈ +21.6%). Need dtype diagnostics to confirm float32 rounding vs geometry formula drift before coding a fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-07): dtype sweep (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/dtype_sweep/`) rules out precision and exposes a φ-grid mismatch—PyTorch logs `k≈1.9997` (φ=0°) while C logs `k≈1.9928` (φ=0.09°). Next action: capture per-φ traces to align sampling before rerunning normalization tests.
- Diagnostic note (2025-11-08 galph audit): `scripts/trace_per_phi.py` currently subtracts `pix0_vector` from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`, yielding plane-relative vectors instead of sample-to-pixel paths. Fix this double subtraction in the Phase K3f PyTorch harness before recording new parity traces.
- Gap confirmation (2025-11-08 trace diff): Phase K3f base-lattice traces show PyTorch keeps the placeholder unit cell volume (`V≈1 Å^3`) when MOSFLM vectors are supplied, so `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` fails to rescale the real vectors. C multiplies `b*×c*` by `V_cell≈2.4682×10^4 Å^3` before converting to meters, yielding |a|≈26.75 Å; PyTorch leaves |a|≈5.8×10^3 Å, which in turn inflates h/k/l by ≈6 units. Fix requires mirroring the MOSFLM derivation pipeline in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (see `specs/spec-a-core.md` Geometry + `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` 3135-3210).
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

    [CLI-FLAGS-003] K3g1: MOSFLM cell rescale implementation
    
    Implement MOSFLM cell volume and real-vector computation from reciprocal matrices.
    
    When MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are provided via -mat files, PyTorch now:
    1. Computes V_star = a* · (b* × c*) from MOSFLM vectors
    2. Derives V_cell = 1 / V_star (in Å³)
    3. Computes real vectors: a = (b* × c*) × V_cell, etc.
    4. Updates cell_a/b/c parameters from derived magnitudes
    
    Previously, PyTorch kept placeholder V=1 Å³ when MOSFLM matrices were supplied,
    causing 40.5× reciprocal vector errors and 405,149× real vector errors.
    
    Changes:
    - src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:694-756
      Added MOSFLM branch in compute_cell_tensors() with full C-code reference

    Metrics: Evidence-only loop. Float32 and float64 produce nearly identical results: F_latt_b=2.33 (both dtypes), vs C F_latt_b=38.63 → 93.98% error for both. Float64 improves F_latt precision by only 0.39% (relative dtype error 3.86e-01%), ruling out rounding as the root cause. Miller index precision: h_frac Δ=1.09e-06 (4.12e-06% error), k_frac Δ=1.38e-07 (1.40e-06% error), l_frac Δ=4.13e-06 (3.73e-05% error).

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Dtype precision ruled out:** Both float32 and float64 produce F_latt_b ≈ 2.33, which is 16.6× smaller than C's 38.63. This is a systematic error, not a precision issue.
      - **Miller index precision excellent:** Fractional h/k/l precision is 6-7 orders of magnitude better than needed, ruling out index rounding errors.
      - **F_latt component precision adequate:** Float64 improves F_latt by < 0.4%, negligible compared to the 93.98% systematic error.
      - **Root cause remains:** Geometric/orientation discrepancy (likely MOSFLM rescaling mismatch per Phase K2b) is the driver, not numerical precision.
      - **Phase K3a still critical:** The MOSFLM rescale guard is the next blocking step; dtype sweep confirms this is the right path.
    Next Actions: **Phase K3a remains blocking** - implement MOSFLM rescale guard per plan.md task, then rerun dtype sweep to verify F_latt_b moves closer to C's 38.63. If still divergent after K3a, investigate MOSFLM → real-space conversion formula and reciprocal vector recalculation sequence (CLAUDE.md Rule #13).
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #45 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase K3e per-φ Miller index parity). **Root cause identified: fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch (Δk≈6.0 at all φ steps), NOT a φ-sampling offset.**
    Metrics: Evidence-only loop. Per-φ traces captured for pixel (133, 134) across φ ∈ [0°, 0.1°] with 10 steps. C reports k_frac≈−3.857 (constant across all φ) while PyTorch reports k_frac≈−9.899 (varying −9.899 to −9.863). Δk≈6.042 at φ=0°, persists at all φ_tic=0…9. ΔF_latt_b ranges 0.27–1.91. First divergence occurs at φ_tic=0, ruling out φ-grid mismatch as the root cause.

    Artifacts: None — findings recorded in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (Phase 3 notes) and galph_memory.md (2025-10-06 loop AS entry).
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #2 — Result: regression. Discovered automation script once again runs `prompts/main.md` inside a fixed loop, violating routing guard and spamming `git push`. Plan rebooted (now archived at `plans/archive/routing-loop-guard/plan.md`) with Phase A tasks pending at the time.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #37 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6b PyTorch trace harness instrumented). **PyTorch pix0 trace captured with TRACE_PY lines matching C format.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #39 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase H6e pivot parity proof). **Confirmed C uses SAMPLE pivot while PyTorch defaults to BEAM pivot for supervisor command.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #40 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase H6f complete). **Custom detector basis vectors now force SAMPLE pivot matching C behavior.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #41 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase H6g complete). **pix0 alignment validated; max delta 2.85 μm << 50 μm threshold.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #42 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase K2/K2b). **Critical finding: MOSFLM rescaling is NOT the root cause of F_latt_b error.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #44 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase K3d dtype sensitivity). **Dtype precision NOT root cause of F_latt_b discrepancy.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #45 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase K3e per-φ Miller index parity). **Root cause identified: fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch (Δk≈6.0 at all φ steps), NOT a φ-sampling offset.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #46 (ralph) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase K3f base lattice traces). **First divergence: reciprocal vectors scaled 40.51× too large.**
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #29 (ralph loop) — Result: Phase H5a EVIDENCE-ONLY COMPLETE. **C-code pix0 override behavior with custom vectors documented.**
      - **PyTorch status (2025-10-06 snapshot):** Implementation skipped override in the custom-vector path, matching this interpretation.
    Update 2025-10-21: superseded by refreshed C traces showing the override DOES apply with custom vectors; the 2025-10-06 instrumentation reused the derived Fbeam/Sbeam so the runs appeared identical. See Attempt #29 (2025-10-21) for corrected evidence.
    Update 2025-10-22: Fresh evidence collection (Attempt #30) **re-confirms 2025-10-06 finding**. WITH and WITHOUT override runs produce IDENTICAL geometry (pix0=-0.216476 m, Fbeam=0.217889 m, Sbeam=0.215043 m). The 2025-10-21 claim is not supported by fresh C traces. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` for authoritative dot-product derivation proving override is ignored when custom vectors are present.
      - **Re-confirms 2025-10-06 evidence:** C ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom detector vectors are supplied
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #5 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase D3 evidence). Executed intensity gap analysis per supervisor directive.
  * [2025-10-06] Phase E Complete (ralph) — Result: success. **First divergence identified: pix0_vector mismatch at line 1 of trace.**

**Reviewing computation and plan consistency**

I'm checking if the implementation in commit 46 fully addresses the K3g tasks in the plan, especially updates to computation of real vectors, volume, and tensor properties in the CrystalConfig. I'm also verifying that attribute mutations like `self.cell_a` maintain tensor consistency and gradient flow, and considering potential issues in the MOSFLM branch with placeholder values and subsequent calls. I want to confirm test resources like `A.mat` exist to validate the new test.

I see the existing log is outdated with incorrect values, and it looks like a new log might not have been produced yet after the recent commit. I'll need to evaluate that commit to confirm if the logs were updated and consider instructing the team to produce fresh logs if needed. Meanwhile, I’m organizing the plan to analyze recent attempts and decide if any adjustments or new plans are required, including a review of the vectorization plan and ongoing CLI enhancements like the `-nonoise` flag functionality.

OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.

**Summarizing progress and planning updates**

I'm reviewing the recent fix and confirming matching values, noting that the base-lattice issue is resolved but some verifications remain, like re-running traces and scaling tests. Next, I’m preparing to update the fix plan and documentation to record progress—marking tasks as done, adding a new attempt entry, and adjusting focus to the CLI-FLAGS-003 issue based on recent commits. I’ll also verify attempt numbers and consider organizing new report artifacts to keep everything clear and up to date.

**Summarizing progress and planning updates**

I'm preparing a detailed attempt entry documenting commit 46’s results and the new test verifying cell vectors, marking relevant tasks as done in the plan, and updating docs to reflect the latest status. I’m also formulating hypotheses on residual discrepancies and planning next steps like rerunning scaling tests. To keep evidence clear, I intend to save script outputs in a new reports directory, ensuring the plan and summary files capture all new findings and guidance for upcoming work.

**Updating plan with task statuses and root cause details**

I'm updating the plan file to mark tasks K3g1 and K3g2 as done while leaving K3g3 open. I’m carefully considering whether to mark K3f4 done since we appended a summary but may need to explicitly mention the root cause and fix outline. I'll add a clear note explaining the root cause regarding the placeholder volume issue and reference the relevant commit to ensure clarity.

I'm making sure the K3f4 task is marked as done by changing its state to `[D]` in the plan and updating the `docs/fix_plan.md` file's "Next Actions" section accordingly. I'll script these edits in Python to handle the table updates cleanly and ensure the linked guidance reflects the latest fix.

[2025-10-06T23:24:17] bash -lc "sed -n '1,80p' plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md" succeeded in 682ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-06): Traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) show the SAMPLE pivot fix leaves residual close-distance deltas (~2.8 µm), which push the fractional Miller index from 2.0012 (C) to 1.9993 (PyTorch). Those 0.002 shifts around integer values amplify sincg results (F_latt_b ≈ +21.6%). Need dtype diagnostics to confirm float32 rounding vs geometry formula drift before coding a fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-07): dtype sweep (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/dtype_sweep/`) rules out precision and exposes a φ-grid mismatch—PyTorch logs `k≈1.9997` (φ=0°) while C logs `k≈1.9928` (φ=0.09°). Next action: capture per-φ traces to align sampling before rerunning normalization tests.
- Diagnostic note (2025-11-08 galph audit): `scripts/trace_per_phi.py` currently subtracts `pix0_vector` from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`, yielding plane-relative vectors instead of sample-to-pixel paths. Fix this double subtraction in the Phase K3f PyTorch harness before recording new parity traces.
- Gap confirmation (2025-11-08 trace diff): Phase K3f base-lattice traces show PyTorch keeps the placeholder unit cell volume (`V≈1 Å^3`) when MOSFLM vectors are supplied, so `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` fails to rescale the real vectors. C multiplies `b*×c*` by `V_cell≈2.4682×10^4 Å^3` before converting to meters, yielding |a|≈26.75 Å; PyTorch leaves |a|≈5.8×10^3 Å, which in turn inflates h/k/l by ≈6 units. Fix requires mirroring the MOSFLM derivation pipeline in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (see `specs/spec-a-core.md` Geometry + `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` 3135-3210).
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).

### Phase F — Detector Implementation (beam + pix0 parity)
Goal: Port CUSTOM detector wiring so CLI overrides reproduce C behavior without ad-hoc harness patches.
Prereqs: Phase E traces complete; docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log captures pix0/beam/orientation findings.
Exit Criteria: Detector trace matches C for pix0 and incident beam; CLI parity run no longer relies on manual overrides.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Thread `custom_beam_vector` through Detector | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05 (ralph): Refactored `_calculate_pix0_vector()` to use `self.beam_vector` property instead of hardcoded beam vectors (lines 438-440, 519-521). Beam vector now exactly matches C trace. Artifacts in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/`. See docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #11. |
| F2 | Port CUSTOM pix0 transform for overrides | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: CUSTOM pathway from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 ported (pivot override, MOSFLM vs CUSTOM offsets, close_distance recompute). Validation report at `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt`. Follow-up: ensure downstream uses keep `close_distance` as a tensor (no `.item()` detaches) when further tuning detector gradients. |
| F3 | Re-run Phase C2 parity smoke | [P] | 2025-10-17 Attempt #12 captured C vs PyTorch artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`; correlation ≈−5e-06 confirms geometry still diverges. Defer rerun until Phase G (A* orientation) lands so parity failure isn’t repeated; once orientation is wired, rerun parity and refresh metrics. |

### Phase G — MOSFLM Matrix Orientation Support
Goal: Preserve full crystal orientation from `-mat` files so PyTorch matches C lattice vectors and downstream physics.
Prereqs: Detector parity (Phase F) achieved or at least traced; clarity on orientation data flow.

- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
- Attempts History: None — new item.
- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
 - Next Actions (2025-11-08 refresh):
  1. Phase K3f4 — Append a “Root Cause” section to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` capturing the MOSFLM volume/rescale gap and outline the fix path; propagate the note into plan ⟶ docs/fix_plan (done once summary updated).

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Critical finding:** C k_frac is CONSTANT (−3.857) across all φ steps while PyTorch k_frac VARIES (−9.899 → −9.863). This indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ fundamentally before ANY φ rotation is applied.
      - **φ-sampling ruled out:** The supervisor steering hypothesis of a φ-grid mismatch is incorrect. The 6-unit k offset exists at φ=0° where no rotation has occurred yet.
      - **Likely root causes:** (1) MOSFLM matrix loading produces different a_star/b_star/c_star, (2) reciprocal→real conversion differs, or (3) scattering vector S calculation uses different geometry.
      - **Plan pivot required:** Phase K3f must now debug base lattice vectors (compare a_star/b_star/c_star from MOSFLM matrix loading, verify reciprocal→real formula, trace a/b/c before φ rotation) instead of φ-sampling adjustments.
    Next Actions: **Phase K3f redirected** - Compare base lattice vectors between C and PyTorch: (1) Log MOSFLM a_star/b_star/c_star after matrix loading, (2) Trace reciprocal→real conversion (cell_a/b/c calculation), (3) Log a/b/c vectors BEFORE φ rotation, (4) Verify scattering vector S = (d - i)/λ uses identical geometry. Once base lattice parity achieved, regenerate scaling-chain memo and confirm Δk<5e-4 at all φ steps.

Summary: Confirm MOSFLM rescale fix by rerunning the scaling parity test and refreshing evidence.
- Phase: Validation
- Mode: Parity
- Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003
- Branch: feature/spec-based-2
- Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c
- Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 — run "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`
If Blocked: Capture fresh `trace_py.log` with the Phase K3f harness and log the failure details under phase_k/f_latt_fix/attempts.md.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md K3g table calls for rerunning scaling after MOSFLM rescale; we just marked K3g1/K3g2 done.
- docs/fix_plan.md CLI-FLAGS-003 entry (2025-11-08 update) cites K3g3 as the remaining blocker before Phase L.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md ensures `-pix0_vector_mm` + MOSFLM semantics; scaling parity must pass before the supervisor command can succeed.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md now records the fix and expects regenerated traces.
How-To Map:
- Export env vars: `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
- Run Do Now command from repo root; then rerun `nb-compare --c-bin $NB_C_BIN -- -mat A.mat ...` using the supervisor CLI (store metrics under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/nb_compare_post_fix/`).
- After the pytest run, refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md` with new Δh/Δk/Δl values and note parity metrics (corr, sum_ratio).
- Regenerate `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/trace_py.log` via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/trace_harness.py --out .../post_fix/trace_py.log` and diff against C.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not skip `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` when importing torch.
- Keep vectorization intact—no Python loops added in scaling paths.
- Maintain device neutrality; avoid `.cpu()` casts in new diagnostics.
- Leave `input.md` untouched after reading instructions.
- Do not delete or rename files referenced in docs/index.md (e.g., loop.sh, input.md).
- Capture artifacts under the documented `reports/` tree, not /tmp.
- When running pytest, stick to the mapped selector—no full suite this loop.
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md (Phase K3g)
- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 attempts #46–47)
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/cell_tensors_py.txt
- tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestFlattSquareMatchesC
Next Up: If scaling parity passes quickly, queue Phase L1 nb-compare run for the supervisor command.

**Expanding file to target length**

I need to expand the file to reach about 100–200 lines since it's currently only around 30 lines. To do this, I'll elaborate on each section with more detailed bullet points, add line breaks, and structure content into multi-line lists with indentation so it becomes longer and more comprehensive. This way, the file will meet the requested length and offer richer guidance.

If Blocked: Capture a fresh Phase K3f trace (`trace_py.log`) and log the failure context under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/attempts.md` so we can diagnose before touching code.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase K3g states the scaling parity rerun is the critical gate after 46ba36b landed; the plan now marks K3g1/K3g2 done, leaving K3g3 outstanding.
- docs/fix_plan.md CLI-FLAGS-003 section (Attempt #47) records the MOSFLM branch validation and explicitly lists K3g3 as the next action before Phase L.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md §Interpolation/Normalization still governs the acceptance thresholds; we must verify Δh/Δk/Δl < 5e-4 and the intensity sum ratio stays within 1% before executing the supervisor nb-compare command.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md now cites the placeholder-volume root cause as resolved; the remaining evidence gap is updated scaling and nb-compare data.
- Keeping the fix-plan item moving is prerequisite for long-term goal #1 (run full parallel parity command) because -nonoise/-pix0 work is blocked on Phase K completion.
How-To Map:
- Set environment: `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; verify the binary exists before running parity tools.
- Execute Do Now command from repo root so pytest picks up the repo’s editable install; expect the test to emit per-φ stats into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/`.
- After pytest, append the new metrics (corr, RMSE, Δh/Δk/Δl, sum ratio) to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md`; update Attempt narration if tolerances finally hold.

- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` with a short paragraph noting the regenerated trace results and referencing the new diff path.
- Summarise the rerun in `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #47 notes (append sub-bullet) so the ledger reflects the passing parity.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Forgetting `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` will crash Python before tests run; set it for every parity command.
- Do not touch production code unless parity evidence exposes a concrete failure; this loop is about evidence gathering.
- Keep vectorised paths intact—no reintroducing Python loops or `.item()` extractions in debugging snippets.
- Maintain device/dtype neutrality; when you capture tensors, use `.to(dtype=existing.dtype, device=existing.device)` patterns rather than hard-coded CPU conversions.
- Store every artifact under `reports/…/` with informative filenames; avoid scattering data in /tmp.
- Leave `input.md` read-only from Ralph’s perspective.
- Honor the Protected Assets rule—do not rename or remove anything referenced in docs/index.md (loop.sh, supervisor.sh, input.md, etc.).
- Run only the mapped pytest selector; the full suite waits until code changes land.
- When using nb-compare, ensure `$NB_C_BIN` points to the instrumented binary to keep logs consistent.
- After generating large artifacts, add git-lfs ignore if needed instead of checking binaries in git.

Summary: Confirm the MOSFLM rescale fix by rerunning the scaling parity workflow and refreshing every dependent artifact so Phase K3g can close cleanly.
- Phase: Validation
- Mode: Parity
- Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003
- Branch: feature/spec-based-2
- Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c
- Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 — run "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`
If Blocked: Capture a fresh Phase K3f trace (`trace_py.log`) and log the failure context under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/attempts.md` so we can diagnose before touching code.
Priorities & Rationale:
1. plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase K3g lists the scaling parity rerun as the only remaining gate after K3g1/K3g2 went green.
2. docs/fix_plan.md (Attempt #47) records MOSFLM validation and explicitly calls for K3g3 before Phase L.
3. specs/spec-a-cli.md §Interpolation/Normalization still defines Δh/Δk/Δl tolerances and intensity sum ratios; we must show compliance.
4. reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md now documents the placeholder-volume root cause as resolved, but it also asks for regenerated traces and scaling metrics.
5. Long-term goal #1 (full parallel parity command) is blocked until CLI-FLAGS-003 closes; this loop removes the last evidence gap.
How-To Map:
1. Environment prep:
   - `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
   - `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
   - `export NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1` when running pytest.
2. Pytest execution:
   - Navigate to repo root.
   - Run `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v` with env above.
   - Capture stdout/stderr to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest_post_fix.log`.
3. Metrics update:
   - Open `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md`.
   - Append a new section dated today with correlation, RMSE, Δh, Δk, Δl, sum ratio, peak match counts.
   - Note whether tolerances (Δ ≤ 5e-4, correlation ≥ 0.999, sum ratio in 0.99–1.01) are met.
4. nb-compare rerun:
   - Command (single line):
     `nb-compare --c-bin $NB_C_BIN -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0`
   - Store outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/nb_compare_post_fix/`.
   - Record metrics (correlation, RMSE, peak distances) in a short README inside that directory.
5. Trace refresh:
   - Run `PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/trace_py.log` (env still has KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK).
   - Use `python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/compare_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/c_stdout.txt --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/trace_diff.txt`.
   - Confirm Δh, Δk, Δl in the diff shrink below 5e-4; summarize in `summary.md` under a new dated bullet.
6. Documentation sync:
   - Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` with a bullet citing the regenerated trace results.
   - Add a note to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md` referencing the nb-compare directory.
   - Append a short paragraph to `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #47 (sub-bullet) capturing the parity metrics.
7. Optional closure prep:
   - If everything passes, draft a note in plan Phase L (not executing yet) summarizing readiness for the supervisor command rerun.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
1. Skipping `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` will trigger libomp errors before tests run.
2. Do not modify production code this loop; we are collecting evidence.
3. Keep vectorization intact—no introducing Python loops into scaling paths while debugging.
4. Maintain device/dtype neutrality when logging tensors; avoid `tensor.cpu()` unless copying for numpy output.
5. Place all generated files under the documented `reports/` hierarchy; no stray /tmp artifacts.
6. Leave `input.md` untouched after reading it.
7. Respect Protected Assets listed in docs/index.md (loop.sh, supervisor.sh, input.md, etc.).
8. Run only the mapped pytest selector; skip full-suite runs until implementation work resumes.
9. Annotate any nb-compare deviations immediately; do not rely on memory.
10. When editing markdown summaries, keep ASCII formatting and follow existing section conventions.

Summary: Confirm the MOSFLM rescale fix by rerunning the scaling parity workflow and refreshing every dependent artifact so Phase K3g can close cleanly.
- Phase: Validation
- Mode: Parity
- Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003
- Branch: feature/spec-based-2
- Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c
- Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/, reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 — run "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`
If Blocked: Capture a fresh Phase K3f trace (`trace_py.log`) and log the failure context under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/attempts.md` so we can diagnose before touching code.
Priorities & Rationale:
1. plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase K3g lists the scaling parity rerun as the only remaining gate after K3g1/K3g2 went green.
2. docs/fix_plan.md (Attempt #47) records MOSFLM validation and explicitly calls for K3g3 before Phase L.
3. specs/spec-a-cli.md §Interpolation/Normalization still defines Δh/Δk/Δl tolerances and intensity sum ratios; we must show compliance.
4. reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md now documents the placeholder-volume root cause as resolved, but it also asks for regenerated traces and scaling metrics.
5. Long-term goal #1 (full parallel parity command) is blocked until CLI-FLAGS-003 closes; this loop removes the last evidence gap.
How-To Map:
1. Environment prep:
   - `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
   - `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`
   - `export NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1` when running pytest.
2. Pytest execution:
   - Navigate to repo root.
   - Run `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v` with env above.
   - Capture stdout/stderr to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest_post_fix.log`.
3. Metrics update:
   - Open `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md`.
   - Append a new section dated today with correlation, RMSE, Δh, Δk, Δl, sum ratio, peak match counts.
   - Note whether tolerances (Δ ≤ 5e-4, correlation ≥ 0.999, sum ratio in 0.99–1.01) are met.
4. nb-compare rerun:
   - Command (single line):
     `nb-compare --c-bin $NB_C_BIN -- -mat A.mat -floatfile img.bin -hkl scaled.hkl -nonoise -nointerpolate -oversample 1 -exposure 1 -flux 1e18 -beamsize 1.0 -spindle_axis -1 0 0 -Xbeam 217.742295 -Ybeam 213.907080 -distance 231.274660 -lambda 0.976800 -pixel 0.172 -detpixels_x 2463 -detpixels_y 2527 -odet_vector -0.000088 0.004914 -0.999988 -sdet_vector -0.005998 -0.999970 -0.004913 -fdet_vector 0.999982 -0.005998 -0.000118 -pix0_vector_mm -216.336293 215.205512 -230.200866 -beam_vector 0.00051387949 0.0 -0.99999986 -Na 36 -Nb 47 -Nc 29 -osc 0.1 -phi 0 -phisteps 10 -detector_rotx 0 -detector_roty 0 -detector_rotz 0 -twotheta 0`
   - Store outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/nb_compare_post_fix/`.
   - Record metrics (correlation, RMSE, peak distances) in a short README inside that directory.
5. Trace refresh:
   - Run `PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/trace_py.log` (env still has KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK).
   - Use `python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/compare_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/c_stdout.txt --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/trace_py.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/trace_diff.txt`.
   - Confirm Δh, Δk, Δl in the diff shrink below 5e-4; summarize in `summary.md` under a new dated bullet.
6. Documentation sync:
   - Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` with a bullet citing the regenerated trace results.
   - Add a note to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md` referencing the nb-compare directory.

**Expanding plan with detailed steps and verification**

I’m working on fleshing out the existing plan by adding multiple sub-steps per main step, breaking them into numbered lines to hit the target length. I’ll also create a new “Verification checklist” section with detailed verification points for outputs and tests, plus expand existing sections like "How-To Map" and "Pitfalls" with more thorough instructions and warnings. This should make the plan more comprehensive and easier to follow.
[2025-10-06T23:27:24] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' >> input.md
Verification Checklist:
1. Confirm pytest log shows "'`tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` PASSED with no skips and NB_RUN_PARALLEL banner printed.
2. Verify scaling_chain.md new section includes timestamp, command, correlation, RMSE, Δh, Δk, Δl, sum ratio, and explicit pass/fail statements.
3. Ensure nb-compare output directory contains `metrics.json`, `difference.png`, and a short README summarising thresholds.
4. Double-check `trace_diff.txt` reports Δh/Δk/Δl below 5e-4 before noting success.
5. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #47 with a sub-bullet referencing both the pytest log and nb-compare metrics.
6. Stage all modified artifacts (`reports/...`, plan updates) so the supervisor can review diffs without fishing for untracked files.
7. Note any anomalies (e.g., lingering Δk spikes) in galph_memory during handoff; silence implies success.

**Expanding content with additional sections**
[2025-10-06T23:27:39] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' >> input.md
Context Recap:
1. Attempt #46 captured the 40× reciprocal vector mismatch; those artifacts remain under "'`phase_k/base_lattice/` for reference.
2. Commit 46ba36b introduced the MOSFLM rescale branch and regression test; Attempt #47 documented the new evidence but deferred scaling rerun.
3. The plan now marks K3g1 and K3g2 complete, setting the stage for K3g3; this loop provides the necessary parity proof.
4. No production code changes are expected; success depends on evidence capture and documentation updates.
Data Management Notes:
1. Keep raw nb-compare outputs in the dedicated `nb_compare_post_fix/` folder; do not mix with previous attempts to preserve chronology.
2. When editing markdown summaries, maintain chronological order (oldest to newest) and include UTC timestamp if possible.
3. If any command fails, record the exact stderr in a `*_failure.log` file alongside the attempted command.
4. Use ASCII tables in summaries to keep reports diff-friendly; avoid embedding large binary blobs or images directly in git.
5. Ensure every new artifact path is relative to repo root so future automation can find it.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- - Next Actions (2025-11-08 refresh):
-  1. Phase K3f4 — Append a “Root Cause” section to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` capturing the MOSFLM volume/rescale gap and outline the fix path; propagate the note into plan ⟶ docs/fix_plan (done once summary updated).
-  2. Phase K3g1/K3g2 — Implement the MOSFLM real-vector rebuild in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (derive `V_cell`, real vectors, and updated reciprocal duals from the supplied A* matrix) and land the accompanying regression test under `tests/test_cli_scaling.py` (or sibling). Reference nanoBragg.c lines 3135-3210 in the code docstring per Core Rule #11.
-  3. Phase K3g3 (then K3c) — Re-run scaling evidence with `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, refresh `phase_k/f_latt_fix/` artifacts + nb-compare, and close Attempt #46 once Δh/Δk/Δl < 5e-4 and F_latt parity holds.
+- Next Actions (2025-11-08 update):
+  1. Phase K3g3 — Re-run scaling evidence with `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, refresh `phase_k/f_latt_fix/` artifacts + nb-compare, and confirm Δh/Δk/Δl < 5e-4 alongside F_latt parity.
+  2. Phase K3c/K3L prep — Once scaling is green, rerun the supervisor nb-compare command (Plan Phase L1) and targeted CLI regressions (L2) before closeout documentation (L3).
+  3. Documentation sync — Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/summary.md` diff with fresh traces post-K3g3 and reflect outcomes in galph_memory/plan archives.

   150	| H6e | Confirm pivot parity (SAMPLE vs BEAM) | [D] | ✅ Attempt #39 (2025-10-06) documented pivot mismatch in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md`. C evidence: `grep "pivoting"` shows "pivoting detector around sample". PyTorch evidence: inline config snippet shows DetectorPivot.BEAM. Root cause confirmed: `DetectorConfig` missing custom-vector-to-SAMPLE-pivot forcing rule. Spec citations and impact analysis complete. Updated `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with cross-reference. |
   151	| H6f | Align pivot selection when custom vectors provided | [D] | ✅ Attempt #40 (2025-10-26) updated `DetectorConfig.__post_init__` to force SAMPLE pivot whenever custom detector basis vectors (fdet/sdet/odet/beam) are supplied, added regression suite `TestCLIPivotSelection` (CPU+CUDA, float32/float64), relocated visuals under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and logged implementation notes at `pivot_fix.md`. |
   152	| H6g | Re-run pix0 traces after pivot fix | [D] | ✅ Attempt #41 (2025-10-27) reran the harness with SAMPLE pivot enforced; `phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log`, `trace_diff.txt`, and `metadata.json` show |Δpix0| ≤ 2.85 µm and zero beam-center deltas. nb-compare smoke stored alongside traces; docs/fix_plan Attempt #41 updated. |
   153	| H5d | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31. docs/fix_plan.md logs the revert metrics and artifacts (Attempt #31), so Phase K normalization work can proceed with the restored baseline. |
   154	| H5e | Correct beam-center→F/S mapping units | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-24 Attempt #33. `Detector._configure_geometry` now converts `self.config.beam_center_f/s` (mm) to meters via `/1000.0` before computing Fbeam/Sbeam, resolving the 1.1mm ΔF error. All 26 CLI flags tests passing. Artifacts: `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:490-515`, `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #33. Original task: Investigate the 2025-10-22 trace deltas showing ΔF≈-1.1 mm. Confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` is stored in millimetres (see `__main__.py:915-937`) and update `Detector._configure_geometry` so BEAM-pivot F/S values convert mm→m before constructing pix0 (match `nanoBragg.c:1184-1239`). Add targeted trace demonstrating the fix under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` and record Attempt #33 in fix_plan with metrics. |

   156	### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
   157	Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
   158	Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
   159	Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

   164	| I2 | Implement polarization parity | [P] | ✅ 2025-10-17 update set BeamConfig.polarization_factor default to 1.0, but C traces (2025-10-31) confirm the Kahn factor defaults to 0.0 when `-polar` is absent. Reopen to: (a) restore 0.0 default, (b) keep -polar/-nopolar overrides working, and (c) adjust TestCLIPolarization expectations accordingly. |
   165	| I3 | Final parity sweep | [P] | Attempt #27 (2025-10-06) failed with 124,538× intensity scaling gap; remains blocked pending Phase K fixes (orientation rescale + polarization default). |

   167	### Phase J — Intensity Scaling Evidence
   168	Goal: Isolate the first divergence in the normalization chain (steps, ω, r_e², fluence) responsible for the 1.2×10⁵ intensity mismatch.
   169	Prereqs: Phase I2 complete; beam/pix0/orientation traces from Phases F–H archived.

**Formatting detailed final message**
[2025-10-06T23:29:52] codex

**Outcome**
- Logged MOSFLM rescale validation artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/cell_tensors_py.txt:1`) showing PyTorch now reproduces C cell vectors/volumes after commit 46ba36b.
- Advanced the active plan: Phase K3f4 and K3g1/K3g2 marked done, with K3g3 still open (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:18`, `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:203`–214).
- Refreshed fix-plan guidance so the next action is the scaling parity rerun (`docs/fix_plan.md:448`–461).
- Issued a detailed 100-line supervisor memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to run the targeted pytest, nb-compare, and trace refresh loop.

**Deep Analysis**
- With the placeholder-volume bug resolved, the remaining blocker for long-term goal #1 is re-running the F_latt parity workflow; all plan/fix-plan pointers now converge on K3g3 (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:214`, `docs/fix_plan.md:458`–461).
- Hypothesis 1 (High confidence): The scaling test will now pass once rerun because real/reciprocal vectors match C within 5e-6 (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/cell_tensors_py.txt:1`). Next confirming step: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`.
- Hypothesis 2 (Medium confidence): If parity still fails, the culprit will be downstream normalization factors (steps, ω, or polarization). Next step: rerun `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/scaling_chain.md` comparisons to isolate the first mismatched term.
- No indications of new regressions in CLI flag handling beyond the pending scaling evidence.

**Ralph Review**
- Recent work (46ba36b) was productive: MOSFLM rescale landed with an explicit regression test and meets spec (`tests/test_cli_scaling.py::TestMOSFLMCellVectors::test_mosflm_cell_vectors` cited in plan row `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:212`).
- Gap: the supporting artifacts and fix-plan entries weren’t fully updated after the commit; this loop bridged that documentation gap so Ralph can stay focused on execution rather than bookkeeping.
- No regressions spotted in the last ~10 iterations; progress now depends on collecting the final parity evidence.

**Next Steps**
- Execute the K3g3 checklist: targeted pytest, nb-compare rerun, trace regeneration, and scaling_chain.md update (see `input.md` Do Now line and How-To map).
- Once metrics are green, prepare for Phase L (supervisor command nb-compare) as the final gate to close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- No tests were run in this supervisor loop.
