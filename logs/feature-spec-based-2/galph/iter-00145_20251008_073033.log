this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

# Galph Memory

> Entries prior to 2025-11 have been moved to `archive/galph_memory/2025-09_to_2025-10.md` (summarized on 2025-12-04).

### Archived Summary (2025-09 → 2025-10)
- Established supervisor workflow, enforced prompts/debug.md routing, and opened initial parity/performance plans (AT-021 trace parity, AT-012 rotation, PERF-PYTORCH-004, REPO-HYGIENE-002).
- Diagnosed key issues: φ=0 carryover, metric duality regression (V_actual vs formula volume), pix0 override drift, torch.compile warm-up overhead, and float32 plateau fragmentation hurting peak matching.
- Captured repeated reminders on Protected Assets/dirty worktree hygiene and documented long-term goals (CLI parity restoration before vectorization, Dynamo cache validation, detector pivot rules).
- Logged recommended follow-ups: restore Core Rule #13 duality, regenerate parity traces, tighten test tolerances after fixes, and prioritize evidence artifacts under `reports/` for Ralph’s loops.

## 2025-11-06 (galph loop — K3d dtype evidence prep)
- Coin flip=heads → reviewed Ralph commits d150858, b73f0e2; work productive (Phase H1 evidence, Phase G3 orientation fix).
- Updated plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase H goal + tasks (H1 marked done; new H2 beam propagation, H3 lattice, H4 parity).
- docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions now call out H2–H4 sequence; reinforced beam-vector fix as first deliverable.
- Authored new input.md (Do Now: Phase H2 beam propagation + targeted pytest) and committed with message "SUPERVISOR: CLI H2 plan refresh - tests: not run".
- Working tree clean post-push (feature/spec-based-2 @ 35cd319).
 - Follow-up: Ralph to wire detector.beam_vector into Simulator, rerun beam trace, and land targeted pytest per input.md.
## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3 evidence prep)
- git sync clean (ba649f0). Reviewed required specs/arch/testing docs plus plans/active entries before analysis per SOP.

- Key finding: PyTorch SQUARE lattice factor still feeds sincg with `(h-h0)` (src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py) vs C’s `sincg(M_PI*h, Na)` (`golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3063-3080`); Phase K1 must correct this.
- Follow-up expectations: Ralph generates H5c PyTorch traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/`, updates parity_summary metrics, and drafts Attempt #32.

## 2025-10-24 (galph loop — Phase H5 unit fix directive)
- Reconfirmed pix0 fast-axis delta (≈1.1 mm) persists post-H5b revert; traced root cause to Detector BEAM pivot still treating beam_center_f/s as pixel counts (mm×m bug).
- Added Phase H5e row to `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` directing mm→m conversion with new trace artifacts; refreshed docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions to prioritise H5a/H5c/H5e sequence before Phase K.
- Issued `input.md` (Implementation phase) instructing Ralph to implement unit fix, capture trace evidence under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/`, run `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override`, and log Attempt #33.
- No code changes made this loop; planning/docs only. Next follow-up: verify H5e Attempt captures <5e-5 m pix0 deltas, then greenlight Phase K1 (sincg update).

## 2025-10-24 (galph loop — Phase K1 directive)
- Re-ran parity backlog review after clean `git pull`; active focus remains CLI-FLAGS-003. H5c traces still missing post-unit-fix, so emphasized capturing them as part of upcoming Phase K work.
- Deep dive confirmed SQUARE lattice factor still uses `(h-h0)` in `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:200-280`, violating `specs/spec-a-core.md:218` and C reference `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3069-3079`. Phase J evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`) still shows 3.6e-7 intensity ratio.
- Ralph’s recent loop (315a54c) successfully closed H5e; no regressions spotted in commit diffs. Pending action is Phase K1 sincg parity plus Phase K2 scaling refresh.
- Issued new `input.md` (Implementation phase, 107 lines) detailing Phase K1 tasks: swap to `sincg(torch.pi * h, Na)`, rerun scaling traces, author `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`, and update plan/attempt logs with artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/`.
- Follow-up for next supervisor loop: verify Ralph delivers Phase K1 artifacts (trace_py_after.log, scaling_chain_after.md, pytest log) and updates docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #34 before greenlighting Phase K2.

## 2025-10-24 (galph loop — H5c trace refresh directive)
- Re-ran `git pull --rebase` (clean) then reviewed plans/fix_plan/context.
- Noted K1 lattice fix landed in commit 0fef8f7 but plan still marked [ ]; updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:125-133` to mark K1 done, tighten H5c guidance (new 2025-10-24 trace path), and clarify K2/K3 follow-ups.

- Hypotheses logged: (1) K3g3 pytest/nb-compare likely pass now that MOSFLM rescale is fixed (confidence medium); (2) If mismatch persists, trace regeneration will expose lingering normalization gaps; (3) Remaining variance could stem from pix0/beam vector interplay, so trace-first debugging stays mandatory.
- Updated `plans/active/vectorization.md` with a 2025-11-09 gap snapshot and refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 next actions to highlight Phase A A1–A3 as blocking.
- Authored new supervisor `input.md` directing Ralph to execute K3g3 (targeted pytest + nb-compare + trace refresh) with stamped artifacts and to update scaling_chain/summary plus fix_plan Attempt log.
- Follow-up for Ralph: run the specified pytest node under parity env, regenerate nb-compare + base-lattice traces, refresh reports/summary, and record Attempt update; if blocked, capture trace logs under `base_lattice/blocked/` and document stall.

## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — Phase L1 HKL parity prep)
- `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` clean; coin toss = tails so no retrospective audit.
- CLI-FLAGS-003 still blocked by supervisor command parity (corr≈0.9965, sum_ratio≈1.26e5). Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L with explicit L1–L4 tasks (HKL parity → scaling trace → diagnosis → rerun) and synced docs/fix_plan Next Actions to those steps.
- Authored new `input.md` (Mode=Parity) directing Ralph to execute Phase L1 by building `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py`, regenerating a stamped `Fdump_scaled` cache, and logging HKL parity metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`.
- Hypotheses for 1.26e5× intensity gap: (H1) HKL ingestion mismatch (PyTorch grid defaults vs C’s Fdump) — high confidence; next confirming step is L1 comparison script. (H2) Residual scaling-chain divergence post-MOSFLM fix (fluence/polar chain) — medium confidence; confirmation via Phase L2 traces after HKL parity passes.
- Vectorization goal remains untouched; plan `plans/active/vectorization.md` still at Phase A baseline because `_tricubic_interpolation` falls back to nearest-neighbor for batched tensors (see src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:272+). Keep on radar once CLI parity clears.

## 2025-11-09 (galph loop — L1b prep)
- Reproduced Phase L1 parity run with a fresh cache (`Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin`); mismatch persists (max |ΔF| 5.22e2, 99,209 voxels). File encodes 182,700 doubles (≈9.5k extra) and shifts reflections (Δk≈+10–12, Δl≈−2…−8), pointing to a layout/ordering discrepancy rather than corruption.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L table (L1a–L1d) to capture completed evidence and new layout-analysis + IO alignment tasks. Logged the addendum referencing the new cache.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` with Phase L1b–L1d focus and recorded Attempt #51 (evidence update). Added layout-analysis to next actions block.
- Authored `input.md` directing Ralph to implement Phase L1b via a new `scripts/validation/analyze_fdump_layout.py` helper and to stash findings in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/` before moving to L1c.

- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to require C instrumentation before any per-φ diff, explicitly mandating BLOCKED status when C entries are absent.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions with the new instrumentation guard so L3k.3b focuses on emitting TRACE_C_PHI and regenerating traces under a fresh timestamp.
- Replaced `input.md` (Parity) directing Ralph to add TRACE_C_PHI prints in `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c`, rebuild, rerun the supervisor command, regenerate PyTorch traces, fix the misleading comparison summary, and capture updated diagnosis + checklist notes.
- Follow-up: Expect Ralph to land the instrumentation, produce `c_trace_phi_<timestamp>.log`, update comparison_summary to BLOCKED (until data present), refresh VG-1.4, and only then proceed toward VG-3/VG-4.
## 2025-10-07 (galph loop — L3k.3c prep)
- Synced repo (no conflicts) and reviewed docs/specs per SOP; coin flip→heads so Ralph’s last commit ee83081 confirmed TRACE_C_PHI instrumentation success (φ_tic=0 delta only).
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to mark L3k.3b DONE and clarified L3k.3c guidance (refresh comparison summary, hold φ_tic=0 focus). Input.md now steers Ralph to land the φ=0 rotation fix, regenerate per-φ traces, and flip VG-1.4 once Δk ≤1e-6.
- No code changes made; staged plan/input updates committed (`ddf68e4`).
- Follow-up for Ralph: implement L3k.3c φ=0 parity fix, capture new per-φ traces/tests per input.md, then proceed to L3k.3d nb-compare work once VG-1 is green.
## 2025-10-07 18:24 UTC (galph loop)
- Re-synced plan for CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3k.3c after reviewing Attempt #102.
- Updated plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md to require restoring C-aligned φ=0 tests before further work; added L3k.3c.1–.3 checklist.
- Marked Attempt #102 in docs/fix_plan.md as INVALID (masked failure) and listed required follow-up steps.
- Authored parity-mode input.md directing Ralph to reinstate the failing φ=0 test and log artifacts under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/.
- Expect Ralph to restore the C-referenced pytest assertions, capture the resulting failure log, and update diagnosis.md plus fix_plan Attempts before implementing the actual φ=0 fix.

## 2025-11-22 (galph loop — φ=0 carryover evidence prep)
- Confirmed PyTorch `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors` returns `rot_b_phi0_y=0.71732 Å` while C trace holds `0.671588 Å` because nanoBragg.c:3040 skips resetting `ap/bp/cp` when `phi==0`. Python snippet recorded under this loop’s notes (see console command history).
- Noted commit 6f822dd introduced a Python loop over `phi_steps` (src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1057-1084); plan instructs Ralph to document vectorized remediation so we can restore batched flow post-fix.

# nanoBragg Spec A — Core Engine

This shard contains the normative physics, geometry, sampling, and data handling requirements. CLI flag semantics live in [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md); cross-implementation profiles and developer tooling are captured in [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md).

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### C-IMPL-BUG-002 — Incorrect Angle Units in `mosaic_rotation_umat` (High)
**Summary:** The random misset path feeds `90.0` (degrees) into `mosaic_rotation_umat`, but the helper interprets angles in radians. The code therefore constructs rotation matrices using a 90-radian cap (≈5156°), which produces non-physical orientations.

**Reproduction:**
```bash
./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg \
  -cell 50 60 70 80 90 100 \
  -misset random \

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 — unlock the supervisor parity command by aligning PyTorch CLI behavior with nanoBragg.c for `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm`.
- Current Objective: Finish the remaining φ=0 parity, scaling, and normalization work so the authoritative command below produces ≥0.9995 correlation, sum ratio 0.99–1.01, and ≤1 px mean peak distance.
  - Authoritative command (C + PyTorch parity harness):

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): ✅ **Instrumentation aligned (2025-10-07).** Pre-polarization `I_before_scaling` now matches C within ~0.2% (941698.5 vs 943654.8), confirming the prior −8.7% delta was a trace measurement artifact. PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.
- Next Actions (2025-12-05 refresh):
1. **Stabilise scaling comparison tooling** — Reproduce and fix the `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` SIGKILL observed in Attempts #137/#141 so Phase M evidence can be generated via the canonical script instead of inline Python. Capture the patched command + sha catalog in a fresh `reports/.../scaling_validation/<timestamp>/` directory.
2. **Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up** — Augment the trace harness (if needed) to log 4×4×4 neighbourhood weights / `sincg` inputs alongside the existing traces, then update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1 guidance with the 20251008T070513Z audit path and the new metrics. Document results in `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt log.
3. **Phase M2 lattice investigation** — Use the refreshed instrumentation to isolate the φ₀ `F_latt` drift (≈0.13%). Compare against `nanoBragg.c` accumulation loops, implement the fix, and add a targeted pytest (`tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestScalingParity::test_I_before_scaling_matches_c`).
4. **Phase N/O readiness** — Once scaling deltas ≤1e-6, regenerate nb-compare ROI artifacts and schedule the supervisor command closure run with SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
5. **Parity shim documentation follow-up** — Complete `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` Phase C5 checklist (summary.md + spec citation + fix_plan Attempt) and Phase D3 handoff before the final parity rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Test collection: 35 tests collected successfully in 2.16s (test_cli_scaling_phi0.py + test_phi_carryover_mode.py). Documentation-only loop per input.md Mode: Docs.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)

  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-12-02): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Phase E1 regression sweep finished (artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`); Phase E2–E3 remain open ahead of detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

- Phase Goal: Produce a clear, timestamped baseline of pyrefly diagnostics, map them to fix-plan priorities, and hand Ralph a scoped backlog with authoritative commands and artifact locations.
- Dependencies: 
  - `prompts/pyrefly.md` — SOP for running the static-analysis loop.
  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §1.5 — testing cadence and command sourcing rules.
  - `docs/fix_plan.md` — active item ledger for logging attempts and delegations.
  - `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pyrefly]` — configuration guardrail (must remain untouched).
  - Environment availability of the `pyrefly` CLI (verify via `command -v pyrefly`).
- Artifact Policy: Store every run under `reports/pyrefly/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` with `commands.txt`, raw logs, `summary.md`, and `env.json`. Never commit these directories; reference them from fix_plan attempts.

### Phase A — Preconditions & Tool Audit
Goal: Confirm pyrefly is configured and document the command surface before any analysis run.
Prereqs: Clean git status (aside from known WIP), docs/index.md reread, fix_plan entry marked active.
Exit Criteria: Verified tool availability recorded, command plan captured, and reports directory prepared.

- First Divergence (if known): PyTorch intensity identical whether `oversample_thick` is enabled; C nanoBragg increases capture fraction on oblique pixels by ≥3%, confirming PyTorch path skips per-subpixel geometry.
- Next Actions:

  2. Complete Phase B design notes describing tensor flow for `subpixel_coords_all` into `_apply_detector_absorption` and expected performance impact.
  3. Implement per-subpixel absorption (Phase C) with regression tests and run parity/perf validation plus documentation updates (Phase D).
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-17] Attempt #0 — Result: backlog entry. Logged bug description (pixel centers forwarded to absorption) and created plan `plans/active/oversample-thick-subpixel.md`; no code changes yet.
- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure GPU/CPU parity; avoid introducing Python loops; maintain differentiability by keeping tensor operations (no `.item()`/`.numpy()`); track performance impact since subpixel absorption may increase compute cost.

**Reviewing fix_plan and long-term goals**

I'm comparing the latest fix_plan entries with memory dates to check for missing updates and possible truncation. I plan to run `git status` to confirm any uncommitted changes. I'm also thinking about how these fix_plan details relate to the long-term goals—especially the CLI parity and vectorization phases—and considering if a new plan is needed. I need to look into the `cli-phi-parity-shim` plan and review docs and specs related to the phi 0 bug to verify if any fixes or updates are required.

/home/ollie/.bash_profile: line 5: /home/ollie/.cargo/env: No such file or directory
## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-12-01 refresh): Spec baseline locked, opt-in parity shim landed (Attempts #120/#121), and the dtype sensitivity probe in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/` confirmed the Δk≈2.845e-05 plateau is inherent to the C carryover bug. Decision logged to relax the VG-1 tolerance for c-parity mode to |Δk| ≤ 5e-5; documentation/test updates (Phase C5/D) remain outstanding.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

**Evaluating plan status and update needs**

I’m analyzing the current `cli-phi-parity-shim` plan to identify gaps, especially pending tasks like C5 and D3.

**Analyzing plan discrepancy and update needs**

I’m noticing a mismatch where Phase M1 is marked done, but the input still flags the script as broken, implying a regression. This means the plan is outdated and needs revision to reflect the reopened status and ongoing script fixes.

# CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 Validation Report

## Executive Summary

**Status:** ✅ Script Operational (Pre-existing Fix Verified)
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-08T07:25:13Z
**Git SHA:** df6df98c23375813e46e18b9ad562eb2707a447b

The `compare_scaling_traces.py` script is **fully operational** and successfully processes both C and PyTorch scaling traces. Previous SIGKILL crashes appear to have been resolved in an earlier iteration.

## Test Results

### Script Execution
- ✅ Script runs without errors
- ✅ Generates all required outputs:
  - `scaling_validation_summary.md`
  - `metrics.json`
  - `run_metadata.json`

**Updating plans to reflect script regression reopening**

I'm noting that the script regression requires reopening Phase M1 and updating both the main plan and fix_plan to reflect the current failing status. I’m focusing on carefully adding detailed checklists and status notes referencing recent evidence while aligning next actions and ensuring documentation is explicitly listed consistent with the planning guidelines.

/home/ollie/.bash_profile: line 5: /home/ollie/.cargo/env: No such file or directory
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **CRITICAL FINDING**: F_cell values match perfectly (C: 190.27, PyTorch: 190.270004272461), eliminating the hypothesis that data loading was responsible for the divergence
      - **Root cause narrowed**: I_before_scaling diverges by 21.9% (C: 943654.809, PyTorch: 736750.125), but all scaling factors (r_e², fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polarization, omega_pixel, cos_2theta) match C within 1e-7 relative tolerance
      - **Lattice factors**: F_latt components match structure (F_latt_a: -2.396, F_latt_b: -0.858, F_latt_c: 0.671) → F_latt: 1.379
      - **HKL alignment**: Miller indices match exactly (hkl_rounded: -7, -1, -14)
      - **First divergence**: I_before_scaling is the FIRST and PRIMARY divergence; final intensity diverges as a consequence
      - **Remaining hypothesis**: The accumulation logic (sum over phi steps, mosaic domains, sources, oversample) must have a missing term or incorrect iteration structure
    Next Actions:
      - Phase M2: Trace I_before_scaling accumulation across all φ steps (10 steps visible in per-φ log) to identify which component of the sum (F_cell² × F_latt² product) is missing or scaled incorrectly
      - Phase M2a: Compare per-φ trace structure against C-code loop nesting in nanoBragg.c:2500–2700 (pixel intensity accumulation)
      - Phase M3: Once the accumulation bug is isolated, implement fix and regenerate evidence to verify ≤1e-6 relative error on I_before_scaling
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #138 (ralph loop i=138, Mode: Parity) — Result: **EVIDENCE** (Phase M1 scaling trace refreshed with current git state). **No code changes.**
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #140 (galph loop — Phase M1 parity metrics refresh, Mode: Parity/Evidence) — Result: **EVIDENCE UPDATE** (spec vs c-parity scaling audit rerun with float64 harness). **No code changes.**
    Metrics:
      - `--phi-mode spec` (expected divergence): `I_before_scaling` PyTorch 805473.787 vs C 943654.809 ⇒ −14.643% (Δ −1.38e5); `I_pixel_final` PyTorch 2.459466e-07 vs C 2.881395e-07 ⇒ −14.643%. Demonstrates spec-compliant path disagrees with C bug as intended.
      - `--phi-mode c-parity`: `I_before_scaling` PyTorch 941686.236 vs C 943654.809 ⇒ −0.2086%; `I_pixel_final` PyTorch 2.875383e-07 vs C 2.881395e-07 ⇒ −0.2087%. First divergence remains the raw pre-polar intensity.
    Artifacts:
      - Spec run: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T055257Z/trace_py_scaling.log` (44 TRACE_PY lines), `.../manual_scaling_summary.md`, `.../manual_metrics.json`, `.../trace_py_scaling_per_phi.log/json` (nested under `per_phi/.../20251008T055257Z/`).
      - C-parity run: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T055533Z/trace_py_scaling.log`, `.../manual_scaling_summary.md`, `.../manual_metrics.json`, companion per-φ logs at `per_phi/.../20251008T055533Z/`.

**Updating plan to reflect script regression**

I’m updating the plan to note that the M1 script is currently broken with recent crashes, adjusting the status snapshot, changing M1 task state to pending, and adding a detailed sub-checklist for fixing the script based on recent failure logs. I’ll also ensure the fix_plan document and attempt history reflect these changes without misrepresenting existing data.

/home/ollie/.bash_profile: line 5: /home/ollie/.cargo/env: No such file or directory
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Scaling factors downstream of lattice interpolation (r_e², fluence, steps, capture_fraction, polar, omega_pixel) continue to match within 5×10⁻⁷, reinforcing that the remaining 0.21% intensity gap originates in the lattice factor/HKL alignment.
      - F_latt component deltas of 1–3×10⁻³ point toward `_tricubic_interpolation` neighbourhood weighting rather than scalar accumulation; reciprocal vector drift at the 1e-5 level persists across φ steps.
      - `compare_scaling_traces.py` still exits via SIGKILL on the new traces; resolution remains a prerequisite before Phase M2 automation can resume.
    Next Actions:
      1. Extend Phase M1 instrumentation to log the 4×4×4 neighbourhood weights (or single-pixel `sincg` inputs) alongside the C trace so we can isolate the exact term contributing the 0.1% F_latt error.
      2. Patch or replace `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` so summary generation no longer depends on manual Python snippets; keep the failing command in commands.txt as repro evidence.
      3. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 guidance with the 20251008T060721Z artifact paths and highlight the quantified F_latt deltas to steer Ralph toward `_tricubic_interpolation` vs HKL indexing review.
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #144 (ralph loop i=144, Mode: Parity) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase M0 COMPLETE — Instrumentation Hygiene). **Code changes: Crystal + Simulator trace guard.**
    Metrics: Targeted tests 35/35 passed in 2.67s (test_cli_scaling_phi0.py + test_phi_carryover_mode.py); core geometry tests 66/66 passed in 8.13s. Trace harness executed successfully (114 TRACE_PY lines captured, pixel 685,1039 final intensity 2.875e-07).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/instrumentation_audit.md` — Phase M0 completion audit

      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T070513Z/commands.txt` — Git state + env exports
    Code Changes:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:123-124` — Added `_enable_trace` flag (default False) and initialized `_last_tricubic_neighborhood` to None
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:439-454` — Guarded `_last_tricubic_neighborhood` population with `if self._enable_trace:` conditional; production mode clears stale payload
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:501-504` — Set `crystal._enable_trace = True` when `trace_pixel` is configured in debug_config

PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic).

**Aligning plan updates with instructions**

I'm sorting out how to set the Mode and Do Now fields in the new `input.md` for Ralph, balancing planning and parity tasks to guide the next engineer loop. I’m working through embedding exact commands for rerunning the failing harness and script to capture failure evidence, plus updating summary, tests, artifacts, and references to match the fix_plan details. I'll also approximate line numbers for doc pointers to keep everything neatly cross-referenced.

   442	- First Divergence (if known): `parse_and_validate_args` (src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:435) calls `read_hkl_file`/`try_load_hkl_or_fdump` without forwarding the parsed dtype, so HKL/Fdump data is always loaded as float32. When the CLI is run with `-dtype float64`, the simulator converts those float32 tensors to float64 later, permanently losing precision relative to the requested double-precision path and violating the DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 guarantee.
   443	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   444	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   445	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   446	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   447	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   448	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   449	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic).

This includes summaries, mappings, priorities with file line references, step-by-step how-to instructions, pitfalls, pointers, and next steps—all formatted carefully with placeholders like `<timestamp>` and variables like `ts`.

If Blocked: If the script exits 0 unexpectedly, keep all logs, note behaviour in `$RUN_DIR/blocked.md`, and halt so we can reassess before patching.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:461 — Next Actions demand completing the reopened Phase M1 tooling checklist before any physics fixes.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:17 — Status snapshot notes the SIGKILL regression blocking automation.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:71 — M1 row set to [P]; requires fresh repro plus canonical artifacts.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:82 — Checklist M1a–M1d outlines the exact deliverables for this loop.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/commands.txt:1 — Prior failing command is the template you must refresh.
- scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py:1 — Tool under test; fixes must preserve CLI and JSON schema.
How-To Map:
1. Export `ts` and `RUN_DIR` exactly as in Do Now; record `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status -sb` at the top of `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt`.
2. Copy the authoritative supervisor command arguments from the plan into `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt` for provenance.
3. Run `trace_harness.py` command from Do Now; tee stdout/err to `trace_harness.log` and append a separator plus exit code to `commands.txt`.
4. Immediately invoke `compare_scaling_traces.py` with the paths above; tee output, capture the shell exit code into `compare_scaling_traces.exitcode`, and append both command + exit status to `commands.txt`.
5. If the process is killed, run `dmesg | tail -n 20 >> "$RUN_DIR/compare_scaling_traces.stdout"` to capture the kernel message.
6. Collect environment metadata via `python - <<'"'PY'"'` snippet (python version, torch version, CUDA availability, git SHA, timestamp) and write to `$RUN_DIR/env.json`.
7. After commands finish, list the directory contents (`ls -1 $RUN_DIR >> $RUN_DIR/commands.txt`), then compute checksums with `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt`).
8. Run the collect-only pytest selectors in Mapped tests, teeing output into `$RUN_DIR/pytest_collect.log`; if the crash prevented trace files from being written, note that before moving on.
9. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1a row with the new timestamp and a short status note.
10. Append a docs/fix_plan.md Attempt entry describing the reproduced crash, exit code, and artifact paths (no implementation yet).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` until the repro is archived.
- Avoid overwriting the 20251008 directories; always use a new UTC timestamp.
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `PYTHONPATH=src` on every python command.
- Preserve Protected Assets (`input.md`, `docs/index.md`, `loop.sh`, `supervisor.sh`).
- Do not run the full pytest suite; stick to the selectors listed.
- Capture exit codes explicitly—missing exitcode file blocks plan closure.
- Leave manual summaries untouched; this loop is evidence-only.
- Ensure commands.txt remains chronological and includes env + git info.
- Don’t delete previous traces; auditors rely on historical artifacts.
- Hold off on CUDA runs until the crash is understood.

How-To Map:
1. Export `ts` and `RUN_DIR` exactly as in Do Now; record `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status -sb` at the top of `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt`.
2. Copy the authoritative supervisor command arguments from the plan into `$RUN_DIR/commands.txt` for provenance.
3. Run `trace_harness.py` command from Do Now; tee stdout/err to `trace_harness.log` and append a separator plus exit code to `commands.txt`.
4. Immediately invoke `compare_scaling_traces.py` with the paths above; tee output, capture the shell exit code into `compare_scaling_traces.exitcode`, and append both command + exit status to `commands.txt`.
5. If the process is killed, run `dmesg | tail -n 20 >> "$RUN_DIR/compare_scaling_traces.stdout"` to capture the kernel message.
6. Collect environment metadata via `python - <<'"'PY'"'` snippet (python version, torch version, CUDA availability, git SHA, timestamp) and write to `$RUN_DIR/env.json`.
7. After commands finish, list the directory contents (`ls -1 $RUN_DIR >> $RUN_DIR/commands.txt`), then compute checksums with `(cd "$RUN_DIR" && shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt`).
8. Run the collect-only pytest selectors in Mapped tests, teeing output into `$RUN_DIR/pytest_collect.log`; if the crash prevented trace files from being written, note that before moving on.
9. Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1a row with the new timestamp and a short status note.
10. Append a docs/fix_plan.md Attempt entry describing the reproduced crash, exit code, and artifact paths (no implementation yet).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` until the repro is archived.
- Avoid overwriting the 20251008 directories; always use a new UTC timestamp.
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and `PYTHONPATH=src` on every python command.
- Preserve Protected Assets (`input.md`, `docs/index.md`, `loop.sh`, `supervisor.sh`).
- Do not run the full pytest suite; stick to the selectors listed.
- Capture exit codes explicitly—missing exitcode file blocks plan closure.
- Leave manual summaries untouched; this loop is evidence-only.
- Ensure commands.txt remains chronological and includes env + git info.
- Don’t delete previous traces; auditors rely on historical artifacts.
- Hold off on CUDA runs until the crash is understood.

 ### Phase N — ROI nb-compare Parity (VG‑3 & VG‑4)
 Goal: Once scaling is fixed, prove end-to-end image parity on the supervisor ROI using nb-compare and refreshed C/PyTorch outputs.
 Prereqs: Phase M complete (scaling metrics green). Ensure documentation sync from Phase L2 finished.

## 2025-10-08 (galph loop — STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B setup)
- Coin flip→heads: reviewed Ralph’s recent commits (`ef1f716`, `e97a66c`) and found them productive; Phase M1 instrumentation landed cleanly and pyrefly Phase A evidence captured without regressions.
- Chosen focus: STATIC-PYREFLY-001 Phase B baseline run; no new plan required since `plans/active/static-pyrefly.md` already governs the workflow.
- Actions this loop: refreshed `input.md` with Docs-mode guidance covering Phase B1–B3 deliverables (pyrefly.log, env.json, summary.md, fix_plan Attempt update) and reiterated artifact/timestamp reuse under `reports/pyrefly/20251008T053652Z/`.
- No changes to docs/fix_plan.md this turn; expect Ralph to record Attempt #2 after the baseline run and keep the working tree clean.
- Follow-up: next supervisor loop should inspect the new summary, decide on Phase C triage scope, and ensure pyrefly findings are mapped to owners/tests before delegating fixes.

## 2025-12-04 (galph loop — CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 refresh)
- Re-ran `trace_harness.py` in both spec and c-parity modes (float64/CPU) and stored evidence under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T055257Z/` (spec) and `.../20251008T055533Z/` (c-parity). Spec path diverges 14.6% as expected; c-parity delta shrank to 0.2086%.
- Added Attempt #140 to `docs/fix_plan.md:510` capturing the new metrics plus the crash encountered when invoking `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` on these traces.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:53` with the fresh timestamps and noted that Phase M1 remains open pending ≤1e-6 parity.
- `compare_scaling_traces.py` currently exits via SIGKILL on the new traces; manual summaries were generated as a stopgap. Ralph needs to debug the script before Phase M2 lattice fixes proceed.
- Next steps for Ralph: fix the comparison script, regenerate the scaling summary in a new timestamped directory (CPU float64, c-parity), then continue Phase M2 by targeting the φ₀ lattice-factor drift.
- Working tree note: legacy galph log (`logs/feature-spec-based-2/galph/iter-00141_20251008_054647.log`) stayed untouched per policy; left uncommitted.

## 2025-10-08 (galph loop — Phase M1 lattice delta audit)
- Captured fresh c-parity trace via `trace_harness.py` (float64/CPU) and stored manual summary + metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T060721Z/`; F_latt drift is ~0.13% and drives the 0.2086% `I_before_scaling` deficit.
- `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` still dies via SIGKILL; left the failing command in commands.txt and regenerated the summary with inline Python.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` (Attempt #141) and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M1 guidance to reference the new evidence and emphasise tricubic neighbourhood instrumentation.

 ### Phase N — ROI nb-compare Parity (VG‑3 & VG‑4)
 Goal: Once scaling is fixed, prove end-to-end image parity on the supervisor ROI using nb-compare and refreshed C/PyTorch outputs.
 Prereqs: Phase M complete (scaling metrics green). Ensure documentation sync from Phase L2 finished.

**Composing final message content**
[2025-10-08T07:37:40] codex

**Plan Update**
- Reopened CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1 and refreshed the status snapshot to document the renewed compare_scaling_traces.py SIGKILL plus the manual-summary stopgap (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:17`).
- Reset task M1 to [P] and added the tooling checklist M1a–M1d so Ralph has explicit deliverables for reproducing and fixing the crash (`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:71`, `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:82`).

**Fix Plan Ledger**
- Updated Next Actions to the 2025-12-06 revision that points directly at the new checklist and logged Attempt #146 capturing today’s planning change (`docs/fix_plan.md:461`, `docs/fix_plan.md:468`).

**Coordination Artifacts**
- Logged the supervisor note in galph_memory for future loops and issued a new input memo steering Ralph to execute M1a by archiving a fresh crash repro under a new timestamp (`galph_memory.md`, `input.md`).

Tests: not run (planning/documentation only).

Next Up: Ralph should run M1a to capture the failing compare_scaling_traces.py invocation, then report back before touching the script.

PyTorch emits both `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` (canonical C comparison point) and `I_before_scaling_post_polar` (diagnostic). The ~0.2% residual is expected per galph debug memo (float32 + F_latt drift). See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251007T222548Z/phase_m1_summary.md`.

 2. **Phase M1 instrumentation follow-up** — Augment the trace harness (if needed) to log 4×4×4 neighbourhood weights / `sincg` inputs alongside the existing traces, then update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` M1 guidance with the 20251008T070513Z audit path and the new metrics.

Compare against `nanoBragg.c` accumulation loops, implement the fix, and add a targeted pytest (`tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py::TestScalingParity::test_I_before_scaling_matches_c`).
