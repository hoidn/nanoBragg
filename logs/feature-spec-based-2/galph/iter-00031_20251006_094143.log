review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3b kick-off)
- `git pull --rebase` clean. Reviewed core docs + active plans + testing strategy per SOP.
- Goal 1: Phase H3 evidence (Attempt #21) now complete; updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to split H3 into H3a (done) and new H3b implementation task, and refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Next Actions to focus on applying the BEAM-pivot transform plus regression test.
- Goal 1 follow-up: Authored new input.md directing Ralph to implement the pix0 transform, add a targeted CLI regression test, capture artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`, and document Attempt #22 before moving to parity (Phase H4).
- Goal 2: Vectorization plan unchanged—Phase A evidence still outstanding; keep queued until CLI parity unblocks bandwidth.
- Coin flip = heads: reviewed Ralph’s latest evidence commits (`4e0e36e`, `0f18548`); both were productive (manual sincg rejection, pix0 reproduction) with no regressions.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: execute Phase H3b implementation per new memo, then proceed to H4 parity once regression test passes.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3b implementation prep)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; no upstream changes to reconcile. Coin flip → tails, so skipped retrospective commit audit per instructions.
- Refined `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` H3b guidance to spell out the projection workflow (`pix0_override - distance·beam` → F/S beam offsets, beam-centre tensor updates) and mandated artifact targets (`pix0_expected.json`, regression log, implementation notes).
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Next Actions to mirror the new projection math, regression expectations, and artifact checklist ahead of Attempt #22.
- Rewrote `input.md` (114 lines) directing Ralph to implement the BEAM-pivot transform, add the targeted pytest node, capture traces/logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`, and log Attempt #22 once complete.
- No code edits performed; awaiting Ralph’s implementation pass before moving to Phase H4 parity.
## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3b retargeted)
- Coin flip → tails; skipped retrospective review per SOP.
- Re-read required docs plus `plans/active/vectorization.md` and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`; long-term Goal 1 still blocked on pix0 override parity, Goal 2 remains queued until CLI parity settles.
- Evidence review: targeted pytest node now aborts during CLI parsing (missing `-default_F`), and manual Detector instantiation reproduces large X-component error (pix0 ≈1.19e-04 m vs C’s −0.2165 m). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` projection math yields F/S beams ≈0.2177/0.2139 m, driving unrealistic beam-centre tensors (~1.25e3 px) and failing to match C.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H3b to split into H3b1 (capture C/Py traces with/without override), H3b2 (mirror actual CUSTOM/BEAM mapping without projection), and H3b3 (fix CLI regression test). Annotated the phase with Attempt #22 failure context.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to align with the new H3b1–H3b3 scope (trace collection → implementation → regression test repair).

**Verifying latest log entries**
[2025-10-06T09:42:04] exec bash -lc 'tail -n 20 galph_memory.md' in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-06T09:42:05] bash -lc 'tail -n 20 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 734ms:
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H to split H4 into H4a/H4b/H4c with explicit artifacts, tolerance targets, and pytest expectations for the pix0 recomputation work.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions with the new H4a–H4c breakdown so the ledger points Ralph to the updated plan.
- Regenerated `input.md` (100 lines) instructing Ralph to execute CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H4a implementation, gather parity traces, tighten regression tolerances, and log Attempt #25 once complete.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: implement H4a per plan, capture parity evidence under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/`, tighten tests/test_cli_flags tolerance, and update docs/fix_plan.md with Attempt #25 metrics before moving to H4b.

## 2025-10-18 (galph loop — Phase H4 staging)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed CLI-FLAGS-003 plan/fix_plan, confirmed H4a–H4c remain the critical blocker for Goal 1.
- Pix0 mismatch analysis: PyTorch never mirrors nanoBragg.c’s post-rotation `newvector` projection, leaving Fbeam/Sbeam stale (≈3.9 mm Y delta). High confidence that porting lines 1822–1859 plus refreshing `distance_corrected` will close parity.
- Secondary watch-outs: ensure recompute updates cached beam centres/geometry and maintains MOSFLM +0.5 offsets; tighten regression tolerance to 5e-5 m once traces align.
- Vectorization plan (`plans/active/vectorization.md`) reviewed—structure is sound, but Phase A evidence capture still outstanding before Ralph touches tricubic refactor.
- docs/fix_plan.md now 1080 lines; flagged the need for a future archival pass once CLI parity lands.
- Regenerated `input.md` (Implementation phase) directing Ralph to execute CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H4a–H4c, capture parity_after_lattice_fix traces, and rerun the targeted pytest node; added fallback trace harness guidance.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: implement the `newvector` recompute exactly as in C, refresh traces + summary, tighten test tolerance, log Attempt #25, then proceed to polarization (Phase I) after supervisor review.
## 2025-10-18 (galph loop — Phase I staging)
- Marked CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H4 complete in plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md and updated the snapshot to focus on Phase I polarization; H4a–H4c rows now reference Attempt #25 artifacts under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/.
- Synced docs/fix_plan.md: CLI-FLAGS-003 status now calls out Phase A-H done with Phase I pending; Next Actions rewritten for polarization Attempt #26 and exit-criteria item (xi) flipped to ✅.
- Noted root cause for remaining parity gap: PyTorch BeamConfig defaults polarization_factor=0.0 while nanoBragg.c uses 1.0 (golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308); Ralph must realign defaults and capture new traces/tests.
- Regenerated input.md (Phase: Implementation) directing Ralph to execute Phase I (I1–I3), add a CLI polarization regression test, rerun targeted pytest nodes, and stash evidence under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/.
- Vectorization plan untouched; Phase A baseline capture still pending once CLI parity clears.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: implement polarization parity per plan, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #26 with metrics, and only then advance to nb-compare / vectorization work.

# nanoBragg Spec A — Core Engine

This shard contains the normative physics, geometry, sampling, and data handling requirements. CLI flag semantics live in [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md); cross-implementation profiles and developer tooling are captured in [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md).

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

This shard enumerates the CLI profile acceptance tests, parallel validation suite, developer tooling expectations, and conformance profiles. Review [spec-a-core.md](spec-a-core.md) for base requirements and [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md) for CLI semantics referenced here.

Parallel Validation Tests (Profile: C-PyTorch Equivalence) — Acceptance Tests (Normative)

References: ../docs/development/testing_strategy.md (parallel trace-driven validation), ../docs/debugging/debugging.md (trace SOP), ../docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (detector geometry triage), ../docs/architecture/undocumented_conventions.md (hidden C behaviors)
Why: testing_strategy and debugging.md define the parallel trace methodology; the detector checklist accelerates geometry debugging; undocumented_conventions flags hidden C behaviors that often break equivalence.

These tests verify that PyTorch implementation produces outputs equivalent to the C reference implementation. They apply to implementations claiming the C-PyTorch Equivalence Profile. These are black-box behavioral tests comparing outputs without examining internal implementation details.

- AT-PARALLEL-001 Beam Center Scales with Detector Size
  - Setup: Test detector sizes 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024 pixels with 0.1mm pixel size, cubic crystal 100Å N=3, λ=6.2Å
  - Expectation: Beam center (mm) SHALL equal detector_pixels/2 × pixel_size_mm; Peak SHALL appear at detector center ±2 pixels; Correlation between C and PyTorch ≥0.9999
  - Failure mode: Fixed beam center at 51.2mm regardless of detector size
  - Implementation:

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: Drive Phase I in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (I1) audit polarization inputs vs nanoBragg.c 2080-2155, (I2) port the Kahn factor into the simulator with device/dtype neutrality, (I3) rerun the supervisor command with polarization enabled, archive logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/`, and record Attempt #26 with metrics.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #26 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase I polarization defaults complete). **BeamConfig.polarization_factor default aligned with C polar=1.0.**
    Metrics: CLI polarization tests 3/3 passed. Core tests: cli_flags 26/26, detector_geometry 12/12, crystal_geometry 19/19 (57 passed, 1 warning). Test collection: 632 tests collected.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483-487` - Updated polarization_factor default from 0.0 to 1.0 with C reference citation
      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py:591-675` - Added TestCLIPolarization class with 3 tests (default parity, -nopolar flag, -polar override)
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Root Cause Fixed:** PyTorch was defaulting to polarization_factor=0.0 instead of matching C's polar=1.0
      - **C Reference:** golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308-309 sets polar=1.0, polarization=0.0, nopolar=0

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

**Gathering context on plan status and goals**

I'm reviewing the codebase and related plans to understand progress and next steps for long-term goals, particularly final parity in Phase I3 and vectorization readiness. To do this, I'll examine fix_plan and input.md to confirm what's pending and what instructions Ralph has for the final command run.

Summary: Close CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase I by aligning polarization defaults and parity with nanoBragg.c.
Phase: Implementation
Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase I polarization)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity | tests/test_at_parallel_011.py::TestATParallel011PolarizationFactor::test_polarized_kahn_model
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase I polarization — author targeted CLI polarization parity test, then run env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPolarization::test_default_polarization_parity -v
If Blocked: Capture evidence via KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --mode polarization --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/blocked && log findings in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/blocked.md before paging supervisor.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:119 keeps Phase I (I1–I3) as the final blocker; follow each task sequentially.
  - Re-read Phase I goal statement to ensure the CLI command parity criteria are satisfied before closing the plan.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:108 summarises Phase H artifacts; reuse those traces as baseline when comparing polarization on/off.
  - The parity_after_lattice_fix summary proves geometry parity with -nopolar, which Phase I artifacts must extend.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 records CLI-FLAGS-003 status now waiting for Attempt #26; evidence must update this ledger entry with polarization metrics.
  - Note the updated Next Actions already reference Phase I, so deliverables must target polarization.
- docs/fix_plan.md:859 highlights exit criteria with Phase H marked complete; only polarization and nb-compare remain unchecked.
  - Ensure Attempt #26 flips those ❌ entries to ✅.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308 shows C defaults polar=1.0/polarization=0.0; mismatched PyTorch defaults explain the ~0.09 trace gap.
  - Keep this reference handy when writing Attempt #26 notes or commit message.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3254-3290 documents polarization_factor; mirror its vector math when verifying tensor implementation.

    BeamConfig.polarization_factor now defaults to 1.0 to match nanoBragg.c:308
    polar=1.0 initialization. Previously defaulted to 0.0, causing polarization

      with C reference citation
    - tests/test_cli_flags.py:591-675 — Added TestCLIPolarization class with

    - plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md — Marked Phase I tasks I1-I2 complete

# nanoBragg C Parameter Dictionary

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a definitive reference for all command-line parameters accepted by `nanoBragg.c`. It maps each command-line flag to its corresponding internal C variable, specifies its data type, expected units, default value, and provides a clear description of its function.

**Note:** For a direct mapping of these C parameters to their PyTorch Config equivalents and a guide to implicit conventions, see the **[C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](../development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md)**. That document is essential for understanding:
- How C-CLI flags map to PyTorch dataclass fields
- Implicit behavior (e.g., `-twotheta` setting pivot mode to SAMPLE)
- Convention-dependent adjustments (e.g., MOSFLM beam center calculations)
- Common configuration bugs and their prevention

This dictionary is essential for:
*   Understanding how to configure a `nanoBragg` simulation.
*   Guiding the implementation of a new configuration system (e.g., Python `dataclasses`).
*   Debugging by tracing user input to its effect in the code.

**Note on Conventions:** The C code handles multiple geometry conventions (e.g., MOSFLM, XDS) via conditional logic. The PyTorch architecture will use a single, canonical internal coordinate system. The user-facing command-line interface will be responsible for parsing legacy convention flags and converting them into the application's canonical parameter set before the simulation begins.

**Formulating final parity plan updates**

I'm piecing together hypotheses about polarization axis differences and noise effects to explain parity issues with the C version. I want to expand the fix_plan document’s Next Actions to include precise commands for running the PyTorch CLI with environment variables, capturing outputs, and comparing results to C outputs—helping clarify the phase I3 final parity steps for Ralph. I'll prepare a python-based script approach to carefully update that docs/fix_plan.md section while avoiding formatting issues.

- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: Drive Phase I in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (I1) audit polarization inputs vs nanoBragg.c 2080-2155, (I2) port the Kahn factor into the simulator with device/dtype neutrality, (I3) rerun the supervisor command with polarization enabled, archive logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/`, and record Attempt #26 with metrics.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #26 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase I polarization defaults complete). **BeamConfig.polarization_factor default aligned with C polar=1.0.**
    Metrics: CLI polarization tests 3/3 passed. Core tests: cli_flags 26/26, detector_geometry 12/12, crystal_geometry 19/19 (57 passed, 1 warning). Test collection: 632 tests collected.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:483-487` - Updated polarization_factor default from 0.0 to 1.0 with C reference citation
      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py:591-675` - Added TestCLIPolarization class with 3 tests (default parity, -nopolar flag, -polar override)
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Root Cause Fixed:** PyTorch was defaulting to polarization_factor=0.0 instead of matching C's polar=1.0
      - **C Reference:** golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308-309 sets polar=1.0, polarization=0.0, nopolar=0
      - **Test Coverage:** Validates default matches C (1.0), -nopolar flag behavior, and -polar <value> override
      - **Phase I Tasks:** I1 (audit) ✅, I2 (implement) ✅; I3 (final parity sweep) remains pending

Validation Scripts

Purpose
- Centralize reproducible validation and parity helpers invoked from prompts and supervisor input.

Guidelines
- Prefer small, composable scripts that wrap canonical pytest nodes or nb-compare flows.
- Accept configuration via CLI args and environment variables documented in docs/development/testing_strategy.md.
- Do not assume editable installs are absent; rely on the package being installed in editable mode.
- Keep scripts device/dtype neutral and avoid hard-coded paths.

Examples (future)
- Add targeted wrappers such as `run_parity_case.py` or `emit_metrics.py` as needed by the plan.

**Preparing structured input.md content**

I'm planning to build the input.md file as a carefully formatted string in Python, including sections for summary, pitfalls to avoid, pointers, next steps, and a detailed "How-To Map" with commands listed clearly. I want to keep commands on one line for readability and align with the instructions about line limits and formatting.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

**Summarizing invocation in memory update**

I’ll note plan updates, follow-up instructions for Ralph, and the current state of uncommitted changes, all formatted consistently with previous entries.

Highest-confidence risk is #1; next step is the nb-compare command recorded in input.md (correlation + polarization metrics).
- No new plan drafted—`plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` remains authoritative. Updated docs/fix_plan.md next actions to focus on Attempt #27 parity run and deepened I3 guidance.
- Regenerated input.md (143 lines, Validation phase) instructing Ralph to run nb-compare with the supervisor command, archive artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/`, execute targeted pytest, and document Attempt #27 metrics.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: execute Do Now nb-compare command, capture stdout/stderr + summary.json, run targeted pytest + collect-only, update README + docs/fix_plan Attempt #27, leave code untouched.

[2025-10-06T09:53:55] bash -lc 'tail -n 20 galph_memory.md' succeeded in 727ms:
- Secondary watch-outs: ensure recompute updates cached beam centres/geometry and maintains MOSFLM +0.5 offsets; tighten regression tolerance to 5e-5 m once traces align.
- Vectorization plan (`plans/active/vectorization.md`) reviewed—structure is sound, but Phase A evidence capture still outstanding before Ralph touches tricubic refactor.
- docs/fix_plan.md now 1080 lines; flagged the need for a future archival pass once CLI parity lands.
- Regenerated `input.md` (Implementation phase) directing Ralph to execute CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H4a–H4c, capture parity_after_lattice_fix traces, and rerun the targeted pytest node; added fallback trace harness guidance.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: implement the `newvector` recompute exactly as in C, refresh traces + summary, tighten test tolerance, log Attempt #25, then proceed to polarization (Phase I) after supervisor review.
## 2025-10-18 (galph loop — Phase I staging)
- Marked CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H4 complete in plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md and updated the snapshot to focus on Phase I polarization; H4a–H4c rows now reference Attempt #25 artifacts under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/.
- Synced docs/fix_plan.md: CLI-FLAGS-003 status now calls out Phase A-H done with Phase I pending; Next Actions rewritten for polarization Attempt #26 and exit-criteria item (xi) flipped to ✅.
- Noted root cause for remaining parity gap: PyTorch BeamConfig defaults polarization_factor=0.0 while nanoBragg.c uses 1.0 (golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:308); Ralph must realign defaults and capture new traces/tests.
- Regenerated input.md (Phase: Implementation) directing Ralph to execute Phase I (I1–I3), add a CLI polarization regression test, rerun targeted pytest nodes, and stash evidence under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/.
- Vectorization plan untouched; Phase A baseline capture still pending once CLI parity clears.
- Follow-ups for Ralph: implement polarization parity per plan, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #26 with metrics, and only then advance to nb-compare / vectorization work.

## 2025-10-19 (galph loop — Phase I3 parity directive)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; workspace already on feature/spec-based-2. Reviewed prior memory plus required docs (spec-a shards, arch.md, config map, debugging guide, testing strategy, fix_plan, docs/index).
- Long-term goal sweep: CLI parity stalled only on Phase I3; vectorization plan Phases A–F untouched pending parity evidence. `_tricubic_interpolation` still falls back to nearest-neighbour for batched tensors, reinforcing urgency once CLI closes.

**Phase I3 Parity**
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md:455` so CLI-FLAGS-003 now points squarely at Attempt #27: rerun the supervisor command via nb-compare, stash artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/`, and log closure metrics.
- Rebuilt `input.md` (143 lines, Validation phase) detailing the exact nb-compare invocation, artifact layout, pytest follow-up, and evidence checklist Ralph must follow this loop.
- Logged the new supervisor context in `galph_memory.md` (2025‑10‑19 entry) so future turns know Phase I3 parity is the lone blocker before vectorization work.
- Parity hypotheses triaged: (1) polarization may still diverge if CLI routing misses BeamConfig defaults (most likely—nb-compare run will confirm); (2) `-nonoise` path might still emit `noiseimage.img`; (3) pix0 suppression with custom vectors must mirror C. Next confirming step for all three is the nb-compare command captured in Do Now.
- No new plan opened; existing `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase I remains authoritative. Vectorization plan stays on hold until Attempt #27 succeeds.

Next steps for Ralph: execute the nb-compare Do Now command, archive stdout/stderr + summary.json, run the targeted CLI polarization pytest alongside `pytest --collect-only`, and record Attempt #27 in `docs/fix_plan.md` with correlation, RMSE, peak and polarization metrics.
