</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

- Noted Fdump snapshots currently in repo do not cover (-7,-1,-14); follow-up question recorded for L3b to locate/replicate C’s data source.
- Follow-up for Ralph: implement the probe per input.md, store outputs in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/structure_factor/, and feed findings into L3b planning.


## 2025-11-15 (galph loop — Phase L3 structure-factor sourcing)
- Confirmed repo-local `scaled.hkl` is a 13-byte stub containing only `(1,12,3)`; golden_suite_generator/Fdump.bin and tmp/Fdump.bin are tiny (≤2×2×2 grids) and cannot supply F_cell for (-7,-1,-14).
- Loaded `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` via `read_fdump`; grid spans h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30] and returns `F_cell=190.27` for the supervisor pixel. This confirms sourcing the C-generated Fdump reproduces the trace amplitude.
- Implication: Phase L3 must treat the archived Fdump as the authoritative dataset (or regenerate an equivalent cache) before normalization work; running the CLI with the stub HKL will overwrite the cache with zeros.
- Next supervisor handoff: instruct Ralph to rerun `reports/.../structure_factor/probe.py` including `--fdump reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin`, capture the refreshed probe.log/analysis.md, and decide whether to stage that Fdump alongside the supervisor command or regenerate it from the original HKL source.

## 2025-11-16 (galph loop — VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 kickoff)
- Refreshed `plans/active/vectorization.md` Context/Phase A guidance to flag the Phase A evidence push (collect-only log, env snapshot) and reinforced harness locations under `scripts/benchmarks/`.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` next-actions list for VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 with the env.json + collect-only requirements so the fix-plan matches the plan.
- Authored input.md handing Ralph Phase A1–A3 tasks (capture tricubic/absorption baselines, build benchmark harnesses, persist logs in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`).
- Follow-up for Ralph: execute the outlined commands, write harness stubs, drop Attempt #1 evidence into fix_plan once artifacts exist, then proceed to Phase B design when Phase A closes.

## 2025-11-17 (galph loop — Phase A2/A3 planning refresh)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed core docs plus vectorization plan/fix_plan entries before analysis.
- Coin flip = heads → reviewed Ralph’s recent commits (142230b, 6e12854). Evidence collection and baseline logs look solid; no regressions spotted. Noted that tests/test_at_str_002.py and absorption logs already captured in reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/.
- Updated plans/active/vectorization.md gap snapshot and Phase A table to mark A1 complete and highlight missing A2/A3 harnesses.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-20 refresh):
  1. Phase L3g instrumentation — Extend the trace harness (or simulator TRACE_PY hooks) to emit raw + normalized `spindle_axis` vectors for the supervisor command, rerun the φ=0 trace, and append results to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log` alongside the volume table.
  2. Phase L3h doc/plan alignment — Once spindle evidence lands, update `rot_vector/analysis.md`, this plan entry, and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` with the chosen corrective approach before green-lighting simulator edits.
  3. Phase L4 parity rerun — After the spindle normalization fix is implemented and documentation refreshed, execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics (correlation ≥0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01), archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #91 (ralph loop i=91) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L3g spindle instrumentation COMPLETE). **H1 (spindle normalization) RULED OUT as root cause of Y-drift.**
    Metrics: Spindle Δ(magnitude)=0.0 (tolerance ≤5e-4); trace captured 43 TRACE_PY lines (was 40, +3 spindle lines); test collection 4/4 passed.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:1313-1322` - Spindle instrumentation (emit raw/normalized/magnitude)

- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`

  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-20 refresh):
 1. Execute Phase C1 — implement the batched `(B,4,4,4)` gather per design_notes §2 and capture rationale/validation snippets in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/gather_notes.md` before running the updated tests.
 2. Execute Phase C2 — add/extend the targeted pytest (`tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire`) to confirm the warning fires once and interpolation disables; store the `pytest -k oob_warning -v` log under `phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.log`.
 3. Execute Phase C3 — add shape assertions + device-aware caching, record findings in `phase_c/implementation_notes.md`, and attach the post-assertion `pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled -v` output as evidence.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

PY" succeeded in 738ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3g: Spindle-axis instrumentation complete - H1 ruled out
    
    Added TRACE_PY spindle instrumentation (simulator.py:1313-1322) to emit raw/normalized/magnitude.
    Reran φ=0 trace (43 TRACE_PY lines, +3 spindle lines). Evidence shows Δ(magnitude)=0.0 (tolerance ≤5e-4).
    
    Key findings:
    - Spindle vectors identical: Raw=[-1.0,0.0,0.0], Normalized=[-1.0,0.0,0.0], Magnitude=1.0
    - H1 (spindle normalization) RULED OUT: unitize() is no-op for exact unit vector
    - H3 (MOSFLM matrix semantics) promoted to primary suspect
    - Test suite: 31/31 geometry tests passed, 5/5 trace tests passed

**Deciding planning focus and action type**

I'm analyzing recent commit history and project status to decide whether a new plan is needed or if existing plans require updates, especially focusing on the truncated vectorization plan Phase C. Given the evidence, I lean toward choosing a planning action centered on refreshing and completing the vectorization plan's Phase C, since it impacts long-term goals and progress. Next, I'll review relevant documentation to gather required details before drafting the plan.

## Executive Summary

This memo defines the tensor shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient/device requirements for vectorizing the tricubic interpolation pipeline in nanoBragg PyTorch. The current scalar-only implementation (≈5.5 ms/call on CUDA, ≈1.4 ms/call on CPU per Phase A baselines) limits performance when processing batched detector pixels. Vectorization will eliminate Python loops over neighborhood gathering and polynomial evaluation, enabling GPU parallelism and torch.compile optimization.

**Evaluating plan completeness and next steps**

I'm reviewing the full plan to confirm its compliance with instructions and whether it needs updates, especially around unresolved issues like the MOSFLM vector mismatch. I’m weighing if the current plan suffices or if expanding tasks for deeper analysis and evidence collection is necessary to guide future debugging efforts.
[2025-10-07T11:24:47] exec bash -lc "sed -n '1,120p' plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md" in /Users/ollie/Documents/nanoBragg3
[2025-10-07T11:24:48] bash -lc "sed -n '1,120p' plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md" succeeded in 967ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

**Assessing plan gaps and gathering docs**

I'm noticing the current plan detailed instrumentation but lacks clear next steps for fixing the MOSFLM vector issue. It looks like I need to update the plan to include new analysis tasks before proceeding to code changes. To do that, I'll review specific documentation around CLI flags and detector flow—starting with specs/spec-a-cli.md—to build a solid rationale for the plan update.

I’m sorting out how to update the plan files to address the MOSFLM real vector mismatch issue, considering adding new sub-phases and tasks within Phase L3 while preserving existing naming conventions. I’m also checking the fix_plan entries to ensure consistency with Next Actions and thinking about referencing relevant docs to capture the specifics needed for these new steps.

# Rotation Vector φ=0 Drift Analysis

## Executive Summary

Phase L3f rotation-vector audit reveals component-level discrepancies in real-space vectors at φ=0 while reciprocal vectors remain highly aligned. Key finding: **Y-component drift in all three real-space vectors (0.04-6.8% deltas)** explains the k_frac offset observed in Phase L2c/L3e.

## Key Metrics

### Metric Duality (from invariant_probe.md)
- **Volume discrepancy**: +3.35e-03 Å³ (+0.000014%)
- **a·a* deviation**: -6.264e-04 (C=1.000626, Py=1.000000)
- **b·b* deviation**: +4.414e-04 (C=0.999559, Py=1.000000)
- **c·c* deviation**: +1.872e-04 (C=0.999813, Py=1.000000)

**Interpretation**: PyTorch achieves near-perfect metric duality (a·a* ≈ 1.0 within 7.5e-05) as required by crystallographic convention. C implementation shows O(1e-3) deviations from unity, suggesting accumulated numerical drift in the reciprocal-space recalculation pipeline.

**Devising detailed plan updates**

I’m mapping out precise plan modifications for new harness tasks, focusing on adding instrumentation scripts and documentation steps while updating the L3 task table in the plan. I’ll script these textual edits to carefully insert new rows and revise guidance, keeping everything aligned with existing styles and ensuring later phases don’t creep in prematurely.

| G1 | Extend CLI config to retain A* vectors | [D] | ✅ Commit 28fc584 stores MOSFLM reciprocal vectors from `-mat` in `parse_and_validate_args` and threads them into `CrystalConfig`; 26-case CLI regression sweep captured in Attempt #15 notes. |
| G2 | Teach `Crystal` to ingest orientation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #17 (ralph). Modified `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors()` (lines 545-603) to detect MOSFLM orientation in config, convert to tensors with proper device/dtype, and integrate with Core Rules 12-13 pipeline. Tests: 26/26 passed (CLI), 35/35 passed (crystal). Metric duality perfect. Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/README.md`. |
| G3 | Trace verification + parity rerun | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #18 (ralph). Fixed MOSFLM matrix transpose bug (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/mosflm.py:88`). Reciprocal vectors now match C exactly (9/9 components to 16 decimals). Miller indices match: (2,2,-13). F_cell perfect match: 300.58. Real vectors within 0.05Å (<0.2% error). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation_fixed.md`, `traces/trace_c.log`, `traces/trace_py_fixed.log`. Intensity parity still divergent (deferred to Phase H polarization). |

### Phase H — Lattice Structure Factor Alignment
Goal: Ensure the CLI-provided beam vector propagates through Detector→Simulator and bring scattering/lattice parity back in line before polarization work.
Prereqs: Phases F and G complete; orientation traces captured (Phase G3 artifacts in place).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison shows `pix0_vector` components matching C within 5e-5 m, `h`, `k`, `l` fractional components within 1e-3, `F_latt_a/b/c` within 0.5% (signed), and a parity rerun demonstrates ≥0.95 correlation improvement attributable to lattice fixes (polarization still disabled).

Update 2025-10-17: Attempt #22 proved the projection-based override mapping pushes pix0 off by 2.16e-1 m; Attempt #23 (now superseded) inferred the C code ignored `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom detector vectors are present. Phase J traces captured on 2025-10-21 demonstrate the override IS honoured (C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` ≈0.2179/0.2139 m), so PyTorch must re-apply overrides even in the custom-vector path.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | Refresh trace evidence post-orientation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py` + `trace_comparison.md` captured the no-override trace and logged Attempt #19 (beam vector divergence documented). |
| H2 | Fix incident beam propagation from CLI | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #20 (ralph). Simulator now clones `detector.beam_vector` (commit 8c1583d); regression covered by `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIBeamVector::test_custom_beam_vector_propagates`. Pending: rerun `phase_h/trace_harness.py` to confirm `incident_vec` parity before Phase H3. |
| H3a | Diagnose residual lattice mismatch | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #21 (ralph). `trace_py_after_H3_refresh.log`, `pix0_reproduction.md`, and `implementation_notes.md` quantify the ~1.14 mm pix0 delta and show the cascade into scattering vector and `F_latt` disparities; `attempt_log.txt` restored with evidence summary. |
| H3b1 | Capture C vs PyTorch pix0/F/S references (override on/off) | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #23: Stored paired C traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/c_trace_with_override.log` / `_without_override.log`), PyTorch traces, and `pix0_mapping_analysis.md`; evidence proves C geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are supplied. |
| H3b2 | Implement pix0 precedence (custom vectors > override) | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #24 (commit d6f158c). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now skips overrides when any custom detector vector is supplied; override logic only executes in the no-custom-vectors path. Validation: `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot` (CPU) and evidence log `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_override_validation.md`. Residual pix0 Y-delta (≈3.9 mm) traced to missing post-rotation `Fbeam/Sbeam` recomputation and deferred to H4. |
| H3b3 | Repair CLI regression + artifacts for precedence | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #24. Regression test now covers BOTH precedence cases (custom vectors ignored, standard path applies override) and records expected C pix0 vector in `pix0_expected.json`. CUDA parametrisation remains skipped until parity fix lands; tolerance temporarily relaxed to 5 mm pending H4 geometry alignment. |
| H4a | Port post-rotation beam-centre recomputation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #25: Ported nanoBragg.c lines 1846-1860 into `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector`; see `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/implementation.md`. |

Prereqs: Phase D3 report published; C binary ready for instrumentation (`NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison identifies first divergent variable; findings logged in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_comparison.md` and summarized in docs/fix_plan.md `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Attempts.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E0 | Verify beam vector parity | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-16: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/beam_vector_check.txt` shows PyTorch Detector beam direction `[0., 0., 1.]` vs C trace override `[0.00051387949, 0, -0.99999986]`; confirms CLI wiring gap. |
| E1 | Instrument C trace for peak pixel | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-16: `c_trace_beam.log` captured via instrumented binary (pixel 1039,685) with pix0, beam, scattering, h/k/l, F_latt entries. |
| E2 | Generate matching PyTorch trace | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-16: `pytorch_trace_beam.log` generated with `trace_harness.py` (double precision). Harness currently overrides beam vector manually to mimic the supervisor command. |

**Updating documentation and task list**

I’ll handle the text modifications programmatically with Python.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-20 refresh → updated by galph):
  1. Phase L3h MOSFLM probe — Refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py` (or TRACE_PY hooks) to dump MOSFLM reciprocal vectors before/after PyTorch’s reconstruction, rerun the supervisor command (`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python .../trace_harness.py --out mosflm_matrix_probe.log`), and capture deltas in `rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.md` with pytest collect log + SHA metadata.
  2. Phase L3i corrective memo — Use the probe results to author `rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_correction.md`, update `analysis.md`, and refresh this plan entry with the chosen fix strategy (cite nanoBragg.c lines for the reciprocal→real pipeline). Log a new Attempt once the memo lands.
  3. Phase L3j implementation checklist — Before code changes, build `rot_vector/fix_checklist.md` outlining verification steps (trace harness, `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py -k lattice`, nb-compare ROI) and tolerances (≤1e-6 relative). Once these are ready, schedule the implementation loop leading into Phase L4 parity rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #91 (ralph loop i=91) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L3g spindle instrumentation COMPLETE). **H1 (spindle normalization) RULED OUT as root cause of Y-drift.**
    Metrics: Spindle Δ(magnitude)=0.0 (tolerance ≤5e-4); trace captured 43 TRACE_PY lines (was 40, +3 spindle lines); test collection 4/4 passed.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:1313-1322` - Spindle instrumentation (emit raw/normalized/magnitude)
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log` - Refreshed φ=0 trace with spindle data

- `pytest --collect-only -q` after instrumentation to confirm selectors are intact; log the output to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect_latest.log`.
- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.md` with side-by-side tables (C vs PyTorch) for: raw MOSFLM a*/b*/c*, post-misset real vectors, rederived a*/b*/c*, and highlight the Y-component drift.

**Planning detailed multi-line list expansion**

I’m figuring out how to expand this text to between 100-200 lines by breaking bullets into multiple lines with sub-bullets and descriptions. I’ll structure sections like Priorities, How-To Map, Pitfalls, and Pointers with expanded multi-line entries to reach about 120 lines, making sure the content is clear and detailed while monitoring line count as I build.

Summary: Capture MOSFLM matrix evidence to unblock the scaling parity fix.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_correction.md (draft skeleton); reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3h MOSFLM probe — `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.log`
If Blocked: Capture the blocking reason in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.md` (Attempts section) and run `pytest --collect-only -q` to validate the environment before pinging supervisor.
Context Reminders:
- Long-term goal #1 hinges on this parity work; no nb-compare rerun until L3h–L3j close.
- Supervisor command parameters are recorded in prompts/supervisor.md; replicate them verbatim.
- Attempt #91 established spindle parity; reuse its formatting when adding new TRACE lines.
- All new evidence must live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` so the plan references stay valid.
- Current first divergence: `I_before_scaling` because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14).
- The probe should reveal where MOSFLM real-vector reconstruction diverges from nanoBragg.c.
Priorities & Rationale:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md: Append MOSFLM probe metrics to maintain a single source of truth for L3 evidence.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/scaling_validation_summary.md: Keep the ≤1e-6 tolerance context visible while analysing new numbers.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:50: Re-read BEAM pivot math before interpreting pix0 outputs.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:118: Revisit SAMPLE pivot semantics in case traces reveal implicit pivot flips.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
-- Next Actions (2025-11-20 refresh):
-  1. Phase L3g instrumentation — Extend the trace harness (or simulator TRACE_PY hooks) to emit raw + normalized `spindle_axis` vectors for the supervisor command, rerun the φ=0 trace, and append results to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log` alongside the volume table.
-  2. Phase L3h doc/plan alignment — Once spindle evidence lands, update `rot_vector/analysis.md`, this plan entry, and `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` with the chosen corrective approach before green-lighting simulator edits.
-  3. Phase L4 parity rerun — After the spindle normalization fix is implemented and documentation refreshed, execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics (correlation ≥0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01), archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
+- Next Actions (2025-11-20 refresh → updated by galph):
+  1. Phase L3h MOSFLM probe — Refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py` (or TRACE_PY hooks) to dump MOSFLM reciprocal vectors before/after PyTorch’s reconstruction, rerun the supervisor command (`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python .../trace_harness.py --out mosflm_matrix_probe.log`), and capture deltas in `rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.md` with pytest collect log + SHA metadata.
+  2. Phase L3i corrective memo — Use the probe results to author `rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_correction.md`, update `analysis.md`, and refresh this plan entry with the chosen fix strategy (cite nanoBragg.c lines for the reciprocal→real pipeline). Log a new Attempt once the memo lands.
+  3. Phase L3j implementation checklist — Before code changes, build `rot_vector/fix_checklist.md` outlining verification steps (trace harness, `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py -k lattice`, nb-compare ROI) and tolerances (≤1e-6 relative). Once these are ready, schedule the implementation loop leading into Phase L4 parity rerun.

| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [D] | ✅ Attempt #71 refreshed `scaling_audit_summary.md` via `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`, highlighting `I_before_scaling` as the first divergence (C=9.4365e5, Py=0) while all downstream scaling factors match within 2e-3%. This establishes that the remaining gap stems from missing structure-factor coverage rather than normalization math. |

### Phase L3 — Normalization Fix Implementation
Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

Re-run the supervisor command with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_harness.py --out mosflm_matrix_probe.log` (update script if needed). Summarize C vs PyTorch deltas in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_probe.md`, highlighting where the real-vector pipeline diverges (expected: reciprocal match O(1e-9), real Y-component drift). Include SHA/timestamp + pytest --collect-only log. |
| L3i | Document corrective approach | [ ] | Draft `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/mosflm_matrix_correction.md` capturing the root cause, the exact nanoBragg.c lines that reconstruct real vectors, and the required PyTorch changes (misset application order, reciprocal→real→reciprocal sequence). Update `rot_vector/analysis.md` and this plan with the chosen fix strategy. Log Attempt in `docs/fix_plan.md` once the memo exists. |
| L3j | Implementation readiness checklist | [ ] | Before touching simulator/crystal code, author `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md` enumerating tests (trace harness, `pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py -k lattice`, nb-compare ROI) and verification thresholds (≤1e-6 relative). Ensure doc references (specs/spec-a-core.md §4, CLAUDE rules 12/13) are cited so the subsequent implementation loop has an actionable checklist. |

### Phase L4 — Supervisor Command Parity Rerun
Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end parity for the supervisor command (correlation ≥ 0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01, mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px) and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
Prereqs: L3 validation artifacts show ≤1e-6 deltas for scaling factors; regression tests green.
Exit Criteria: nb-compare metrics meet thresholds, artifacts stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/supervisor_command_rerun/`, docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #56 documents the pass, and this plan is ready for archival.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L4a | Rerun supervisor command parity | [ ] | Execute the authoritative command from `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_i/supervisor_command/README.md`, writing outputs to a new timestamped directory. Capture `summary.json`, stdout/stderr, and SHA256 hashes. |

**Preparing final summary message**

I'm putting together a clear final message that explains the plan updates with file details, references the fix_plan next actions, notes the new input.md file creation, outlines what Ralph should do next, and includes the commit ID and expectations for the resulting artifacts. This will help the user see a concise wrap-up of what was done and what comes next.
[2025-10-07T11:32:04] codex

Updated the CLI parity plan so Phase L3 now has concrete MOSFLM follow-up tasks: a new probe, corrective memo, and pre-implementation checklist (see `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:268`–`270`). Fixed the matching Next Actions in the ledger so Ralph’s queue points straight at those deliverables (`docs/fix_plan.md:460`–`463`). Rewrote `input.md` with a parity-mode brief (100 lines) that walks Ralph through capturing `mosflm_matrix_probe.log/md`, logging environment details, and drafting the correction/checklist artifacts before any simulator edits. Commit: 3232549 (tests: not run).

**Next steps for Ralph**
1. Run the updated trace harness to produce `mosflm_matrix_probe.log` and document the deltas in `mosflm_matrix_probe.md`, including env metadata and pytest collect output.  
2. Use that evidence to draft `mosflm_matrix_correction.md` and populate `fix_checklist.md`; log a new Attempt entry once those drafts exist.
