</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# nanoBragg Spec A — Core Engine

This shard contains the normative physics, geometry, sampling, and data handling requirements. CLI flag semantics live in [spec-a-cli.md](spec-a-cli.md); cross-implementation profiles and developer tooling are captured in [spec-a-parallel.md](spec-a-parallel.md).

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

### Crystal Parameters

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-14): Attempt #73 showed `Crystal.hkl_data` unset (leading to `F_cell=0`), keeping L2b open; **Attempt #74 fixed this by wiring the HKL tensor/metadata before Simulator construction.**
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md.
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-18): Phase A1–A3 evidence captured under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` (pytest logs plus tricubic/absorption baselines). **Phase B design memo landed in Attempt #3 (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) covering tensor shapes, polynomial mapping, and gradient/device checklists.** Next blocker is executing Phase C implementation tasks using that design as the contract.
- Supervisory note (2025-11-18 → refreshed 2025-11-18b): fix_plan#VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 now pivots to Phase C execution (tasks C1–C3). Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` exported, reuse the design memo’s Section 2/3 diagrams, and stage changes behind feature-flag-friendly commits to ease review if batching becomes necessary.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-20): No code changes have landed since the design memo; Phase C remains unstarted. The updated guidance below locks in artifact destinations (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/`) and reproduction commands so Ralph can take the first implementation step without further supervisor clarification.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` and `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`). Key finding: scalar-only implementation @ ~1.4 ms/call (CPU), ~5.5 ms/call (CUDA). |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-07 (`scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` created; CPU & CUDA baselines captured in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`). GPU shows 5.4× speedup for 512² detector. |

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-19 refresh):
  1. Phase L3f rotation-vector audit — Capture aligned `TRACE_C` vs `TRACE_PY` rot-vector dumps for φ=0 using the updated harness, write `rot_vector_comparison.md` under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/`, and quantify Δ components that explain the `k_frac` offset (target <5e-4).
  2. Phase L3g hypothesis framing — Summarize likely causes of the φ=0 drift (spindle axis, reciprocal reconstitution, phi step sizing) in `rot_vector/analysis.md`, cite supporting traces, and update this plan/fix_plan before touching simulator code.
  3. Phase L4 parity rerun — After alignment fixes land and documentation is refreshed, execute the supervisor command end-to-end, capture nb-compare metrics (correlation ≥0.9995, sum_ratio 0.99–1.01), archive results, and close CLI-FLAGS-003.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-11-13] Attempt #71 (ralph loop) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L2b validation + Phase L2c complete). **Harness already functional from Attempt #69; executed comparison script to identify first divergence.**
    Metrics: 40 TRACE_PY lines captured; test suite passes 4/4 variants (cpu/cuda × float32/float64). Comparison identifies `I_before_scaling` as first divergent factor (C=943654.809, PyTorch=0, -100% delta).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_py_scaling.log:1-41` - Refreshed trace with live values (polar=0.91464138, omega_pixel=4.20404859e-07 sr, F_cell=0, I_before_scaling=0)

I plan to inspect related documents like fix_plan—especially the VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 section—and gather sufficient context before moving to the coin-flip step.

- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).

 1. Execute Phase C1 — implement the batched `(B,4,4,4)` gather per design_notes §2 and capture rationale/validation snippets in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_c/gather_notes.md` before running the updated tests.
 2. Execute Phase C2 — add/extend the targeted pytest (`tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py::test_oob_warning_single_fire`) to confirm the warning fires once and interpolation disables; store the `pytest -k oob_warning -v` log under `phase_c/test_tricubic_vectorized.log`.
 3. Execute Phase C3 — add shape assertions + device-aware caching, record findings in `phase_c/implementation_notes.md`, and attach the post-assertion `pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py::test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled -v` output as evidence.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.
    Metrics: AT-STR-002: 3/3 tests passed in 2.12s (test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled, test_tricubic_out_of_bounds_fallback, test_auto_enable_interpolation). AT-ABS-001: 5/5 tests passed in 5.88s. Collection: 3 tricubic tests found.

**Evaluating progress and planning next steps**

I'm reviewing the instructions carefully and identifying current gaps like CLI parity issues and ongoing normalization work. Next, I'll flip a coin in Python via shell to decide whether to review recent commits, aligning with the stepwise plan. Let's focus on completing deep analysis before moving on.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

**Evaluating next steps for rotation vector audit**

I'm figuring out whether to update the plan or gather evidence for the rotation vector audit task. Since the plan already includes related tasks, I want to check if it needs refinement or if reviewing documentation might clarify what instructions Ralph needs next. I'll dig into the plan's Phase L sections to see how detailed the current tasks are before deciding on planning or evidence collection.

[2025-10-07T10:48:04] bash -lc 'rg "Phase L" -n plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md' succeeded in 1.01s:
10:- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
11:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
12:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
13:- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
15:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
18:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-15): Attempts #69/#71/#74 finished Phase L2 — TRACE_PY now reports real scaling factors, `scaling_audit_summary.md` flags `I_before_scaling` as the lone divergence, and C shows `F_cell=190.27` for hkl=(-7,-1,-14) while PyTorch remains at 0. Next phase focuses on understanding how C derives that amplitude (likely via generated `Fdump.bin`) before touching normalization code.
19:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-17): Attempt #77 reran Phase L3a probe on the current workstation, logged `probe_20251117.log` (F_cell=190.270004 for hkl=(-7,-1,-14)), and confirmed scaled.hkl already covers the supervisor reflection. Remaining blockers shift to wiring that data through the harness/CLI path (Phase L3c onward).
20:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-17 late): Attempt #78 completed the Phase L3c harness rerun; TRACE_PY now reports F_cell=190.27 with matching metadata, so the immediate focus moves to auditing CLI ingestion (L3c) and adding regression coverage (L3d).
21:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-18): Attempt #80 (evidence loop) closed Phase L3c — `cli_hkl_audit.md` now documents the missing `.to(device=device)` transfer at `__main__.py:1073`, confirmed probe artifacts, and queued the device fix + regression test for L3d.
22:- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-18 late): Attempt #81 implemented `.to(device=device, dtype=dtype)` and added the `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` regression (CPU/CUDA × float32/float64). Next blocker: Phase L3e scaling validation to prove all factors match C (≤1e-6) before rerunning nb-compare in Phase L4.
23:- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
24:- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
29:- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-19): Latest scaling audit (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/analysis_20251119.md`) shows `F_cell` parity restored while per-phi instrumentation (Attempt #86) now emits the expected `TRACE_PY_PHI` entries. The refreshed log exposes a residual phi=0 mismatch (`k_frac` -0.589 in PyTorch vs -0.607 in C) that flips `F_latt_b`’s sign, so Phase L3 needs a dedicated rotation-vector audit before touching normalization again.
195:Exit Criteria: Code changes merged with targeted tests covering the corrected scaling, and docs/fix_plan.md records Attempt #29 metrics before moving to Phase L.
230:### Phase L — Supervisor Command Normalization
240:| L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [D] | ✅ Attempt #54 (2025-10-17): Regenerated C cache using supervisor command flags, achieved perfect HKL parity (max |ΔF|=0.0, 0 mismatches). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/{Fdump_c_20251109.bin, summary_20251109.md, metrics_20251109.json}`. Phase L2 prerequisites now met—structure factors match C exactly. |
242:### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
244:Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.

### Phase L — Supervisor Command Normalization
Goal: Isolate and resolve the 1.26×10⁵ intensity mismatch that persists when running the full supervisor command after Phase K fixes.
Prereqs: Phase K3g artifacts refreshed (Attempt #49), nb-compare data in `phase_k/f_latt_fix/post_fix/`, instrumentation from Phase J available.
Exit Criteria: Structure-factor grids, scaling chain, and final intensities match C within thresholds (|Δh|,|Δk|,|Δl| < 5e-4; sum_ratio 0.99–1.01; mean_peak_distance ≤ 1 px); nb-compare rerun archived under `phase_l/supervisor_command/`; docs/fix_plan Attempt log updated; plan ready for archival.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1a | Run HKL ↔ Fdump parity script and capture metrics | [D] | Attempt #50 (2025-10-06) produced `summary_20251006175032.md` / `metrics_20251006175032.json`; this loop repeated the run with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin`, confirming max |ΔF|=5.22e2, 99,209 mismatched voxels, and storing `c_fdump_20251006175946.log`. Artefacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`. |
| L1b | Diagnose binary-layout mismatch between HKL and Fdump | [D] | ✅ Attempt #52 (2025-10-06) produced `scripts/validation/analyze_fdump_layout.py` plus `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/layout_analysis.md`. Confirmed nanoBragg writes `(h_range+2)×(k_range+2)×(l_range+2)` voxels via `for(h0=0; h0<=h_range; h0++)` loops (see `nanoBragg.c:2400-2486`), leaving 9,534 zero-padded entries. PyTorch reader must drop the padded plane per axis. |
| L1c | Align PyTorch HKL cache reader/writer with confirmed layout | [D] | ✅ Attempt #53 (2025-10-17): Updated `src/nanobrag_torch/io/hkl.py` to honour `(range+1)` padding, added C-code docstring quotes per Rule #11, and introduced `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` (max |ΔF| = 0.0, mismatches = 0). |
| L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [D] | ✅ Attempt #54 (2025-10-17): Regenerated C cache using supervisor command flags, achieved perfect HKL parity (max |ΔF|=0.0, 0 mismatches). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/{Fdump_c_20251109.bin, summary_20251109.md, metrics_20251109.json}`. Phase L2 prerequisites now met—structure factors match C exactly. |

### Phase L2 — Scaling Chain Audit
Goal: Capture a side-by-side breakdown of the intensity scaling pipeline (I_before_scaling → ω → polarization → r_e² → fluence → steps) for the supervisor command to isolate the first divergence that drives the 1.26×10⁵ sum ratio.
Prereqs: Phase L1d artifacts in place; Ralph working under `prompts/debug.md`; C binary instrumentable via `golden_suite_generator/` per CLAUDE Rule #0.3.
Exit Criteria: C and PyTorch traces capturing scaling factors are stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`, a comparison summary identifies the first mismatched term with quantitative deltas, and docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log references the findings.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L2a | Instrument C scaling chain | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #55: Reused existing TRACE_C hooks (nanoBragg.c 3367-3382), captured `c_trace_scaling.log` for pixel (685,1039), and recorded setup in `instrumentation_notes.md`. Artifacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/`; ready to mirror fields on the PyTorch side. |

# Rotation Vector φ=0 Drift Analysis

## Executive Summary

Phase L3f rotation-vector audit reveals component-level discrepancies in real-space vectors at φ=0 while reciprocal vectors remain highly aligned. Key finding: **Y-component drift in all three real-space vectors (0.04-6.8% deltas)** explains the k_frac offset observed in Phase L2c/L3e.

## Key Metrics

### Metric Duality (from invariant_probe.md)
- **Volume discrepancy**: +3.35e-03 Å³ (+0.000014%)
- **a·a* deviation**: -6.264e-04 (C=1.000626, Py=1.000000)
- **b·b* deviation**: +4.414e-04 (C=0.999559, Py=1.000000)
- **c·c* deviation**: +1.872e-04 (C=0.999813, Py=1.000000)

**Interpretation**: PyTorch achieves near-perfect metric duality (a·a* ≈ 1.0 within 7.5e-05) as required by crystallographic convention. C implementation shows O(1e-3) deviations from unity, suggesting accumulated numerical drift in the reciprocal-space recalculation pipeline.

**Gathering evidence on rotation axis normalization**

I’m checking whether the spindle axis is normalized by the `rotate_axis` function, so I plan to inspect `utils/geometry.py` for confirmation. For this step, I’m focusing on collecting evidence about the CLI rotation vector issue, looking through relevant architecture and specification docs—especially those mentioning crystal orientation in files like `pytorch_design.md` and other architecture docs. I’m preparing to dig into these sources to better understand how rotation vectors are handled.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Architecture Design (Addendum)

## 1.2 Differentiability vs Performance

Principle: Differentiability is required; over-hardening is not. Prefer the minimal change that passes gradcheck and preserves vectorization.

- Minimal Differentiability Contract
  - Return analytic limits at removable singularities only when the raw op produces NaN/Inf or unacceptable relative error in tests.
  - Keep the nominal fast path branch-free (or mask-based) and fully vectorized.
  - Avoid speculative guards and extra branches unless backed by (a) a reproduced gradient failure or (b) a measured numerical/perf improvement.

- Branching Budget (Hot Helpers)
  - Per-element branching inside hot helpers (e.g., `sincg`, `sinc3`, polarization) must be justified with numbers (gradcheck evidence or microbenchmark delta).

- Mask vs Guard
  - Masks gate analytic limits; a single epsilon guard may backstop tiny denominators. If the mask tolerance renders guards redundant, prefer the mask alone.

- Precision Guidance
  - Default dev dtype: float64; default prod dtype: float32. Tolerances must state dtype assumptions and be tested in both where relevant.

**Preparing detailed CLI flag instructions**

I’m piecing together what data and commands to include in new instructions for Ralph, focusing on spindle axis and volume audits in CLI-FLAGS Phase L3g. I’m considering how to specify exact fix_plan IDs and targeted pytest commands for evidence gathering, while also thinking about advising Ralph to run harness scripts or create minimal tests if none exist. I’ll verify test availability by searching for relevant rotation vector tests before finalizing the input.md tasks.

   251	| L2c | Diff traces & record first divergence | [D] | ✅ Attempt #71 refreshed `scaling_audit_summary.md` via `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`, highlighting `I_before_scaling` as the first divergence (C=9.4365e5, Py=0) while all downstream scaling factors match within 2e-3%. This establishes that the remaining gap stems from missing structure-factor coverage rather than normalization math. |

   254	Goal: Patch the PyTorch scaling pipeline so every factor (omega, polarization, capture_fraction, r_e², fluence, steps) matches the C implementation within 1e-6 relative error.
   255	Prereqs: L2 comparison summary pointing to the exact divergent factor; relevant C references documented; regression tests identified.
   256	Exit Criteria: PyTorch source changes with inline C-code docstring references are merged, targeted regression tests cover the corrected scaling semantics, and new artifacts demonstrate matching intermediate values. docs/fix_plan.md records the fix attempt and resulting metrics.

Keep the log + timestamped copies alongside a brief summary in `analysis.md`, then proceed to L3c to thread the same attachment pattern through the harness/CLI path. |
   261	| L3b | Mirror probe attachment in harness | [D] | ✅ 2025-11-17 Attempt #78: `trace_harness.py` now assigns both `hkl_data` and `hkl_metadata` before simulator construction (see `trace_py_scaling_20251117.log`, `harness_hkl_state_20251117.txt`). Keeps harness behavior aligned with probe results and removes F_cell=0 divergence. |
   262	| L3c | Audit CLI HKL loading path | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-18 Attempt #80: Refreshed `cli_hkl_audit.md` with precise line refs (line 1073) showing dtype-only transfer; confirmed probe artifacts and logged device gap blocking CUDA parity. |
   263	| L3d | Add targeted regression tests | [D] | ✅ Attempt #81 (2025-11-18): Added `TestHKLDevice::test_hkl_tensor_respects_device` covering CPU/CUDA × float32/float64; ensures HKL tensors honor requested device/dtype and lookups return F≈190.27 for (-7,-1,-14). |
   264	| L3e | Refresh per-phi scaling validation | [D] | ✅ Attempt #86 (2025-10-07 timestamp, replayed 2025-11-19 artifacts): Harness now captures 10 `TRACE_PY_PHI` lines plus JSON, reruns `compare_scaling_traces.py`, and stores outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/{per_phi,scaling_validation}/`. Remaining delta isolated to `k_frac`/`F_latt_b` at phi=0. |
   265	| L3f | Rotation-vector audit (new) | [ ] | Capture side-by-side `TRACE_C: rot_{a,b,c}` vs `TRACE_PY: rot_{a,b,c}` for phi=0 using updated harness, and dump aligned values (Angstrom + Angstrom^-1) into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md`. Highlight delta components >5e-4 and confirm whether the drift originates pre- or post-phi rotation (reference `nanoBragg.c:3006-3098`, `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors`). |
   266	| L3g | Fractional Miller alignment plan | [ ] | From the rot-vector audit, derive hypotheses for the `k_frac` offset (e.g., spindle-axis normalization, reciprocal-vector reconstitution, phi step size). Document hypotheses + confirming probes in `rot_vector/analysis.md`, then update this plan + docs/fix_plan with the chosen corrective action before any simulator edits. |
   267	| L3h | Update documentation & plans | [ ] | Once L3f/L3g evidence lands and the corrective code path is defined, refresh `docs/fix_plan.md`, architectural docs (`docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`), and this plan to capture the normalization + rotation data flow. Mark Phase L3 `[D]` after implementation + doc sync. |

When the CLI is run with `-dtype float64`, the simulator converts those float32 tensors to float64 later, permanently losing precision relative to the requested double-precision path and violating the DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 guarantee.
   442	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   443	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   444	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   445	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   446	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   447	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   448	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

   452	- Priority: High
   453	- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
   454	- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
   455	- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
   456	- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   457	  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   458	  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
   459	- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

     5	**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team
     6	
     7	## Overview
     8	
     9	This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.
    10	
    11	## Core Debugging Philosophy
    12	
    13	### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule
    14	
    15	**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
    16	1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
    17	2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
    18	3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.
    19	
    20	This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

**Structuring detailed input content**

I'll prepare a thorough `input.md` covering summary, mode, focus, branch, mapped tests, artifacts, instructions, priorities, step-by-step guidance, pitfalls, pointers, and optional next steps—all crafted clearly and concisely to guide the user through the CLI-FLAGS-003 rotation-vector drift work.
[2025-10-07T10:52:28] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Capture spindle-axis and volume evidence for the φ=0 rotation drift before touching normalization code.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / Phase L3g rotation-vector drift
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics (collect-only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md; docs/fix_plan.md attempt update (CLI-FLAGS-003)
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
If Blocked: Capture the failing harness output (stdout + stack trace) under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/blocked.log and note the blocker in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before stopping.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Direct↔reciprocal reconstruction defines V_actual usage; spindle audit must respect this contract before normalization edits.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig demands a unit spindle vector; we have to confirm PyTorch enforces the spec prior to code changes.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace workflow is mandatory; refreshed TRACE_PY output is prerequisite data.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:253 — Phase L3f/L3g tasks require quantified rot-vector deltas and hypotheses before implementation.
- docs/fix_plan.md:450 — Next Actions list the same audit; keep plan and attempt history synchronized.
How-To Map:
- Step 0: export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE; set PYTHONPATH=src before running harness scripts.
- Step 1: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
- Step 2: Refresh the PyTorch trace with spindle + volume taps:
  PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log
- Step 3: Extend the harness (or a follow-up script) to emit spindle-axis magnitude and both V_formula/V_actual; write them to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log (text) and volume_probe.md (tabulated values).
- Step 4: Diff against C trace by parsing reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log; summarise deltas and hypotheses in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md.
- Step 5: Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history (CLI-FLAGS-003) with metrics, file paths, and next probe; cross-link the refreshed plan section.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not skip KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK; simulator trace depends on it.
- Keep harness device/dtype arguments neutral—no hard-coded .cpu()/.cuda().
- Preserve existing trace files by writing into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ (no tmp paths).
- Do not edit docs/index.md or protected assets while gathering evidence.
- Avoid speculative simulator changes; stay in evidence mode until hypotheses are logged.
- Maintain vectorized operations—no new Python loops inside Crystal or Detector code.
- Capture timestamps/git SHA in new artifacts for reproducibility.
- Keep pytest usage targeted (collect-only unless a new test is authored).
- Document any divergence thresholds explicitly (<5e-4 for rot components, ≤1e-6 for volume ratios).
- Coordinate with existing plan filenames; reuse rot_vector/* assets rather than scattering new directories.
Pointers:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Reciprocal→real reconstruction / V_actual rule.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig spindle-axis definition (unit vector expectation).
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace SOP requirements.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:260 — Phase L3 checklist and deliverables.
- docs/fix_plan.md:460 — Next Actions for CLI-FLAGS-003 pending this audit.
Next Up: 1) Re-run per-φ scaling validation (Phase L3e) after hypotheses land; 2) Prep implementation plan for normalization fix once spindle/volume deltas are resolved.

**Expanding input.md for length**

I'm checking the instructions which ask for roughly 100–200 lines in input.md, but the current file is only about 30–40 lines. To meet the target length, I plan to expand the content by elaborating steps into more detailed bullet points, adding example commands, verification instructions, and extra context sections to enrich the file and bring it closer to the required length.

Summary: Capture spindle-axis magnitude and volume evidence for the φ=0 rotation drift so we can close Phase L3g without touching simulator code prematurely.

Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
If Blocked: Capture the failing harness stdout/stderr under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/blocked.log, note the exact exception + command, and record the blocker (with artifact path) in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before stopping.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Direct↔reciprocal reconstruction mandates V_actual when rebuilding real vectors; we need concrete numbers before deciding whether PyTorch or C diverged.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig treats spindle_axis as a unit vector; verifying runtime normalization prevents false hypotheses in L3g.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace SOP requires refreshed TRACE_PY data prior to any new implementation changes.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:253 — Phase L3f/L3g exit criteria demand quantified rot-vector deltas and documented hypotheses.
- docs/fix_plan.md:460 — Next Actions already call for this audit; keeping fix_plan aligned avoids duplicated supervisor loops.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md:1 — Current hypotheses reference spindle normalization and volume reuse; we must either confirm or refute them with new evidence.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 (setup): export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE; set PYTHONPATH=src; ensure A.mat and scaled.hkl remain in repo root so the harness resolves them.
- Step 1 (sanity check): pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics ; keep the output in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log.
- Step 2 (refresh trace):
  PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log
  Capture stdout with tee so the command transcript lands in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log.
- Step 3 (instrument spindle data): extend the harness (or follow-up script) to emit spindle_axis components and its norm. Write a dedicated text log:
  PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py \\
    --trace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  The log should list: raw spindle vector, computed norm, comparison vs C trace value (-1,0,0), and Δ magnitude.
- Step 4 (volume comparison): run a small analysis snippet to compute V_formula (from reciprocal vectors) and V_actual (from real vectors) for both C and Py traces; write a markdown table to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md. Include float32 + float64 runs if time permits (reuse harness with --dtype float64).
- Step 5 (fractional Miller deltas): update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md with any refreshed values (clearly mark φ=0 row). Note Δ thresholds (<5e-4) and highlight which component drives k_frac.
- Step 6 (analysis narrative): append a new dated section to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing: spindle norm parity, V_formula vs V_actual deltas, implications for k_frac, and the leading hypothesis to pursue next loop.
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync): add Attempt entry to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (norm delta, volume delta, updated hypothesis) and cross-link the new artifacts. If hypotheses change the Phase L3 guidance, update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md accordingly.
- Step 8 (optional validation): if time remains, rerun the harness with --dtype float64 and append results to the same artifacts to demonstrate dtype neutrality; note this in the Attempt entry.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Skipping KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK causes MKL crashes; set it before every harness run.
- Hard-coding .cpu()/.cuda() in probes breaks device neutrality; respect CLI device argument.
- Overwriting existing trace files without copying their previous contents will wipe historical evidence—write new logs or archive previous ones first.
- Creating new directories outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ complicates trace lineage; keep everything under that tree.
- Editing simulator or crystal code during this evidence pass is out of scope; log data only.
- Forgetting to record git SHA/timestamps in new artifacts slows future auditing; include them explicitly.
- Leaving pytest output untracked in terminal history risks loss; store collect-only logs under reports/....
- Omitting float64 validation when easy to obtain may hide dtype-specific bugs; capture at least one float64 probe if possible.
- Neglecting to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan.md leaves the project ledger stale; treat these as part of Do Now.
- Relying on anecdotal comparisons (eyeballing values) will not pass plan exit criteria; compute numeric deltas and state thresholds.
Pointers:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Reciprocal→real reconstruction + V_actual rule.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig spindle-axis expectation (unit vector contract).
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace SOP.

- Step 1 (sanity check): pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics ; keep the output in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log.
- Step 2 (refresh trace):
  PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log
  Capture stdout with tee so the command transcript lands in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log.
- Step 3 (instrument spindle data): extend the harness (or follow-up script) to emit spindle_axis components and its norm. Write a dedicated text log:
  PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py \\
    --trace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  The log should list: raw spindle vector, computed norm, comparison vs C trace value (-1,0,0), and Δ magnitude.
- Step 4 (volume comparison): run a small analysis snippet to compute V_formula (from reciprocal vectors) and V_actual (from real vectors) for both C and Py traces; write a markdown table to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md. Include float32 + float64 runs if time permits (reuse harness with --dtype float64).
- Step 5 (fractional Miller deltas): update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md with any refreshed values (clearly mark φ=0 row). Note Δ thresholds (<5e-4) and highlight which component drives k_frac.
- Step 6 (analysis narrative): append a new dated section to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing: spindle norm parity, V_formula vs V_actual deltas, implications for k_frac, and the leading hypothesis to pursue next loop.
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync): add Attempt entry to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (norm delta, volume delta, updated hypothesis) and cross-link the new artifacts. If hypotheses change the Phase L3 guidance, update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md accordingly.
- Step 8 (optional validation): if time remains, rerun the harness with --dtype float64 and append results to the same artifacts to demonstrate dtype neutrality; note this in the Attempt entry.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Skipping KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK causes MKL crashes; set it before every harness run.
- Hard-coding .cpu()/.cuda() in probes breaks device neutrality; respect CLI device argument.
- Overwriting existing trace files without copying their previous contents will wipe historical evidence—write new logs or archive previous ones first.
- Creating new directories outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ complicates trace lineage; keep everything under that tree.
- Editing simulator or crystal code during this evidence pass is out of scope; log data only.
- Forgetting to record git SHA/timestamps in new artifacts slows future auditing; include them explicitly.
- Leaving pytest output untracked in terminal history risks loss; store collect-only logs under reports/....
- Omitting float64 validation when easy to obtain may hide dtype-specific bugs; capture at least one float64 probe if possible.
- Neglecting to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan.md leaves the project ledger stale; treat these as part of Do Now.
- Relying on anecdotal comparisons (eyeballing values) will not pass plan exit criteria; compute numeric deltas and state thresholds.

Next Up: 1) Refresh per-φ scaling validation (Phase L3e artefacts) with the new spindle/volume data; 2) Once hypotheses converge, draft the code-edit strategy for normalization fixes (Phase L3h) before any implementation changes.

Summary: Capture spindle-axis magnitude and volume evidence for the φ=0 rotation drift so Phase L3g can conclude with documented hypotheses before any simulator edits.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / Phase L3g rotation-vector drift
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics (collect-only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md; docs/fix_plan.md attempt update (CLI-FLAGS-003)
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
If Blocked: Capture the failing harness stdout/stderr under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/blocked.log, note the exact exception + command, and record the blocker (with artifact path) in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before stopping.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Direct↔reciprocal reconstruction mandates V_actual; the audit must quantify PyTorch vs C usage.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig spindle_axis contract expects unit vectors, so we confirm runtime normalization before rewriting anything.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace workflow is required; refreshed TRACE_PY output is prerequisite data.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:253 — Phase L3 table lists rot-vector audit and hypothesis framing as blocking tasks.
- docs/fix_plan.md:460 — Next Actions already call for this probe; keeping ledger evidence up to date prevents redundant loops.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md:1 — Existing hypotheses (spindle norm, V reuse) need confirming evidence.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 (environment prep):
  - export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
  - export PYTHONPATH=src
  - confirm A.mat and scaled.hkl exist in repo root (ls -l A.mat scaled.hkl). Capture a quick checksum log under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256 for traceability.
- Step 1 (pytest guard):
  - pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log
  - Ensure the log shows the node was discovered; if not, fix collection before proceeding.
- Step 2 (refresh TRACE_PY):
  - PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
    | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log
  - Verify the log mentions “Captured 40 TRACE_PY lines” and that per-φ JSON refresh succeeded.
- Step 3 (spindle-axis probe):
  - Augment the harness (or create reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py) to emit: raw spindle vector, norm, delta to 1.0, and delta vs C’s (-1,0,0).
  - Run:
    PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py \\
      --trace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
      --ctrace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log \\
      --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  - Include timestamps, git SHA, dtype/device in the log header.
- Step 4 (volume analysis):
  - Write a small script or notebook-free snippet that parses both traces to compute V_formula (from reciprocal vectors) and V_actual (from real vectors); output should list absolute/relative deltas.
  - Save formatted markdown to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md with sections: Inputs, PyTorch values, C values, Δ (absolute), Δ (relative).
  - Repeat the harness run with --dtype float64 to confirm dtype neutrality; append results as a second table in the same markdown.
- Step 5 (rot-vector table refresh):
  - Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md with the latest numbers, explicitly showing Δ thresholds (<5e-4 target). Note which components exceed tolerance and link them to k_frac difference.
- Step 6 (analysis narrative):
  - Append a dated section to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing:
    * spindle norm comparison (Py vs C)
    * V_formula vs V_actual findings (float32 + float64)
    * updated hypothesis for k_frac drift (e.g., residual rounding in C volume regeneration or PyTorch not re-using C’s unitize semantics)
    * next diagnostic you would run if time allowed (e.g., logging a0/ap before phi rotation)
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync):
  - Add an Attempt entry under CLI-FLAGS-003 in docs/fix_plan.md capturing metrics, artifacts, and refined hypothesis.
  - If the hypothesis changes the to-do list (e.g., need spindle normalization change), update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md so L3f/L3g text reflects the new evidence.
- Step 8 (optional cross-check):
  - If bandwidth permits, rerun the harness on CUDA (device=cuda) to confirm the same deltas apply; note the result in spindle_audit.log and the fix_plan attempt.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Forgetting to export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK causes MKL errors—set it before every harness run.
- Hard-coding .cpu()/.cuda() in probes breaks device neutrality; keep probes parameterized.
- Overwriting existing trace files without preserving older copies will destroy historic evidence; archive or rename first.
- Writing artifacts outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ fragments audit history; stay within that directory tree.
- Editing simulator/crystal code during this evidence pass is off-limits; gather data only.
- Skipping timestamps/git SHA in new artifacts impairs reproducibility; include them explicitly.
- Ignoring float64 probes risks missing dtype regressions; capture at least one double-precision run if possible.
- Leaving pytest output in the terminal history risks loss; tee logs into the reports directory.
- Failing to document thresholds (≤5e-4, ≤1e-6) makes later comparisons ambiguous; write them down with the numbers.
- Neglecting to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan.md after collecting evidence leaves the ledger stale.
- Using relative paths without PYTHONPATH=src may import stale code; set the env var first.
- Assuming A.mat/scaled.hkl integrity without checksums can mislead if files change; record sha256 hashes upfront.

How-To Map:
- Step 0 (environment prep):
  - export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
  - export PYTHONPATH=src
  - ls -l A.mat scaled.hkl
  - sha256sum A.mat scaled.hkl > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256
  - record git rev-parse HEAD >> the same file for provenance.
- Step 1 (pytest guard):
  - pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log
  - confirm the output includes the test node; if not, repair collection before proceeding.
- Step 2 (refresh TRACE_PY):
  - PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
    | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log
  - verify the run log mentions “Captured 40 TRACE_PY lines” and per-φ outputs were written.
- Step 3 (spindle-axis probe):
  - Implement reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py (or extend the harness) to parse TRACE_PY and TRACE_C spindle data.
  - Command:
    PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py \\
      --trace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\

      --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  - Include: raw vectors, norms, Δ(norm), Δ(component), and a pass/fail flag against tolerance 5e-4.
- Step 4 (volume analysis):
  - Write a python snippet (can live inside spindle_probe or standalone) to compute V_formula from reciprocal vectors and V_actual from real vectors for both traces.
  - Save results into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md with sections: Inputs, PyTorch float32, PyTorch float64, C reference, delta table.
  - Run the harness a second time with --dtype float64 and append the float64 measurements.
- Step 5 (rot-vector table refresh):
  - Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md using the new float32/float64 values; highlight components exceeding tolerance with explicit Δ numbers.
  - Note which component explains the k_frac shift (currently PyTorch b_y drift).
- Step 6 (analysis narrative):
  - Append a dated paragraph to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing spindle norm parity, volume findings, dtype check, and the updated leading hypothesis.
  - Document the single next probe you’d run if more time were available (e.g., log ap/bp before mosaic rotation).
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync):
  - Add an Attempt entry to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 capturing metrics, artifacts, and hypothesis outcome.
  - If Phase L3 description needs refinement (e.g., new task for spindle normalization), update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md lines 265-267 accordingly.
- Step 8 (optional cross-check):
  - If CUDA is available, repeat Step 2 with --device cuda --dtype float32; append CUDA results to spindle_audit.log and mention them in the fix_plan attempt.
  - If CUDA fails, note the failure (with log path) in the attempt entry.
- Step 9 (cleanup):
  - Ensure new files live under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/; avoid temporary directories.
  - Run git status to confirm only intended files changed.
  - Leave implementation untouched; only scripts/docs/reports should differ.
- Step 10 (documentation proof):
  - Cross-reference new artifacts in docs/fix_plan.md (bullet list of paths).
  - Mention thresholds used (norm tolerance 5e-4, volume tolerance 1e-6) so future loops understand pass/fail criteria.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Forgetting to export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK causes MKL failures—set it before every harness run.
- Hard-coding .cpu()/.cuda() in probes breaks device neutrality; keep probes parameterized.
- Overwriting trace files without keeping older copies will erase prior evidence; archive or rename first.
- Writing artifacts outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ fragments audit history; stay within that directory tree.
- Editing simulator/crystal code during this evidence pass is off-limits; gather data only.
- Skipping timestamps and git SHA in new artifacts impairs reproducibility; include them explicitly.
- Ignoring float64 probes risks missing dtype regressions; capture at least one double-precision run if possible.
- Leaving pytest output in the terminal history risks loss; tee logs into the reports directory.
- Failing to document tolerance thresholds makes later comparisons ambiguous; write them next to the numbers.
- Neglecting to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan.md after collecting evidence leaves the ledger stale.
- Using relative imports without PYTHONPATH=src may import stale modules; set the env var first.
- Assuming A.mat/scaled.hkl integrity without checksums can mislead if files change; record sha256 upfront.
- Forgetting to note device/dtype in spindle_audit.log reduces its value; print both explicitly.
- Removing existing analysis context from analysis.md instead of appending will lose historical rationale.

Summary: Capture spindle-axis magnitude and volume evidence for the φ=0 rotation drift so Phase L3g can conclude with documented hypotheses before any simulator edits.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 / Phase L3g rotation-vector drift
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics (collect-only)
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md; docs/fix_plan.md attempt update (CLI-FLAGS-003)
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics
If Blocked: Capture the failing harness stdout/stderr under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/blocked.log, note the exact exception + command, and record the blocker (with artifact path) in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before stopping.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Direct↔reciprocal reconstruction mandates V_actual; the audit must quantify PyTorch vs C usage before touching the implementation.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig spindle_axis contract expects unit vectors, so we confirm runtime normalization for CLI inputs (especially -spindle_axis -1 0 0).
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace workflow is required; fresh TRACE_PY data is prerequisite to any fix.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:184 — Motion pipeline description highlights phi rotation order; spindle audit needs to respect this sequence.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:253 — Phase L3 table lists rot-vector audit and hypothesis framing as blocking tasks.
- docs/fix_plan.md:460 — Next Actions already call for this probe; keeping ledger evidence up to date prevents redundant loops.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md:1 — Existing hypotheses (spindle norm, V reuse) require confirming evidence.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 (environment prep):
  - export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
  - export PYTHONPATH=src
  - ls -l A.mat scaled.hkl
  - sha256sum A.mat scaled.hkl > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256
  - record git rev-parse HEAD >> the same file for provenance.
- Step 1 (pytest guard):
  - pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log
  - confirm the output includes the test node; if not, repair collection before proceeding.
- Step 2 (refresh TRACE_PY):
  - PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
    | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log
  - verify the run log mentions “Captured 40 TRACE_PY lines” and per-φ outputs were written.
- Step 3 (spindle-axis probe):
  - Implement reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py (or extend the harness) to parse TRACE_PY and TRACE_C spindle data.
  - Command:
    PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py \\
      --trace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
      --ctrace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log \\
      --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  - Include: raw vectors, norms, Δ(norm), Δ(component), and a pass/fail flag against tolerance 5e-4.
- Step 4 (volume analysis):
  - Write a python snippet (can live inside spindle_probe or standalone) to compute V_formula from reciprocal vectors and V_actual from real vectors for both traces.
  - Save results into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md with sections: Inputs, PyTorch float32, PyTorch float64, C reference, delta table.
  - Run the harness a second time with --dtype float64 and append the float64 measurements.
- Step 5 (rot-vector table refresh):
  - Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md using the new float32/float64 values; highlight components exceeding tolerance with explicit Δ numbers.
  - Note which component explains the k_frac shift (currently PyTorch b_y drift).
- Step 6 (analysis narrative):
  - Append a dated paragraph to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing spindle norm parity, volume findings, dtype check, and the updated leading hypothesis.
  - Document the single next probe you’d run if more time were available (e.g., log ap/bp before mosaic rotation).
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync):
  - Add an Attempt entry to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 capturing metrics, artifacts, and hypothesis outcome.
  - If Phase L3 description needs refinement (e.g., new task for spindle normalization), update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md lines 265-267 accordingly.
- Step 8 (optional cross-check):
  - If CUDA is available, repeat Step 2 with --device cuda --dtype float32; append CUDA results to spindle_audit.log and mention them in the fix_plan attempt.

  - Log raw vectors, norms, Δ(norm), Δ(component), device/dtype, and tolerance verdict (≤5e-4).
- Step 4 (volume analysis):
  - Write a python snippet to compute V_formula (reciprocal cross product) and V_actual (real vectors dot triple) for both traces.
  - Save results into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md with sections: Inputs, PyTorch float32, PyTorch float64, C reference, delta table.
  - Run the harness again with --dtype float64 to populate the float64 section.

  - Mention per-component Δ and relative errors.
- Step 6 (analysis narrative):
  - Append a dated section to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing spindle norms, volume deltas, dtype comparisons, and updated hypothesis.
  - Include a “Next diagnostic” bullet (e.g., log ap/bp before mosaic) to guide the following loop.

  - If CUDA is unavailable or fails, log the reason in blocked.log and fix_plan attempt.
- Step 9 (per-φ verification):
  - Ensure the per-φ JSON under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/ includes k_frac entries; reference it in analysis.md to show φ dependence (or lack thereof).
- Step 10 (cleanup):
  - Keep new files under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/; avoid temporary directories.
  - Run git status to confirm only intended files changed; no simulator sources touched.
- Step 11 (documentation proof):
  - Cross-reference new artifacts in docs/fix_plan.md (list paths in the attempt entry).
  - State tolerance thresholds (norm ≤5e-4, volume ≤1e-6) so future comparisons are deterministic.

  - Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md with the refreshed values; highlight components exceeding tolerance and tie them to k_frac.
  - Mention per-component Δ and relative errors.
- Step 6 (analysis narrative):
  - Append a dated section to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing spindle norms, volume deltas, dtype comparisons, and updated hypothesis.
  - Include a “Next diagnostic” bullet (e.g., log ap/bp before mosaic) to guide the following loop.
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync):
  - Add an Attempt entry to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 capturing metrics, artifacts, thresholds, and hypothesis outcome.
  - If Phase L3 text needs refinement (e.g., new spindle normalization task), update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md lines 265-267 accordingly.
- Step 8 (optional cross-check):
  - If CUDA is available, repeat Step 2 with --device cuda --dtype float32; append the results to spindle_audit.log and document them in fix_plan.
  - If CUDA is unavailable or fails, log the reason in blocked.log and fix_plan attempt.
- Step 9 (per-φ verification):
  - Ensure the per-φ JSON under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/ includes k_frac entries; reference it in analysis.md to show φ dependence (or lack thereof).
- Step 10 (cleanup):
  - Keep new files under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/; avoid temporary directories.
  - Run git status to confirm only intended files changed; no simulator sources touched.
- Step 11 (documentation proof):
  - Cross-reference new artifacts in docs/fix_plan.md (list paths in the attempt entry).
  - State tolerance thresholds (norm ≤5e-4, volume ≤1e-6) so future comparisons are deterministic.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Forgetting to export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK causes MKL failures; set it before every harness run.
- Hard-coding .cpu()/.cuda() in probes breaks device neutrality; keep probes parameterized.
- Overwriting trace files without preserving older copies will erase evidence; archive first.
- Writing artifacts outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ fragments audit history; stay within that directory tree.
- Editing simulator/crystal code during this evidence pass is off-limits; gather data only.
- Skipping timestamps and git SHA in new artifacts impairs reproducibility; include them explicitly.
- Ignoring float64 probes risks missing dtype regressions; capture at least one double-precision run if possible.
- Leaving pytest output in the terminal history risks loss; tee logs into the reports directory.
- Failing to document tolerance thresholds makes later comparisons ambiguous; write them next to the numbers.
- Neglecting to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan.md leaves the ledger stale after evidence capture.
- Using relative imports without PYTHONPATH=src may import stale modules; set the env var first.
- Assuming A.mat/scaled.hkl integrity without checksums can mislead if files change; record sha256 upfront.
- Forgetting to note device/dtype in spindle_audit.log reduces its diagnostic value; print both explicitly.
- Removing existing analysis context instead of appending will lose historical rationale; always append.
- Failing to mention per-φ findings in analysis.md leaves Phase L3e context unclear; reference the JSON explicitly.

Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:120 — Direct↔reciprocal reconstruction mandates V_actual; the audit must quantify PyTorch vs C usage before touching the implementation.
- arch.md:170 — CrystalConfig spindle_axis contract expects unit vectors, so we confirm runtime normalization for CLI inputs (especially -spindle_axis -1 0 0).
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:15 — Parallel trace workflow is required; fresh TRACE_PY data is prerequisite to any fix.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:184 — Rotation pipeline details guide which tensors to log (phi→mosaic order).
- docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md:310 — Highlights where C re-normalizes spindle vectors; use it to cross-check harness outputs.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:253 — Phase L3 checklist lists rot-vector audit and hypothesis framing as blocking tasks.
- docs/fix_plan.md:460 — Next Actions already call for this probe; keeping ledger evidence up to date prevents redundant loops.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md:1 — Existing hypotheses (spindle norm, V reuse) require confirming evidence.
How-To Map:
- Step 0 (environment prep):
  - export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
  - export PYTHONPATH=src
  - ls -l A.mat scaled.hkl
  - sha256sum A.mat scaled.hkl > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256

  - date -Iseconds >> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256
- Step 1 (pytest guard):
  - pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log
  - confirm the log shows the node and exit code 0; otherwise repair collection first.
- Step 2 (refresh TRACE_PY):
  - PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\

    | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log
  - verify the run mentions “Captured 40 TRACE_PY lines” and that per-φ JSON was written; if missing, fix harness instrumentation.
- Step 3 (spindle-axis probe):
  - Implement reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py (or extend harness) to parse TRACE_PY and TRACE_C spindle lines.
  - Command:

      --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  - Log raw vectors, norms, Δ(norm), Δ(component), device/dtype, and tolerance verdict (≤5e-4).
- Step 4 (volume analysis):
  - Write a python snippet to compute V_formula (reciprocal cross product) and V_actual (real vectors triple product) for both traces.
  - Save results into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md with sections: Inputs, PyTorch float32, PyTorch float64, C reference, delta table.
  - Run the harness again with --dtype float64 to populate the float64 section.

  - Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md with the refreshed values; highlight components exceeding tolerance and tie them to k_frac.
  - Mention per-component Δ and relative error percentages for clarity.

How-To Map:
- Step 0 (environment prep):
  - export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
  - export PYTHONPATH=src
  - ls -l A.mat scaled.hkl
  - sha256sum A.mat scaled.hkl > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256
  - git rev-parse HEAD >> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256
  - date -Iseconds >> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/input_files.sha256
- Step 1 (pytest guard):
  - pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_trace_pixel.py::TestScalingTrace::test_scaling_trace_matches_physics | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/test_collect.log
  - confirm the log shows the node and exit code 0; otherwise repair collection first.
- Step 2 (refresh TRACE_PY):
  - PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py \\
    --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 \\
    --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
    | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_run.log
  - verify the run mentions “Captured 40 TRACE_PY lines” and that per-φ JSON was written; if missing, fix harness instrumentation.
- Step 3 (spindle-axis probe):
  - Implement reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py (or extend harness) to parse TRACE_PY and TRACE_C spindle lines.
  - Command:
    PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_probe.py \\
      --trace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log \\
      --ctrace reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log \\
      --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/spindle_audit.log
  - Log raw vectors, norms, Δ(norm), Δ(component), device/dtype, and tolerance verdict (≤5e-4).
- Step 4 (volume analysis):
  - Write a python snippet to compute V_formula (reciprocal cross product) and V_actual (real vectors triple product) for both traces.
  - Save results into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/volume_probe.md with sections: Inputs, PyTorch float32, PyTorch float64, C reference, delta table.
  - Run the harness again with --dtype float64 to populate the float64 section.
- Step 5 (rot-vector table refresh):
  - Update reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md with the refreshed values; highlight components exceeding tolerance and tie them to k_frac.
  - Mention per-component Δ and relative error percentages for clarity.
- Step 6 (analysis narrative):
  - Append a dated section to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/analysis.md summarizing spindle norms, volume deltas, dtype comparisons, and updated hypothesis.
  - Include a “Next diagnostic” bullet (e.g., log ap/bp before mosaic) to guide the following loop.
- Step 7 (plan + ledger sync):
  - Add an Attempt entry to docs/fix_plan.md under CLI-FLAGS-003 capturing metrics, artifacts, thresholds, and hypothesis outcome.
  - If Phase L3 text needs refinement (e.g., new spindle normalization task), update plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md lines 265-267 accordingly.
- Step 8 (optional cross-check):
  - If CUDA is available, repeat Step 2 with --device cuda --dtype float32; append the results to spindle_audit.log and document them in fix_plan.
  - If CUDA is unavailable or fails, log the reason in blocked.log and fix_plan attempt.
- Step 9 (per-φ verification):
  - Ensure the per-φ JSON under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/ includes k_frac entries; reference it in analysis.md to show φ dependence (or lack thereof).
- Step 10 (cleanup):
  - Keep new files under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/; avoid temporary directories.
  - Run git status to confirm only intended files changed; no simulator sources touched.
- Step 11 (documentation proof):
  - Cross-reference new artifacts in docs/fix_plan.md (list paths in the attempt entry).
  - State tolerance thresholds (norm ≤5e-4, volume ≤1e-6) so future comparisons are deterministic.
  - Mention any dtype/device coverage in the attempt summary.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Forgetting to export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK causes MKL failures; set it before every harness run.
- Hard-coding .cpu()/.cuda() in probes breaks device neutrality; keep probes parameterized.
- Overwriting trace files without preserving older copies will erase evidence; archive first.
- Writing artifacts outside reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/ fragments audit history; stay within that directory tree.
- Editing simulator/crystal code during this evidence pass is off-limits; gather data only.
- Skipping timestamps and git SHA in new artifacts impairs reproducibility; include them explicitly.
- Ignoring float64 probes risks missing dtype regressions; capture at least one double-precision run if possible.
- Leaving pytest output in the terminal history risks loss; tee logs into the reports directory.
- Failing to document tolerance thresholds makes later comparisons ambiguous; write them next to the numbers.
- Neglecting to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan.md leaves the ledger stale after evidence capture.
- Using relative imports without PYTHONPATH=src may import stale modules; set the env var first.
- Assuming A.mat/scaled.hkl integrity without checksums can mislead if files change; record sha256 upfront.
- Forgetting to note device/dtype in spindle_audit.log reduces its diagnostic value; print both explicitly.
- Removing existing analysis context instead of appending will lose historical rationale; always append.
- Failing to mention per-φ findings in analysis.md leaves Phase L3e context unclear; reference the JSON explicitly.
- Skipping CUDA note when unavailable can waste future time; document availability status.

**Preparing final detailed summary**

I’m organizing a clear, concise message highlighting key actions like specifying new instructions in `input.md`, updating `galph_memory.md`, and focusing on Parity Mode tasks. I’ll include references to important docs with line numbers and outline main findings and next steps for Ralph, all while following the user’s guidelines for structure and content.
[2025-10-07T10:56:36] codex

**Actions**
- Shifted supervisor focus to CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3g after reviewing outstanding tasks and trace artifacts (`docs/fix_plan.md:460`, `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:265`).
- Re-read the reciprocity contract and spindle expectations to ground the audit scope (`specs/spec-a-core.md:120`, `arch.md:170`, `docs/debugging/debugging.md:15`).
- Logged the handoff in `input.md` with 100-line Parity guidance covering pytest collect-only, refreshed TRACE_PY capture, spindle/volume probes, and ledger updates.
- Appended galph supervisor memory with the new evidence plan (`galph_memory.md` tail).

**Direction for Ralph**
- Follow `input.md` (Parity mode, focus on CLI-FLAGS-003 / Phase L3g) to rerun the trace harness, build `spindle_probe.py`, capture spindle norms and V_formula/V_actual comparisons under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/`, and record results in `docs/fix_plan.md`.
- Keep work evidence-only until those artifacts confirm or refute the current Y-component drift hypothesis.
