review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, Do Now SHALL be evidence‑only: run the authoritative reference reproduction commands and capture the required artifacts; at most run the project’s test discovery (no execution). Do not include runnable tests.

Validation Preflight (tests): Before listing any test file/identifier in Do Now, validate that it resolves via the project’s documented test discovery; if validation fails, omit tests and note “(none — evidence‑only this loop)” and add a TODO in docs/fix_plan.md documenting the missing mapping.

Human Summary (input.md header): Prepend a short summary block with the following lines (validated where applicable):
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>

Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it relate to? 
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? if not, fix. things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, this should be addressed. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
- Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
- Header: timestamp, current commit hash (short), author “galph”, and Active Focus summary.
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it. If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

### Crystal Parameters

|------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| `-cell a b c al be ga` | `CrystalConfig.cell_a/b/c/alpha/beta/gamma` | `a[0], b[0], c[0], alpha, beta, gamma` | Å and degrees → radians | Must convert degrees to radians internally |
| `-N <val>` | `CrystalConfig.N_cells` | `Na, Nb, Nc` | Number of unit cells | Sets all three axes to same value |

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-17 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the full CUSTOM pix0 transform, with validation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f*/`. The parity rerun (F3) remains outstanding. Traces now confirm MOSFLM orientation parity, but `hkl_frac` and lattice structure factor terms still diverge (PyTorch `F_latt≈6.3e1` vs C `3.6e4`). We must align the scattering/lattice pipeline (new Phase H) before tackling polarization (Phase I) where C’s Kahn factor ≈0.913 vs PyTorch 1.0.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Current harness injects the custom beam vector manually; CLI parity requires native wiring.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A/B/C2/D3/E/F1/F2/G1/G2/G3 ✅; Phase F3 parity rerun + Phases H–I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: (1) Execute Phase H3b by applying the BEAM-pivot pix0 transformation when `pix0_override_m` is provided (match nanoBragg.c lines 1833-1835), ensuring differentiability/device neutrality and capturing implementation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`; (2) Add a targeted regression test exercising CUSTOM `-pix0_vector_mm` to prove the transformed pix0 matches the C formula (store pytest log alongside the implementation artifacts); (3) Update `phase_h/implementation_notes.md` with fix details and append Attempt #22 in the plan log; (4) After the fix lands, proceed to Phase H4 parity smoke (polarization disabled) and, once lattice parity is confirmed, continue to Phase I polarization alignment and repository cleanup (e.g., removing `scaled.hkl.1`).
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-05] Phase A Complete — Tasks A1-A3 executed per plan.
    Metrics: C reference behavior captured for both flags via parallel command execution.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_nonoise.log` - C run WITH -nonoise
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_noise.log` - C run WITHOUT -nonoise

5:- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-17 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the full CUSTOM pix0 transform, with validation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f*/`. The parity rerun (F3) remains outstanding. Traces now confirm MOSFLM orientation parity, but `hkl_frac` and lattice structure factor terms still diverge (PyTorch `F_latt≈6.3e1` vs C `3.6e4`). We must align the scattering/lattice pipeline (new Phase H) before tackling polarization (Phase I) where C’s Kahn factor ≈0.913 vs PyTorch 1.0.
89:| G3 | Trace verification + parity rerun | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #18 (ralph). Fixed MOSFLM matrix transpose bug (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/mosflm.py:88`). Reciprocal vectors now match C exactly (9/9 components to 16 decimals). Miller indices match: (2,2,-13). F_cell perfect match: 300.58. Real vectors within 0.05Å (<0.2% error). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation_fixed.md`, `traces/trace_c.log`, `traces/trace_py_fixed.log`. Intensity parity still divergent (deferred to Phase H polarization). |

### Phase H — Lattice Structure Factor Alignment
Goal: Ensure the CLI-provided beam vector propagates through Detector→Simulator and bring scattering/lattice parity back in line before polarization work.
Prereqs: Phases F and G complete; orientation traces captured (Phase G3 artifacts in place).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison shows `pix0_vector` components matching C within 5e-5 m, `h`, `k`, `l` fractional components within 1e-3, `F_latt_a/b/c` within 0.5% (signed), and a parity rerun demonstrates ≥0.95 correlation improvement attributable to lattice fixes (polarization still disabled).

Pending: rerun `phase_h/trace_harness.py` to confirm `incident_vec` parity before Phase H3. |
| H3a | Diagnose residual lattice mismatch | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #21 (ralph). `trace_py_after_H3_refresh.log`, `pix0_reproduction.md`, and `implementation_notes.md` quantify the ~1.14 mm pix0 delta and show the cascade into scattering vector and `F_latt` disparities; `attempt_log.txt` restored with evidence summary. |
| H3b | Implement BEAM-pivot transform for pix0 overrides | [ ] | Apply the C-style formula `pix0 = -Fbeam·fdet - Sbeam·sdet + distance_corrected·beam` even when `pix0_override_m` is provided so CUSTOM overrides obey the BEAM pivot. Guard differentiability/device neutrality, add a targeted regression test under `tests/test_cli_flags.py`, and document the change in `phase_h/implementation_notes.md`. Capture code diff + pytest log under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`. |
| H4 | Validate lattice parity | [ ] | Once H3b lands, rerun the supervisor command with polarization disabled; capture aligned traces, `F_latt` comparisons (<0.5% delta), and intensity ratios (<10×) under `phase_h/parity_after_lattice_fix/`. Update docs/fix_plan Attempt log with metrics and attach any targeted pytest node you leverage. |

### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

**Preparing for implementation analysis**

I'm focusing on planning Phase H3b, which involves implementation, but I must refrain from making code changes myself. Instead, I'll analyze the existing codebase closely—especially around the pix0 transform in `detector.py`—to understand what needs to be done and prepare clear instructions for the subordinate to follow.

**Outlining multi-step plan for analysis and updates**

I’m organizing a detailed plan to analyze code and documentation, run a coin flip script to guide next steps, review commit history if needed, update planning files, draft an input memo, and manage git operations—balancing thoroughness with the instructions about when to use planning tools.

**Updating plan with deep analysis**

I’m working on articulating a detailed analysis focused on the CLI parity command requiring -nonoise and -pix0 flags. I plan to check the current implementation phase (H3b), investigate why `pix0_override_m` isn’t used, inspect relevant CLI parsing logic likely in `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py`, and note any leftover files like `detector.py.backup` that might affect things. This will help clarify missing functionality and issues before the next step.

**Analyzing pix0 override handling and beam parameter calculations**

I'm working through how the pix0 override should influence beam center and vector updates, realizing the C code likely recalculates beam parameters from the override vector to keep the detector positioning consistent. I’m considering computing Fbeam and Sbeam directly from the override and verifying whether beam centers should be reset accordingly to preserve the formula behavior, while also planning to review related docs and existing plans to ensure a thorough understanding before moving forward.

- Authored new 106-line input.md directing Ralph to clone the trace harness, remove manual beam override, capture fresh PyTorch traces/diffs, and log findings (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/*). Added reporting checklist + reference metrics.
- Follow-ups for Ralph next loop: execute Phase H1 evidence capture, then tackle Phase H2 sincg/NaNbNc diagnosis, defer polarization (Phase I) and `scaled.hkl.1` cleanup until lattice parity improves.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop)
- Coin flip=heads → reviewed Ralph commits d150858, b73f0e2; work productive (Phase H1 evidence, Phase G3 orientation fix).
- Updated plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase H goal + tasks (H1 marked done; new H2 beam propagation, H3 lattice, H4 parity).
- docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions now call out H2–H4 sequence; reinforced beam-vector fix as first deliverable.
- Authored new input.md (Do Now: Phase H2 beam propagation + targeted pytest) and committed with message "SUPERVISOR: CLI H2 plan refresh - tests: not run".
- Working tree clean post-push (feature/spec-based-2 @ 35cd319).
 - Follow-up: Ralph to wire detector.beam_vector into Simulator, rerun beam trace, and land targeted pytest per input.md.
## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3 evidence prep)
- git sync clean (ba649f0). Reviewed required specs/arch/testing docs plus plans/active entries before analysis per SOP.
- Long-term Goal 1 status: beam vector fix merged (commit 8c1583d) but Phase H3 evidence missing—PyTorch trace still shows pre-fix divergence. Key gaps: rerun `trace_harness.py` without manual overrides, diff against `trace_c.log`, log first divergence; likely causes for residual lattice mismatch are either incorrect `sincg` argument (`π*(h-h0)` vs `π*h`) or Na/Nb/Nc scaling once incident vector confirmed. Goal 2 (vectorization) remains blocked until CLI parity evidence complete; Phase A baseline still outstanding.
- Coin flip → heads; reviewed last ~10 Ralph iterations. Latest commit 8c1583d correctly delegates `detector.beam_vector` into Simulator, adds regression test (`TestCLIBeamVector::test_custom_beam_vector_propagates`), no regressions observed. Work productive; advised to capture post-fix trace before touching lattice math.
- Plan upkeep: marked `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H2 as [D] with Attempt #20 context and refreshed H3 guidance to require new trace evidence + hypothesis logging. Input memo rewritten (108 lines) directing Ralph to produce `trace_py_after_H2` artifacts, diff vs C, update reports/implementation notes, and run targeted pytest.
- Follow-ups for Ralph next loop: run trace harness with env vars, store `trace_py_after_H2` + diff + comparison markdown, update docs/fix_plan Attempt log with findings, keep loop evidence-only (no code edits) before advancing to lattice fixes.

## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H3 sincg diagnosis setup)
- Git already up to date (15fdec5); mandatory spec/arch/testing docs and active plans refreshed before analysis.
- Long-term Goal 1: New Phase H3 evidence (commit ce28187) shows `F_latt` mismatch; confirmed top hypothesis is PyTorch feeding `(h-h0)` into `sincg`. Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` H3 guidance to require manual `sincg(M_PI*h, Na)` reproduction and hypothesis logging before any simulator edits.

**Analyzing pix0_override usage and beam pivot computation**

I'm digging into how the pix0_override vector should affect beam pivot calculations, noticing gaps where the stored override isn't used in formulas. I'm sketching how to incorporate override values into Fbeam, Sbeam, and close distance calculations, while checking how this aligns with MOSFLM offsets and the CUSTOM beam convention flag. I'll also look into where detector convention is set, probably in CLI argument parsing.

   440	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   441	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   442	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   443	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   444	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   445	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   446	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

     2	
     3	**Version:** 1.1

     7	## 1. Introduction & Philosophy
     8	
     9	This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
    10	Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:
    11	
    12	1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
    13	2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
    14	3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.
    15	
    16	All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.
    17	
    18	### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline
    19	
    20	- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

**Designing detailed input memo structure**

I'm planning a comprehensive input memo covering sections like Do Now with exact commands and environment variables, fallback actions if blocked, priorities with doc references, step-by-step how-to commands including test instructions, pitfalls to avoid, and precise pointers to docs with line numbers. I'll carefully format headers, spacing, and content to produce about 120 lines reflecting a cohesive, actionable plan.

commit: 2113548
author: galph
Active Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H3b — enforce BEAM-pivot pix0 override parity

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase H3b) — run "'`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v`

If Blocked: Capture fresh C & PyTorch traces via `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py`, log first divergence, and append a note plus artifact paths to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/blocked.md` before exiting the loop.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Next Actions spell out the projection math and artifact requirements for H3b; follow them verbatim to unblock parity.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:101 — Guidance details the exact projections/back-conversions needed before recomputing pix0, plus the regression + artifact expectations.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35 — Confirms the BEAM-pivot formula (`-Fbeam·fdet - Sbeam·sdet + distance·beam`) we must reuse after deriving override-aware offsets.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:53 — Reminds us how beam centers map across conventions so header fields stay aligned once we recompute `beam_center_f/s`.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:18 — Device/dtype guardrails apply; updated detector math must stay neutral and get exercised through targeted pytest before any broad sweep.

How-To Map:
1. Export env: `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` and `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for the whole loop.
2. Pull the reference pix0 from Phase A: `grep DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt` and convert it into JSON (meters) saved as `pix0_expected.json` in the same directory.
3. Update `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`:
   - In `_calculate_pix0_vector`, detect `pix0_override_m` when pivot=BEAM, compute `beam_term = self.distance_corrected * beam_vector`, then project `pix0_override - beam_term` onto `fdet_vec` and `sdet_vec` to obtain `Fbeam_override`/`Sbeam_override` tensors (keep gradients, no `.item()`).
   - Convert those offsets back into pixel-space beam centres (`beam_center_*_pixels = override / self.pixel_size`) and update `self.beam_center_f`/`self.beam_center_s` tensors to maintain header parity.
   - Reuse the standard BEAM formula to write `self.pix0_vector`, refresh `self.close_distance`, and ensure caches/r_factor logic stay untouched.
4. Add the regression in `tests/test_cli_flags.py` under a new class `TestCLIPix0Override`:
   - Use the supervisor command parameters (restricted ROI) via CLI helpers to run with `-pix0_vector_mm`.
   - Assert detector.pix0_vector matches the expected JSON (within 5e-5 m) and that beam centres reported by the CLI map back to the override projections.
5. Capture implementation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`:
   - `pix0_expected.json`
   - `pytest_TestCLIPix0Override.log` via `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest ... | tee ...`
   - `implementation_notes.md` summarising math, tensors, and any differentiability checks.
6. Run the targeted test: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v` (CPU). If CUDA is available, immediately rerun with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` to prove device neutrality and append both logs.
7. Update `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempts with Attempt #22 (implementation), referencing artifacts and pytest results, before moving toward H4 in a later loop.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not bypass the projection math by directly assigning the override; C parity hinges on recomputing via fdet/sdet basis.
- No `.item()`, `.cpu()`, or python floats when touching tensors that participate in gradients.
- Keep cache invalidation intact—updating beam centres/pix0 must retain dtype/device of existing tensors.
- Do not delete or rename assets listed in `docs/index.md`; only add new artifacts under the specified reports directory.
- Avoid editing `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py.backup`; the authoritative file is `detector.py`.
- Do not run the full pytest suite this loop; stick to the targeted node(s) above unless code changes force broader coverage later.
- Ensure the CLI regression operates through the public entry point (no private helper shortcuts) to keep parity honest.
- Capture artifacts before leaving the loop; missing evidence will block plan closure.
- Preserve CUSTOM convention side effects—setting pix0 must not reset beam/spindle/polar vectors.
- Keep git history clean; no WIP commits with failing tests.

Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:91
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:53
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:18
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log

Next Up:
- Phase H4 parity smoke once H3b regression passes, then resume Phase I polarization work as queued in the plan.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

+- Next Actions: (1) Execute Phase H3b by projecting any `pix0_override_m` through the detector basis before recomputing pix0 (subtract the beam term, compute `Fbeam_override = -⟨pix0_override - distance_corrected·beam, fdet⟩` and `Sbeam_override = -⟨…, sdet⟩`, update `beam_center_f/s` tensors accordingly, then reuse the BEAM formula) while preserving differentiability/device neutrality; (2) Capture the expected C pix0 vector in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json`, add a targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_flags.py` that drives the CLI with `-pix0_vector_mm` and asserts the transformed pix0 and beam-centre headers match the trace, and store the pytest log under the same directory; (3) Update `phase_h/implementation_notes.md` with fix details and append Attempt #22 in the plan log; (4) After the fix lands, proceed to Phase H4 parity smoke (polarization disabled) and, once lattice parity is confirmed, continue to Phase I polarization alignment and repository cleanup (e.g., removing `scaled.hkl.1`).

Active Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H3b — enforce BEAM-pivot pix0 override parity

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase H3b) — run "'`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v`

If Blocked: Capture fresh C & PyTorch traces via `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py`, stash outputs plus first-divergence notes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/blocked.md`, and push an Attempts log entry so we have evidence for the next supervisor loop.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Next Actions spell out the projection math, regression test, and artifact paths that must land before Phase H4; deviations risk prolonging the parity block.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:101 — H3b guidance mandates subtracting the beam term before projecting the override and asks for beam-centre tensor updates; follow exactly to mirror nanoBragg.c lines 1833–1846.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35 — Reiterates the canonical BEAM formula and the dependence on Fbeam/Sbeam; our override handling must funnel through this path to stay spec-compliant.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:53 — Enumerates how CLI beam centres map into DetectorConfig across conventions; we must maintain these invariants when we rewrite beam centre tensors from the override-derived offsets.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:18 — Device/dtype neutrality and targeted test expectations; any new regression must exercise CPU (and CUDA if available) without sneaking in `.cpu()` conversions.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md — Contains the authoritative C pix0 vector for the supervisor command; use it as the truth source when constructing `pix0_expected.json`.

How-To Map:
1. Export loop env: `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` and `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`; leave them set for every command in this loop.
2. Stage an `implementation/` workspace: `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation` and copy `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log` there for quick reference.
3. Derive the C expectation:
   - `grep DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt`
   - Convert meters to a JSON array (fast, slow, beam components) and save as `pix0_expected.json`; include 1e-12 precision so the regression has a tight bound.
4. Instrument the override math inside `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`:
   - Ensure `beam_vector`, `fdet_vec`, `sdet_vec`, and `odet_vec` tensors are on the detector device/dtype before projection.
   - Compute `beam_term = self.distance_corrected * beam_vector` (respecting tensor broadcasting) once; reuse it for both projections.
   - Set `pix0_delta = pix0_override_tensor - beam_term`; project onto `fdet_vec` and `sdet_vec` with `torch.dot` to obtain `Fbeam_override` and `Sbeam_override` tensors.
   - Recalculate beam-centre tensors: `self.beam_center_f = (Fbeam_override / self.pixel_size)` and `self.beam_center_s = (Sbeam_override / self.pixel_size)` while keeping dtype/device; update cached copies if needed.
   - Reuse the BEAM formula to set `self.pix0_vector` (no early returns) and recompute `self.close_distance = torch.dot(self.pix0_vector, self.odet_vec)` so r_factor consumers stay aligned.
   - Guard differentiability: no `.item()`, no branch that detaches tensors; rely on tensor comparisons via `torch.where` where needed.
5. Refresh caches: after mutating beam-centre tensors or pix0, ensure `_cached_basis_vectors` and `_cached_pix0_vector` are updated (the helper already does this on recalculation; confirm nothing short-circuits).
6. Add the regression to `tests/test_cli_flags.py`:
   - Create `class TestCLIPix0Override:` with a method `test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot(self, tmp_path)`.
   - Use the CLI harness (existing `run_cli_configuration` helper) to invoke the supervisor command parameters with `-pix0_vector_mm` (converted to the override seen in the C trace) and `-nonoise` to keep runtime short.
   - Load `pix0_expected.json`, compare against the detector’s pix0 tensor (`view_as_tensor`) with `torch.allclose(..., atol=5e-5, rtol=0)`.
   - Assert that the reported beam centres in the produced header (check `run_cli_configuration(..., return_config=True)`) match `Fbeam_override`/`Sbeam_override` converted back to mm.
   - Parametrise over `device in ['"'cpu', 'cuda']"'` with `pytest.mark.parametrize` guarded by `torch.cuda.is_available()` so CUDA coverage happens automatically when available.
7. Document math: create/append `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/implementation_notes.md` summarising the projection steps, tensor shapes, and why `beam_term` subtraction is required; include the numeric example from the trace for sanity.
8. Run targeted pytest on CPU and tee output: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cpu.log`.
9. If CUDA is available, rerun with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest ... --device cuda` (adapt harness as needed) and tee to `..._cuda.log`; document in notes whether CUDA was exercised or unavailable.
10. Re-run the trace harness without manual beam overrides (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py`) to verify pix0 parity numerically; diff against the stored C trace and save the diff as `trace_diff_after_H3b.txt` in the implementation directory.
11. Update `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt history with Attempt #22, citing the new artifacts (`pix0_expected.json`, pytest logs, trace diff) and summarising results (include numeric deltas for pix0 axes and beam centres).
12. Leave notes in `implementation_notes.md` on any follow-up needed for Phase H4 (e.g., polarization still pending) so the next loop can jump straight to parity validation.

Artifact Checklist:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json — authoritative C vector in meters.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cpu.log — targeted pytest output (CPU).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cuda.log — optional CUDA log.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_diff_after_H3b.txt — post-fix trace comparison against C.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/implementation_notes.md — math + decisions + next steps.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt — raw GREP output retained for provenance.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not bypass the projection by directly trusting the override; C recomputes via detector bases, and skipping this breaks parity.
- Avoid `.item()`, `.detach()`, or `.cpu()` on tensors that feed gradients; maintain autograd integrity.
- Do not forget to update `beam_center_f`/`beam_center_s` tensors; missing this drifts SMV headers and regresses config parity.
- Keep device/dtype neutrality: create new tensors with `device=self.device`, `dtype=self.dtype` to avoid implicit CPU allocations.
- Do not touch backup files (`detector.py.backup` etc.); all edits belong in the live module.
- Ensure caches are refreshed via existing mechanisms; failing to update `_cached_pix0_vector` will yield stale pixel coordinates.
- Stick to targeted pytest; the full suite waits until the change is stable.
- Preserve CUSTOM convention artefacts (beam/polar/spindle vectors) when overriding pix0; no accidental resets to MOSFLM defaults.
- Keep artifact filenames exactly as listed so plan cross-references stay valid.
- Document any blocking issues in `blocked.md` with commands + outputs if you cannot complete H3b this loop.

- Keep artifact filenames exactly as listed so plan cross-references stay valid.
- Document any blocking issues in `blocked.md` with commands + outputs if you cannot complete H3b this loop.

commit: 2113548
author: galph
Active Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H3b — enforce BEAM-pivot pix0 override parity

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase H3b) — run "'`env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v`

If Blocked: Capture fresh C & PyTorch traces via `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py`, stash outputs plus first-divergence notes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/blocked.md`, and record an Attempt in docs/fix_plan.md so the next supervisor loop has evidence.

Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Next Actions enumerate the projection math, regression node, and artifact drop points required to unblock Phase H4.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:91 — Phase H3b guidance specifies the beam-term subtraction and beam-centre recomputation we must follow verbatim.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35 — Canonical BEAM pivot equation; the override path must flow through this exact formula to stay spec compliant.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:53 — Mapping between CLI beam flags and DetectorConfig ensures header parity once we rewrite beam centres from override-derived offsets.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:18 — Device/dtype discipline and targeted test requirements govern validation once code changes land.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md — Contains the authoritative C pix0 vector for the supervisor command; we must encode it into `pix0_expected.json`.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1833 — Source-of-truth C snippet showing the BEAM pivot transform we are replicating.
- scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py — Parallel trace harness to confirm pix0 alignment before moving to lattice parity.

How-To Map:
1. Export loop env: `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` and `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any command; keep both for the entire session.
2. Prepare workspace directories:
   - `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation`
   - `cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_trace_reference.log`
3. Derive the C expectation:
   - `grep DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt`
   - Convert the meters-valued triple into JSON with 1e-12 precision; save as `pix0_expected.json` alongside the text file.
4. Update `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py` (BEAM pivot branch):
   - Ensure all tensors (`beam_vector`, `fdet_vec`, `sdet_vec`, `odet_vec`) are on the detector device/dtype.
   - Compute `beam_term = self.distance_corrected * beam_vector` using tensor ops only.
   - Set `pix0_delta = pix0_override_tensor - beam_term` and project onto detector axes to get `Fbeam_override`/`Sbeam_override` (use `torch.dot`).
   - Recalculate `self.beam_center_f` and `self.beam_center_s` in pixel units via division by `self.pixel_size`; keep gradients and device alignment intact.
   - Reuse the standard formula `self.pix0_vector = -Fbeam * self.fdet_vec - Sbeam * self.sdet_vec + self.distance_corrected * beam_vector`.
   - Refresh `self.close_distance = torch.dot(self.pix0_vector, self.odet_vec)` so obliquity math stays consistent.
   - Leave SAMPLE pivot path untouched; add guards so override logic triggers only for BEAM pivot.
5. Verify caches: confirm `_cached_pix0_vector` and `_cached_basis_vectors` refresh naturally after `_calculate_pix0_vector()`; adjust if the override path previously returned early.
6. Add regression to `tests/test_cli_flags.py`:
   - Introduce `class TestCLIPix0Override` with helper fixtures for CLI invocation.
   - Parameterize over `device in ['"'cpu', 'cuda']"'` (guard CUDA availability) so both pathways are checked when possible.
   - CLI invocation must include `-pix0_vector_mm` with supervisor command values, `-nonoise`, and the existing plan-controlled ROI to keep runtime modest.
   - Load `pix0_expected.json` and compare to the detector-side pix0 tensor with `torch.allclose(..., atol=5e-5, rtol=0)`.
   - Assert that CLI-reported beam centres (fast/slow mm) map back to the override-derived offsets; rely on header parsing helpers if available.
7. Extend regression coverage: check that `Detector.r_factor` remains finite and that `distance_corrected` equals the C trace value (store both numbers in notes for trace comparison).
8. Document math and evidence in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/implementation_notes.md`:
   - Outline the projection derivation step-by-step.
   - Log numeric values for `Fbeam_override`, `Sbeam_override`, `close_distance`, and beam centres in both meters and mm.
   - Record any device/dtype considerations or guards added.
9. Run targeted pytest on CPU:
   - `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cpu.log`
   - Confirm the log shows the new test passing and no regressions in neighbouring CLI tests.
10. If CUDA is available, rerun with GPU:
    - `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v --device cuda | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cuda.log`
    - Add a note if CUDA is unavailable, citing the command output.
11. Refresh trace comparison:
    - `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_py_after_H3b.log`
    - Diff against the existing C trace (`diff -u ... trace_py_after_H3b.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/c_trace_beam.log > .../trace_diff_after_H3b.txt`).
12. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history with Attempt #22 summarising implementation results, pytest status, trace diff outcome, and stored artifacts.
13. Leave a brief TODO in `implementation_notes.md` for Phase H4 (e.g., polarization still pending) so follow-up work is explicit.

Artifact Checklist:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt — raw DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR line from C trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json — JSON copy used by the regression.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/implementation_notes.md — math, tensor values, next actions.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cpu.log — CPU pytest output.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cuda.log — CUDA pytest output (or note absence).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_py_after_H3b.log — post-fix PyTorch trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_diff_after_H3b.txt — diff vs C reference trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/blocked.md — only if progress stalls; include commands + stdout.

Verification Checklist:
- [ ] New regression passes on CPU and, when possible, CUDA.
- [ ] `self.pix0_vector` matches C within 5e-5 m on all components.
- [ ] `beam_center_f`/`beam_center_s` tensors update and remain differentiable (check `.requires_grad`).
- [ ] `self.close_distance` equals the dot product of pix0 and odet (log both values in notes).
- [ ] Trace diff shows no divergence in pix0, Fbeam, Sbeam, or incident beam lines.
- [ ] docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #22 added with artifact references.
- [ ] No unintended modifications to `detector.py.backup` or other protected files.
- [ ] Working tree clean except for intentional changes and new artifacts before finishing.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Directly assigning `pix0_override` to `self.pix0_vector` skips the BEAM formula and breaks parity.
- `.item()` or `.detach()` on tensors severs gradient flow; keep operations tensor-bound.
- Forgetting to update beam-centre tensors leaves SMV headers inconsistent with pix0.
- Implicit CPU tensor creation (e.g., `torch.tensor([...])` without device) will crash CUDA runs.
- Editing archive or backup files (e.g., `detector.py.backup`) instead of the live module.
- Skipping cache refresh leads to stale pixel coordinate caches and bogus traces.
- Running the full pytest suite violates the testing cadence for this loop; stick to targeted nodes.
- Ignoring CUSTOM convention side-effects (beam/polar/spindle vectors) risks regressions in other CLI scenarios.
- Failing to capture artifacts before git commit leaves plan items unverifiable.
- Omitting Attempt updates in docs/fix_plan.md obscures progress and blocks future loops.

Trace Validation Steps:
- Confirm `TRACE_PY: pix0_vector` lines match the C trace numerically.
- Check `TRACE_PY: Fbeam_m` and `TRACE_PY: Sbeam_m` after the fix to ensure offsets updated.
- Verify `TRACE_PY: distance_m` equals C `distance` (post r-factor correction).
- Ensure `TRACE_PY: incident_beam` still reflects the CLI custom vector.
- Document any remaining divergence in `trace_diff_after_H3b.txt` with hypotheses.

- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:91 — Phase H3b guidance specifies the beam-term subtraction and beam-centre recomputation we must follow verbatim.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35 — Canonical BEAM pivot equation; the override path must flow through this exact formula to stay spec compliant.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:53 — Mapping between CLI beam flags and DetectorConfig ensures header parity once we rewrite beam centres from override-derived offsets.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:18 — Device/dtype discipline and targeted test requirements govern validation once code changes land.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md — Contains the authoritative C pix0 vector for the supervisor command; we must encode it into `pix0_expected.json`.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1833 — Source-of-truth C snippet showing the BEAM pivot transform we are replicating.
- scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py — Parallel trace harness to confirm pix0 alignment before moving to lattice parity.

How-To Map:
1. Export loop env: `export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` and `export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` before any command; keep both for the entire session.
2. Prepare workspace directories:
   - `mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation`
   - `cp reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_trace_reference.log`
3. Derive the C expectation:
   - `grep DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt`
   - Convert the meters-valued triple into JSON with 1e-12 precision; save as `pix0_expected.json` alongside the text file.
4. Update `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py` (BEAM pivot branch):
   - Ensure all tensors (`beam_vector`, `fdet_vec`, `sdet_vec`, `odet_vec`) are on the detector device/dtype.
   - Compute `beam_term = self.distance_corrected * beam_vector` using tensor ops only.
   - Set `pix0_delta = pix0_override_tensor - beam_term` and project onto detector axes to get `Fbeam_override`/`Sbeam_override` (use `torch.dot`).
   - Recalculate `self.beam_center_f` and `self.beam_center_s` in pixel units via division by `self.pixel_size`; keep gradients and device alignment intact.
   - Reuse the standard formula `self.pix0_vector = -Fbeam * self.fdet_vec - Sbeam * self.sdet_vec + self.distance_corrected * beam_vector`.
   - Refresh `self.close_distance = torch.dot(self.pix0_vector, self.odet_vec)` so obliquity math stays consistent.
   - Leave SAMPLE pivot path untouched; add guards so override logic triggers only for BEAM pivot.
5. Verify caches: confirm `_cached_pix0_vector` and `_cached_basis_vectors` refresh naturally after `_calculate_pix0_vector()`; adjust if the override path previously returned early.
6. Add regression to `tests/test_cli_flags.py`:
   - Introduce `class TestCLIPix0Override` with helper fixtures for CLI invocation.
   - Parameterize over `device in ['"'cpu', 'cuda']"'` (guard CUDA availability) so both pathways are checked when possible.
   - CLI invocation must include `-pix0_vector_mm` with supervisor command values, `-nonoise`, and the existing plan-controlled ROI to keep runtime modest.
   - Load `pix0_expected.json` and compare to the detector-side pix0 tensor with `torch.allclose(..., atol=5e-5, rtol=0)`.
   - Assert that CLI-reported beam centres (fast/slow mm) map back to the override-derived offsets; rely on header parsing helpers if available.
7. Extend regression coverage: check that `Detector.r_factor` remains finite and that `distance_corrected` equals the C trace value (store both numbers in notes for trace comparison).
8. Document math and evidence in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/implementation_notes.md`:
   - Outline the projection derivation step-by-step.
   - Log numeric values for `Fbeam_override`, `Sbeam_override`, `close_distance`, and beam centres in both meters and mm.
   - Record any device/dtype considerations or guards added.
9. Run targeted pytest on CPU:
   - `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cpu.log`
   - Confirm the log shows the new test passing and no regressions in neighbouring CLI tests.
10. If CUDA is available, rerun with GPU:
    - `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot -v --device cuda | tee reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cuda.log`
    - Add a note if CUDA is unavailable, citing the command output.
11. Refresh trace comparison:
    - `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_py_after_H3b.log`
    - Diff against the existing C trace (`diff -u ... trace_py_after_H3b.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/c_trace_beam.log > .../trace_diff_after_H3b.txt`).
12. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history with Attempt #22 summarising implementation results, pytest status, trace diff outcome, and stored artifacts.
13. Leave a brief TODO in `implementation_notes.md` for Phase H4 (e.g., polarization still pending) so follow-up work is explicit.

Artifact Checklist:
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.txt — raw DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR line from C trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json — JSON copy used by the regression.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/implementation_notes.md — math, tensor values, next actions.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cpu.log — CPU pytest output.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pytest_TestCLIPix0Override_cuda.log — CUDA pytest output (or note absence).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_py_after_H3b.log — post-fix PyTorch trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/trace_diff_after_H3b.txt — diff vs C reference trace.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/blocked.md — only if progress stalls; include commands + stdout.

Verification Checklist:
- [ ] New regression passes on CPU and, when possible, CUDA.
- [ ] `self.pix0_vector` matches C within 5e-5 m on all components.
- [ ] `beam_center_f`/`beam_center_s` tensors update and remain differentiable (check `.requires_grad`).
- [ ] `self.close_distance` equals the dot product of pix0 and odet (log both values in notes).
- [ ] Trace diff shows no divergence in pix0, Fbeam, Sbeam, or incident beam lines.
- [ ] docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #22 added with artifact references.
- [ ] No unintended modifications to `detector.py.backup` or other protected files.
- [ ] Working tree clean except for intentional changes and new artifacts before finishing.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Directly assigning `pix0_override` to `self.pix0_vector` skips the BEAM formula and breaks parity.
- `.item()` or `.detach()` on tensors severs gradient flow; keep operations tensor-bound.
- Forgetting to update beam-centre tensors leaves SMV headers inconsistent with pix0.
- Implicit CPU tensor creation (e.g., `torch.tensor([...])` without device) will crash CUDA runs.
- Editing archive or backup files (e.g., `detector.py.backup`) instead of the live module.
- Skipping cache refresh leads to stale pixel coordinate caches and bogus traces.
- Running the full pytest suite violates the testing cadence for this loop; stick to targeted nodes.
- Ignoring CUSTOM convention side-effects (beam/polar/spindle vectors) risks regressions in other CLI scenarios.
- Failing to capture artifacts before git commit leaves plan items unverifiable.
- Omitting Attempt updates in docs/fix_plan.md obscures progress and blocks future loops.

Trace Validation Steps:
- Confirm `TRACE_PY: pix0_vector` lines match the C trace numerically.
- Check `TRACE_PY: Fbeam_m` and `TRACE_PY: Sbeam_m` after the fix to ensure offsets updated.
- Verify `TRACE_PY: distance_m` equals C `distance` (post r-factor correction).
- Ensure `TRACE_PY: incident_beam` still reflects the CLI custom vector.
- Document any remaining divergence in `trace_diff_after_H3b.txt` with hypotheses.

  1051	## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — H3 sincg diagnosis setup)
  1052	- Git already up to date (15fdec5); mandatory spec/arch/testing docs and active plans refreshed before analysis.
  1053	- Long-term Goal 1: New Phase H3 evidence (commit ce28187) shows `F_latt` mismatch; confirmed top hypothesis is PyTorch feeding `(h-h0)` into `sincg`. Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` H3 guidance to require manual `sincg(M_PI*h, Na)` reproduction and hypothesis logging before any simulator edits.
  1054	- docs/fix_plan.md `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Next Actions now point at rerunning `trace_harness.py`, capturing manual `sincg` calculations, then executing Phase H4 once the lattice fix is staged.
  1055	- Coin flip=heads → reviewed Ralph’s latest code commit (ce28187). Evidence-only trace capture landed as expected, no regressions observed; productive iteration highlighting sincg vs lattice scaling suspects.
  1056	- Long-term Goal 2: `plans/active/vectorization.md` Phase A updated to author reusable tricubic/absorption benchmark harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so baseline timings can be captured once CLI parity stabilises; fix_plan Next Actions adjusted accordingly.
  1057	- Authored new input.md (Do Now: rerun trace harness, compute manual sincg table, pytest collect) and staged reporting guardrails for today’s evidence-only loop.
  1058	- Follow-ups for Ralph: regenerate PyTorch trace under `trace_py_after_H3.log`, create `manual_sincg.md` comparing `(h-h0)` vs absolute arguments, append findings to `implementation_notes.md`, and keep Attempt log current before proposing the simulator fix.
  1059	## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3 pix0 evidence refresh)
  1060	- Re-read core docs + active plans; long-term Goal 1 still blocked by Phase H3 lattice parity, Goal 2 (vectorization) queued until CLI parity stabilises.
  1061	- Evidence review: trace diff shows 1.14 mm gap between PyTorch `pix0_override_m` and C’s BEAM-pivot transform, cascading to pixel_pos, scattering_vec, and h/k/l deltas. Sincg confirmed equivalent; root cause is detector pix0 override handling.
  1062	- Plan upkeep: updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H exit criteria and H3 task to require reproducing C’s pix0 math + restoring attempt log. docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions now point at capturing `pix0_reproduction.md`, propagating deltas, and logging Attempt #21 properly before code edits.
  1063	- Coin flip = heads → reviewed Ralph commits `ce28187`, `4e0e36e` (evidence-only, productive; no regressions). Feedback captured in input.md.
  1064	- Authored new input.md directing Ralph to rerun trace harness, build pix0 reproduction notebook, clean up `attempt_log.txt`, append implementation notes, and run `pytest --collect-only -q` (evidence loop).
  1065	- Follow-ups for Ralph next loop: produce the refreshed trace + pix0 reproduction artifacts, restore the attempt log with human-readable Attempt #21, log findings in implementation_notes.md, keep work evidence-only pending detector fix design.
  1066	
  1067	## 2025-10-06 (galph loop — Phase H3b kick-off)
  1068	- `git pull --rebase` clean. Reviewed core docs + active plans + testing strategy per SOP.
  1069	- Goal 1: Phase H3 evidence (Attempt #21) now complete; updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` to split H3 into H3a (done) and new H3b implementation task, and refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Next Actions to focus on applying the BEAM-pivot transform plus regression test.
  1070	- Goal 1 follow-up: Authored new input.md directing Ralph to implement the pix0 transform, add a targeted CLI regression test, capture artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`, and document Attempt #22 before moving to parity (Phase H4).

 ### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)


[2025-10-06T07:20:48] thinking

**Preparing final message details**
[2025-10-06T07:20:48] codex

**Key Updates**
- Tightened Phase H3b guidance for pix0 overrides in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:101`, spelling out the projection math, beam-centre tensor updates, regression expectation, and artifact paths.
- Synced `docs/fix_plan.md:448` Next Actions with the revised workflow, mandating `pix0_expected.json`, targeted pytest coverage, and Attempt #22 documentation.
- Reissued `input.md:1` with the required summary header plus a 121-line Do Now playbook covering env setup, implementation steps, artifact checklist, and CUDA guidance.
- Logged the loop outcome and coin-flip=tails note in `galph_memory.md:1075` so future runs inherit today’s decisions.

**Notes**
- Tests: not run (planning/documentation loop).
- Coin flip → tails; per SOP no retrospective commit audit this turn.

**Next Steps**
1. Implement Phase H3b per the new memo (projection into detector basis, regen beam centres, reuse BEAM pivot formula).
2. Add the targeted CLI regression (`tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot`) and capture artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`.
3. Upon success, advance to Phase H4 lattice parity verification and resume polarization work thereafter.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions: (1) Execute Phase H3b by applying the BEAM-pivot pix0 transformation when `pix0_override_m` is provided (match nanoBragg.c lines 1833-1835), ensuring differentiability/device neutrality and capturing implementation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/`; (2) Add a targeted regression test exercising CUSTOM `-pix0_vector_mm` to prove the transformed pix0 matches the C formula (store pytest log alongside the implementation artifacts); (3) Update `phase_h/implementation_notes.md` with fix details and append Attempt #22 in the plan log; (4) After the fix lands, proceed to Phase H4 parity smoke (polarization disabled) and, once lattice parity is confirmed, continue to Phase I polarization alignment and repository cleanup (e.g., removing `scaled.hkl.1`).
+- Next Actions: (1) Execute Phase H3b by projecting any `pix0_override_m` through the detector basis before recomputing pix0 (subtract the beam term, compute `Fbeam_override = -⟨pix0_override - distance_corrected·beam, fdet⟩` and `Sbeam_override = -⟨…, sdet⟩`, update `beam_center_f/s` tensors accordingly, then reuse the BEAM formula) while preserving differentiability/device neutrality; (2) Capture the expected C pix0 vector in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_expected.json`, add a targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_flags.py` that drives the CLI with `-pix0_vector_mm` and asserts the transformed pix0 and beam-centre headers match the trace, and store the pytest log under the same directory; (3) Update `phase_h/implementation_notes.md` with fix details and append Attempt #22 in the plan log; (4) After the fix lands, proceed to Phase H4 parity smoke (polarization disabled) and, once lattice parity is confirmed, continue to Phase I polarization alignment and repository cleanup (e.g., removing `scaled.hkl.1`).
