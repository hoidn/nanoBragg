this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-12-02): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Phase E1 regression sweep finished (artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`); Phase E2–E3 remain open ahead of detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

### C-PARITY-001 — φ=0 Uses Stale Crystal Vectors (Medium)
**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel's final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

    Implemented Phase M1 per input.md Do Now directive:
    - Added --phi-mode {spec,c-parity} flag to trace_harness.py
    - Routed flag to crystal_config.phi_carryover_mode before Crystal instantiation
    - Added phi_carryover_mode to config snapshot JSON for provenance
    
    Evidence:
    - Fresh c-parity trace captured: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/
    - I_before_scaling still diverges 8.7% (C: 943654.8, Py: 861314.8)
    - All scaling chain factors match C within tolerance (≤1.57e-07 relative)
    - Confirms divergence is NOT in phi rotation logic, narrows to structure factor accumulation
    
    Tests: Regression test PASSED (4/4 in 2.50s). Test collection: 699 tests.

**Evaluating recent work and planning needs**

I'm reviewing recent commits and progress related to phi-mode override and vectorization plans. There's evidence of consistent work toward long-term goals, but I want to check if existing plans—especially for CLI tasks and phi bug verification—are still aligned with current objectives or need updates. I'll look into related specs, plans like `cli-noise-pix0` and `cli-phi-parity-shim`, and assess if multi-turn planning or documentation adjustments are necessary.

[2025-10-08T05:10:18] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md' succeeded in 670ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-12-01 refresh): Spec baseline locked, opt-in parity shim landed (Attempts #120/#121), and the dtype sensitivity probe in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/` confirmed the Δk≈2.845e-05 plateau is inherent to the C carryover bug. Decision logged to relax the VG-1 tolerance for c-parity mode to |Δk| ≤ 5e-5; documentation/test updates (Phase C5/D) remain outstanding.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-12-02): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Phase E1 regression sweep finished (artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/`); Phase E2–E3 remain open ahead of detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

Sampling & Accumulation (Normative)

- Loop order per pixel within ROI and unmasked:
    - For each detector thickness layer index t = 0..thicksteps-1:
        - Odet = t·(thickness/steps) (meters).
        - For subpixel grid (oversample × oversample):
            - Compute detector-plane coordinates (meters): Fdet and Sdet at subpixel centers.

enabled, an alternative spherical mapping is used: start at distance along b and rotate about s and
f by small angles Sdet/distance and Fdet/distance respectively.
            - Diffracted unit vector d = unit(P); airpath R = ||P||.

                - Capture fraction for this layer: exp(−t·Δz·μ/ρ) − exp(−(t+1)·Δz·μ/ρ), where Δz =
thickness/steps.

**Analyzing Pyro aggregator discrepancies**

I'm investigating why the PyTorch aggregator reports a lower I_before_scaling value compared to expectations, suspecting missed contributions or differences in how phi steps are combined. I'll examine the relevant simulator and model code to understand how intensity sums and weightings are calculated to spot potential causes.

**Analyzing intensity calculation differences**

I'm thinking through possible reasons the intensity difference of about 8.7% occurs between C and pyro, considering how factors like `F_latt`, `F_cell`, polarization, and phi dimension summations might vary or be applied differently in the computations. I want to verify if vectorization, interpolation rounding, or selective phi summation in pyro could explain the discrepancy.

**Analyzing instrumentation mismatch in intensity scaling**

I'm unpacking why PyTorch and C intensity-before-scaling values differ—turns out PyTorch logs include polarization, but C's don’t, explaining the key 8.7% discrepancy. To confirm, I’m reviewing C code to see exactly when polarization is applied relative to logging. Next, I plan to create a debug summary documenting these findings and recommend adjusting PyTorch tracing to output intensity before polarization, which should help align parity checks and guide next debugging steps.
[2025-10-08T05:16:22] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
# Debug Note — I_before_scaling Mismatch (galph 2025-12-03)

## Context
- Item: "'`[CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase M` (trace harness parity for supervisor command)
- Pixel: (slow=685, fast=1039)
- PyTorch trace: `trace_py_scaling_cpu.log`
- C trace: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`
- Observation: `I_before_scaling` differs by −8.726% (PyTorch lower)

## Finding
- PyTorch trace records `I_before_scaling` *after* polarization is applied inside `compute_physics_for_position`, because `_apply_debug_output` taps `I_total` **after** `intensity = intensity * polar`.
- nanoBragg.c prints `TRACE_C: I_before_scaling` **before** the `polar` factor is multiplied.
- C value × polarization aligns with PyTorch:
  - C trace: `I_before_scaling = 943654.80923755`
  - C trace: `polar = 0.91463969894451`
  - Product: `943654.80923755 × 0.91463969894451 = 863104.1506`
  - PyTorch trace: `I_before_scaling = 861314.8125`
  - Residual delta (≈−0.2%) matches float32 rounding + small `F_latt` drift (<0.2%).

## Evidence
- PyTorch per-φ lattice factors (`reports/.../per_phi/.../trace_py_scaling_cpu_per_phi.log`) match C within ~1e-3 and yield Σ|F|² ≈ 9.42×10⁵ before polarization.
- Difference between C and PyTorch `I_before_scaling` equals C value × (1 − polar).

## Implication
- The "first divergence" flagged in Attempt #137 is an instrumentation misalignment, not a physics bug.
- Phase M1 should update the comparison script (or PyTorch trace) to emit the **pre-polarization** intensity so metrics align with C.
- Once traces are aligned, the true first divergence will likely move to the next factor (e.g., final intensity or residual rounding).

## Next Steps (for Phase M2)
1. Adjust `_apply_debug_output` (or trace harness) to log both:
   - `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`
   - `I_before_scaling_post_polar`
   ensuring the pre-polar value matches C.
2. Re-run `compare_scaling_traces.py` with the updated tap; expect the I_before delta to drop to ~0.2% (float32 effects).

# Debug Note — I_before_scaling Mismatch (galph 2025-12-03)

## Context
- Item: "'`[CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase M` (trace harness parity for supervisor command)
- Pixel: (slow=685, fast=1039)
- PyTorch trace: `trace_py_scaling_cpu.log`
- C trace: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`
- Observation: `I_before_scaling` differs by −8.726% (PyTorch lower)

## Finding
- PyTorch trace records `I_before_scaling` *after* polarization is applied inside `compute_physics_for_position`, because `_apply_debug_output` taps `I_total` **after** `intensity = intensity * polar`.
- nanoBragg.c prints `TRACE_C: I_before_scaling` **before** the `polar` factor is multiplied.
- C value × polarization aligns with PyTorch:
  - C trace: `I_before_scaling = 943654.80923755`
  - C trace: `polar = 0.91463969894451`
  - Product: `943654.80923755 × 0.91463969894451 = 863104.1506`
  - PyTorch trace: `I_before_scaling = 861314.8125`
  - Residual delta (≈−0.2%) matches float32 rounding + small `F_latt` drift (<0.2%).

## Evidence
- PyTorch per-φ lattice factors (`reports/.../per_phi/.../trace_py_scaling_cpu_per_phi.log`) match C within ~1e-3 and yield Σ|F|² ≈ 9.42×10⁵ before polarization.
- Difference between C and PyTorch `I_before_scaling` equals C value × (1 − polar).

## Implication
- The "first divergence" flagged in Attempt #137 is an instrumentation misalignment, not a physics bug.
- Phase M1 should update the comparison script (or PyTorch trace) to emit the **pre-polarization** intensity so metrics align with C.
- Once traces are aligned, the true first divergence will likely move to the next factor (e.g., final intensity or residual rounding).

## Next Steps (for Phase M2)
1. Adjust `_apply_debug_output` (or trace harness) to log both:
   - `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`
   - `I_before_scaling_post_polar`
   ensuring the pre-polar value matches C.
2. Re-run `compare_scaling_traces.py` with the updated tap; expect the I_before delta to drop to ~0.2% (float32 effects).
3. Resume Phase M2 focus on structure-factor parity once instrumentation is synchronized.

**Planning fix_plan documentation update**

I’m weighing whether to update docs/fix_plan.md to include a new note about the instrumentation mismatch found in CLI-FLAGS-003. Since the plan is large, I want to locate the CLI-FLAGS-003 section and ideally add a bullet under Observations or Next Actions to keep track of this important debug insight for Ralph and future reference.

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **C State Carryover Mechanism Identified**: C trace evidence (c_trace_phi_202510070839.log lines 266-287) showed that C implementation carries over rotation state from previous φ steps when processing φ=0, resulting in rot_b_y=0.671588 instead of the expected 0.0. This behavior is not a bug in C but an implementation artifact that PyTorch must replicate for exact parity.
      - **Cache Implementation Strategy**: Introduced `_phi_last_cache` dictionary to store {phi_values_key: (rotated_a, rotated_b, rotated_c)} from previous calls. On subsequent calls, when phi array starts with 0.0, use cached vectors from the last non-zero phi of the previous batch instead of computing fresh identity rotation.
      - **Per-φ Formula Correction**: The instrumentation formula for per-φ angle was using `phi_i * osc / (phi_steps - 1)`, which is incorrect for a 0-indexed range. Changed to `phi_i * osc / phi_steps` to match C's convention where phi_steps divides the oscillation range evenly (0°, 0.1°, 0.2°, ... for osc=1° and phi_steps=10).
      - **Test Result — test_rot_b_matches_c**: PASSED with rot_b_y matching C reference 0.671588 within absolute tolerance 1e-6. This confirms the cache mechanism correctly emulates C state carryover.
      - **Test Result — test_k_frac_phi0_matches_c**: FAILED, but this appears to be a pre-existing test issue unrelated to the φ=0 carryover fix. The test expects k_frac=-0.607255 but PyTorch currently computes a different value. This requires separate investigation (likely related to upstream geometry or incident beam direction).
      - **Device/Dtype Neutrality Maintained**: Cache stores tensors on original device/dtype; all cache lookups use tensor comparison without .item() calls in differentiable paths.
      - **Backward Compatibility**: Cache mechanism only activates when phi array starts with 0.0; all other phi sequences (non-zero start, monotonic, non-sequential) use standard rotation pipeline.
    Next Actions:
      - **Phase L3k.3c.3 (VG-1 validation)**: Regenerate per-φ traces with updated instrumentation formula and φ=0 cache enabled; run comparison script to verify VG-1 thresholds (Δk ≤ 1e-6, Δb_y relative error ≤ 1e-6) are now satisfied.
      - **Phase L3k.3c.5 (full test suite regression)**: Run full pytest suite to ensure φ=0 cache does not break existing rotation tests or introduce precision regressions.
      - **Investigate test_k_frac_phi0_matches_c failure**: This test failure is orthogonal to the φ=0 carryover fix. Requires separate debugging to identify why k_frac value diverges from C reference (likely upstream geometry issue in incident beam direction or scattering vector calculation).
      - **Update plan status**: Mark Phase L3k.3c as complete once VG-1 validation passes; document cache mechanism in architecture/crystal.md for future maintainers.

      - Updated fix-plan Next Actions (this entry)
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - VG-1 threshold in `fix_checklist.md` is 1e-6, so the 2.84e-05 result is insufficient despite being <5e-4. Need higher-precision carryover (or spec-compliant default + parity shim).
      - Artifact directories should avoid nested `.../per_phi/reports/...` duplication to keep future comparisons sane.
      - Spec review required: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 mandates no φ=0 carryover; PyTorch must offer spec-compliant default behavior while optionally emulating the C trace for parity workflows.
    Next Actions: Keep L3k.3c.3 open, produce new per-φ traces post-fix, author the spec/bug memo (L3k.3c.6), and only then move on to ROI/normalization gates.
  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #115 (ralph Mode: Docs — Phase L3k.3c.6) — Result: **DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE** (Spec vs Parity Contract memo). **No code changes.**
    Metrics: Documentation-only (no tests executed; pytest --collect-only succeeds with 655 tests collected).
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md:116-262` — New "Phase L3k.3c.6 — Spec vs Parity Contract" section
      - Git SHA at completion: (to be recorded at commit)
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **Spec-compliant behavior** (specs/spec-a-core.md:211): φ sampling formula mandates no φ=0 carryover; each rotation step is independent
      - **C-code bug** (docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166 — C-PARITY-001): C implementation contains `if(phi != 0.0)` guard causing stale vector carryover from previous pixel
      - **Current parity delta** (Δk=2.845e-05) is **expected divergence**, not implementation bug; PyTorch correctly implements spec while C has documented bug
      - **Recommendation**: Either (a) relax VG-1 threshold to Δk ≤ 5e-5 and document as known divergence, OR (b) implement optional `--c-parity-phi-carryover` flag for validation-only C-bug emulation
      - **Memo structure**: Normative behavior, observed bug, current evidence, implementation strategy (default vs parity mode), recommendation, references, next actions
    Next Actions (per diagnosis.md § "Next Actions"):
      - **Immediate**: Review memo with galph (supervisor loop) to decide threshold adjustment vs parity shim implementation
      - If threshold adjustment: Update VG-1 gate in `fix_checklist.md` to Δk ≤ 5e-5, document rationale linking to C-PARITY-001

    `PY`
- First Divergence (if known): `parse_and_validate_args` (src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:435) calls `read_hkl_file`/`try_load_hkl_or_fdump` without forwarding the parsed dtype, so HKL/Fdump data is always loaded as float32. When the CLI is run with `-dtype float64`, the simulator converts those float32 tensors to float64 later, permanently losing precision relative to the requested double-precision path and violating the DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 guarantee.
- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
- Attempts History: None — new item.
- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

**Preparing detailed instructions for input.md**

I'm putting together a thorough `input.md` for Ralph that aligns with the plan item `[CLI-FLAGS-003]`, focusing on Phase M1 instrumentation updates. I'll include sections like Summary, Mode, Focus, Branch, Mapped tests, Artifacts, Do Now with explicit commands to update instrumentation and re-run validation scripts, and cover pitfalls and next steps to ensure clarity and alignment before moving on to the next step.
[2025-10-08T05:17:42] exec bash -lc "cat <<'EOF' > input.md
Summary: Sync PyTorch trace instrumentation with C so Phase M compares the same pre-polarization intensity.
Mode: Parity
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M (scaling parity instrumentation)
Branch: main (expected)
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — run "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` after updating the trace to emit both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then invoke `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
If Blocked: Capture the failure (stderr + logs) under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and document in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before requesting guidance.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 hinge on correct trace taps; logging mismatch stalled scaling parity.
- docs/fix_plan.md: First divergence now traces to polarization timing; need trace parity before touching physics.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md explains evidence; instrument fix unlocks Phase M progress.
- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation: `I_term` defined before polarization so traces must reflect same stage.
How-To Map:
- Edit `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output` (and trace harness plumbing) to print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` before polarization and keep current post-polar line (rename accordingly).
- Re-run harness command above on CPU; store outputs, commands.txt, metrics.json, sha256.txt under the new timestamp directory.
- Validate with compare_scaling_traces.py; confirm the summary shows ≤1e-6 relative delta for the pre-polar metric and document results.
- Finish with `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm selector validity (no need to execute tests yet).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not overwrite existing evidence folders; create a fresh timestamped directory.
- Preserve vectorized code paths; no ad-hoc loops when adding instrumentation.
- Keep device/dtype neutrality (no hard-coded `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors).
- Respect Protected Assets (`docs/index.md` list); do not move/delete entries.
- Ensure both pre- and post-polar traces honor existing naming conventions (`TRACE_PY:` prefix).
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md §Phase M — instrumentation prerequisites.
- docs/fix_plan.md:445-520 — CLI-FLAGS-003 context and updated divergence note.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md — polarization analysis.
- specs/spec-a-core.md: Sampling & Accumulation block (lines ~200-260) — reference stage definitions.
Next Up: Once trace parity is green, proceed to plan tasks M2/M3 (structure-factor validation and scaling regression test) using the refreshed harness.

If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
How-To Map:
- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.

 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

 - specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
 - Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.

 - specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
 - Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**

 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
 If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.

 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
 If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.

+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**

+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.

+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.

 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**

+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
 Branch: main (expected)
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py

 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.

-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
 Branch: main (expected)
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.

+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.

-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.
 - Attempts History:
   * [2025-10-07] Attempt #136 (ralph loop i=135, Mode: Docs) — Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** (Phase L Documentation Sync COMPLETE). **No code changes.**

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.

Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.

 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.

+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.

+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace).

+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace).

-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.

-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.

+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.

+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**

The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace).

 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.

 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.

-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

**Preparing final response and memory update**

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.

 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.

+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.

The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row).

+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.

+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

+Next Up Detail: When moving to M2, reuse the updated harness to capture per-φ F_cell/F_latt contributions so structure-factor mismatches can be isolated quickly.

# Debug Note — I_before_scaling Mismatch (galph 2025-12-03)

## Context
- Item: `[CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase M` (trace harness parity for supervisor command)
- Pixel: (slow=685, fast=1039)
- PyTorch trace: `trace_py_scaling_cpu.log`
- C trace: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`
- Observation: `I_before_scaling` differs by −8.726% (PyTorch lower)

## Finding
- PyTorch trace records `I_before_scaling` *after* polarization is applied inside `compute_physics_for_position`, because `_apply_debug_output` taps `I_total` **after** `intensity = intensity * polar`.
- nanoBragg.c prints `TRACE_C: I_before_scaling` **before** the `polar` factor is multiplied.
- C value × polarization aligns with PyTorch:
  - C trace: `I_before_scaling = 943654.80923755`
  - C trace: `polar = 0.91463969894451`
  - Product: `943654.80923755 × 0.91463969894451 = 863104.1506`
  - PyTorch trace: `I_before_scaling = 861314.8125`
  - Residual delta (≈−0.2%) matches float32 rounding + small `F_latt` drift (<0.2%).

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.

-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**.

 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py

+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization. See `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` for evidence (C value × polar ≈ PyTorch trace). Next trace update must emit the pre-polarization intensity so parity metrics align.
 - Next Actions (2025-12-02 refresh → galph supervision):
 1. **Phase L documentation sync** — Execute `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` tasks L1–L3 to propagate the spec vs c-parity dual-threshold guidance across `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`, `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, and `fix_checklist.md` (VG-1 row). Confirm the spec shards (`specs/spec-a-core.md` / `specs/spec-a-cli.md`) remain unchanged so the φ carryover bug stays quarantined in docs/bugs.
-2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: run `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, fix the missing `F_cell` fetch within `_tricubic_interpolation`, and add the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
+2. **Phase M scaling parity** — Drive plan tasks M1–M3: rerun `trace_harness.py` for the supervisor ROI, update `_apply_debug_output`/trace plumbing so `I_before_scaling` taps the **pre-polarization** accumulator (per `galph_debug_20251203.md`), then continue with the targeted regression in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` so `I_before_scaling` matches C within ≤1e-6 relative error on CPU+CUDA.
 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.

+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

 Summary: Align PyTorch `I_before_scaling` trace output with the C reference so Phase M scaling parity can move forward without false divergences.
+Summary Detail: This loop is instrumentation-only—no physics edits—focused on making the trace harness compare apples-to-apples before returning to structure-factor parity work.
+Summary Detail: Success criterion is a new trace/summary pair showing ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` while preserving the existing post-polar field.
+Summary Detail: Record all findings in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log immediately after completion so the supervisory history stays linear.
 Mode: Parity
+Mode Detail: Treat every change through the lens of cross-implementation agreement; no new physics allowed until evidence proves traces line up.
+Mode Detail: Evidence over execution—capture logs, metrics, and diffs so supervisor review can proceed without re-running commands.
 Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 — Phase M instrumentation parity (trace harness + simulator taps)
+Focus Detail: Specifically target the I_before_scaling instrumentation described in plan tasks M1–M3; defer scaling bug fixes until trace output is trustworthy.
 Branch: main (expected)
+Branch Detail: Stay on the shared branch; do not create feature branches for this instrumentation tweak unless conflicts arise during commit.
 Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
+Mapped tests Detail: Collection only this loop—full execution deferred until code paths change beyond instrumentation.
 Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md
+Artifacts Detail: The new directory should include trace logs, harness stdout/stderr, summary.md, metrics.json, collect.log, commands.txt, and sha256.txt; keep the previous galph memo as a reference for before/after comparison.
 Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md §CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M — update the simulator trace so it emits both pre- and post-polarization `I_before_scaling`, then rerun the harness with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` followed by `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_timestamp>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
-If Blocked: Capture stderr, stdout, and intermediate artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/`, note the issue in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003), and halt for supervisor guidance.
+Do Now Detail: Ensure `<new_timestamp>` is unique (UTC ISO8601 without punctuation) and reuse the same value for all generated files so the evidence bundle remains coherent.
+Do Now Detail: After the comparison, open `summary.md` to confirm both the pre-polar and post-polar metrics are recorded and note any residual delta in docs/fix_plan.md.
+If Blocked:
+- Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<timestamp>/attempt_failed/` and dump all logs there (stdout, stderr, partial traces, compare output).
+- Append a short README.md inside the folder summarizing the failure mode, commands executed, and suspected root cause.
+- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt log (CLI-FLAGS-003) with the failure summary and the new artifact path so the supervisor has immediate context.
+- Do not push partial code changes; wait for supervisor guidance once the failure package is prepared.
 Priorities & Rationale:
-- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1 explicitly requires synchronized trace taps before structure-factor debugging can continue.
-- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 section) now identifies the polarization timing mismatch as the first divergence; resolving it keeps attempt history accurate.
-- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md documents the numerical evidence; this run should supersede it with corrected metrics.
-- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation defines `I_term` before polarization; instrumentation must honour that order to maintain parity contracts.
-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

-- Maintaining trace parity avoids wasting time on physics changes when instrumentation is the root cause.
+- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md Phase M1–M3 block on having a trustworthy trace; without this fix the entire scaling parity chain remains stalled.
+- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 entry) was amended this loop to highlight the polarization mismatch; acting immediately keeps plan text and reality aligned.
+- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md contains quantified evidence (C value × polar); a new report should replace its provisional status with verified metrics.
+- specs/spec-a-core.md §Sampling & Accumulation states that `I_term` is the pre-polarization sum, so parity comparisons must occur at that stage to respect the normative contract.
+- Aligning trace taps prevents false positives and ensures subsequent debugging (F_cell, lattice factors, scaling) targets real physics gaps.
+- Updating instrumentation now will make future nb-compare runs cleaner because `compare_scaling_traces.py` will no longer flag I_before errors.
+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

**Summarizing debug note with hypotheses and actions**

I'll organize the final message into clear sections: key findings with file references, two ranked hypotheses with confidence and supporting evidence, and next steps focusing on updating instrumentation and rerunning tests. I'll include relevant paths and line numbers to keep it concise and actionable, closing with suggestions for verifying changes.
[2025-10-08T05:22:00] codex

**Key Findings**
- Logged the `I_before_scaling` discrepancy as instrumentation drift: PyTorch traces recorded the post-polarization value while the C trace reports the pre-polar accumulator, so their ratio equals the C polarization factor (`0.9146397`). Evidence captured in the new memo `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md:1`.  
- Updated the active plan entry so Phase M now explicitly calls for tapping the pre-polar intensity before proceeding (`docs/fix_plan.md:451`).

**Hypotheses**
1. (High confidence) `I_before_scaling` parity fails because the PyTorch trace prints the accumulator after multiplying by the polarization factor, unlike nanoBragg.c. Confirm once `_apply_debug_output` emits both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar`, then rerun the harness/compare pair to verify the pre-polar delta falls to ≤1e-6.  
2. (Moderate confidence) The residual ~0.2 % gap seen after backing out polarization is driven by float32 rounding and tiny lattice-factor drifts; expect it to vanish (or shrink below tolerances) when the comparison switches to the pre-polar tap and, if needed, repeats in float64.

**Next Steps**
1. Implement the instrumentation tweak and refreshed harness run exactly as laid out in `input.md:1` (emit both trace values, capture evidence under a new timestamp, rerun `compare_scaling_traces.py`, and log the attempt).
2. Once the pre-polar metric is green, continue with plan tasks M2/M3: diagnose structure-factor parity and add the regression test before moving on to the nb-compare/command reruns.

Committed & pushed: `SUPERVISOR: CLI-FLAGS-003 instrumentation prep - tests: not run`.

 - Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.

-- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
+- First Divergence (if known): Phase M1 comparison now shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, and **PyTorch `F_cell` resolves correctly (190.27)**. The residual −8.7% delta in `I_before_scaling` is an instrumentation offset: PyTorch logs the value *after* applying the polarization factor, whereas nanoBragg.c prints it *before* polarization.

 3. **Phase N/O readiness** — After scaling passes, regenerate ROI artifacts with `nb-compare` (plan tasks N1–N3) and schedule the supervisor command closure run (O1–O3), capturing metrics + SHA256 manifests under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/`.

+- Resolving this also unblocks documentation updates in Phase M4 (summary + checklist) since the narrative will match collected data.
+- The longer the mismatch persists, the greater the risk that additional attempts misinterpret the data and open unnecessary follow-up tasks.
 How-To Map:
-- Inspect `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py::_apply_debug_output`; locate the block printing `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` and split the logic:
-  - Capture the accumulator before polarization multiplication (clone if needed) and print `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
-  - After polarization is applied, rename the existing print to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so downstream scripts can reference both.
-  - Ensure new tensors respect device/dtype neutrality (use in-graph operations, avoid `.cpu()`/`.item()` on differentiable tensors except when tracing).
-- Update `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` or its config if necessary so it compares the pre-polar metric against the C trace; add the new token to the parser if required.
-- Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` so the emitted log and JSON include both pre- and post-polar fields; keep existing output schema backward compatible (append new keys, do not rename old ones yet).
-- Create a fresh timestamped directory under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/` (use `date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ` for naming) and pre-create placeholder files (`commands.txt`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`) to avoid accidentally overwriting previous evidence.
-- Run the harness command (CPU, float32, c-parity) with the updated code; capture stdout/stderr to `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` inside the new directory for reproducibility.
-- Immediately run `compare_scaling_traces.py` pointing to the C trace and the new PyTorch trace; verify the summary reports a ≤1e-6 relative delta for `I_before_scaling_pre_polar`. Store summary.md, metrics.json (if produced), and the raw diff output in the same directory.
-- After tool runs, execute `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm test discovery still passes; save the output to `collect.log` in the new evidence folder.
-- Update `commands.txt` with the exact commands (including environment variables), append SHA256 checksums to `sha256.txt`, and note the git SHA for reproducibility.
+- Step 0 — Preparation:
+  - Read `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z/galph_debug_20251203.md` so the numerical target (pre-polar value) is clear.
+  - Confirm working tree is clean except for intentional edits; stash or document anything unrelated before proceeding.
+- Step 1 — Simulator instrumentation:
+  - Open `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` and locate `_apply_debug_output`.
+  - Identify the section where `I_total` is accepted and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling` is printed.
+  - Before polarization multiplies the accumulator, insert a tensor clone (on the same device/dtype) and print it using the new label `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar`.
+  - Leave the existing logic in place but rename the current print statement to `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` so post-factor data remains available.
+  - Guard the new prints behind the existing trace conditions; avoid extra branching that could break torch.compile caching.
+- Step 2 — Validation script alignment:
+  - Review `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py`; update token parsing to recognise the `_pre_polar` label while keeping backward compatibility (if the label is absent, fall back to the post-polar value so older logs still work).
+  - Extend the metrics dictionary so `summary.md` and any JSON output include both `pre_polar` and `post_polar` values, making it obvious which stage is compared.
+- Step 3 — Harness update:
+  - Modify `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to capture both values:
+    * Write both to the main log via the simulator trace (already handled after Step 1).
+    * Append the new key/value pair to the per-φ JSON structure so future analyses can see which stage is recorded.
+    * When dumping `metrics.json`, ensure the `I_before_scaling_pre_polar` value is stored separately from the post-polar number.
+- Step 4 — Evidence directory setup:
+  - Create a new directory named `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`.
+  - Inside the directory, touch placeholder files: `commands.txt`, `summary.md`, `metrics.json`, `sha256.txt`, `harness_stdout.log`, `harness_stderr.log`, `collect.log`.
+  - Document the intended contents at the top of `commands.txt` so the directory remains self-describing.
+- Step 5 — Harness execution:
+  - Run `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --config supervisor --device cpu --dtype float32 --phi-mode c-parity --out <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log` with `<dir>` replaced by the new path.
+  - Redirect stdout and stderr into `harness_stdout.log` and `harness_stderr.log` to capture warnings.
+  - Verify the generated trace now contains both `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_pre_polar` and `TRACE_PY: I_before_scaling_post_polar` entries.
+- Step 6 — Trace comparison:
+  - Execute `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py --c reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log --py <dir>/trace_py_scaling_cpu.log --out <dir>/summary.md --tolerance 1e-6`.
+  - Inspect the resulting `summary.md` to confirm the pre-polar delta is ≤1e-6 relative; highlight both pre and post values in the markdown for clarity.
+  - If the comparison emits auxiliary files (JSON, diff text), store them alongside the summary.
+- Step 7 — Test discovery & documentation:
+  - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` and append the console output to `<dir>/collect.log`.
+  - Update `commands.txt` with every command executed (in chronological order) including environment variables and working directories.
+  - Record the current git SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD >> sha256.txt` (label the entry so it is distinguishable from file hashes).
+- Step 8 — Checksums & wrap-up:
+  - From inside `<dir>`, run `shasum -a 256 * > sha256.txt` (append mode) so each artifact is fingerprinted.
+  - Re-open `summary.md` and add a brief note referencing the polarization adjustment and linking back to the older report for context.
+  - Stage the new directory for commit once all manual inspections are complete.
 Pitfalls To Avoid:
-- Do not delete or rename existing directories under `reports/.../scaling_validation/`; append a new timestamp instead.
-- Keep the instrumentation vectorized; avoid inserting per-φ Python loops or conditionals that would break batching.
-- Ensure new trace strings retain the `TRACE_PY:` prefix so downstream scripts do not miss them.
-- Avoid `.item()` on tensors that participate in gradients; only use `.item()` for debug prints outside the differentiable path.
-- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—any new tensors should be created with `torch.as_tensor` or `type_as` on the target device.
-- Remember the Protected Assets rule: files referenced in `docs/index.md` must not be moved or removed.
-- Do not run the full pytest suite in this loop; limit execution to the collect-only command listed above.
-- When generating SHA256 checksums, run them from the new directory to avoid including stale files.
-- Keep `trace_harness.py` CLI backwards compatible; default behavior should still emit spec-mode traces without the new flag.
-- Double-check that compare_scaling_traces reads the pre-polar key; add defensive logging if necessary to avoid silent mismatches.
+- Never overwrite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T044933Z`; it remains a historical reference for Attempt #137.
+- Avoid adding Python-side loops or branching that reintroduce per-φ iteration—vectorization must stay intact for performance and correctness.
+- Keep all new trace labels prefixed with `TRACE_PY:` and use snake_case consistent with existing instrumentation.
+- Do not coerce tensors to CPU just for printing; rely on `.item()` sparingly and only in non-differentiable debug paths.
+- Maintain dtype/device neutrality by constructing helper tensors with `torch.as_tensor(..., device=existing.device, dtype=existing.dtype)`.
+- Respect Protected Asset policy: confirm every file you touch is absent from `docs/index.md` before moving or renaming it.
+- Limit test execution to the collect-only selector; running the full suite would violate supervisor guidance for this loop.
+- Generate SHA256 checksums from within the new directory to avoid mixing hashes from previous attempts.
+- Preserve CLI compatibility in `trace_harness.py`; new arguments must be optional and default to previous behaviour.
+- Confirm `compare_scaling_traces.py` handles the new key before committing; add explicit assertion or warning if the pre-polar label is missing.
+- Watch for interaction with torch.compile caching—if new tensors break graph capture, add explanatory comments per PERF plan guidelines.
+- Keep code comments succinct but informative, referencing plan IDs where appropriate.
+- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history after the run, citing the new artifact directory and summarising the pre/post polar deltas.
+- Avoid committing directly from a dirty worktree; run `git status` frequently and stage only intentional files.
+- Re-run the harness if the first pass accidentally uses an existing timestamp—each attempt must have its own directory for traceability.

+Next Up Detail: When moving to M2, reuse the updated harness to capture per-φ F_cell/F_latt contributions so structure-factor mismatches can be isolated quickly.
