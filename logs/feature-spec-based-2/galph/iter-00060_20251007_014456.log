review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.

<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor evidence mode (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Supervisor Evidence Gate (internal-only): No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Mode flags: Mode flags are combinable and refine execution; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

### Crystal Parameters

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot addendum (2025-10-06T17:59 replayed 2025-11-09): Re-running Phase L1 with `Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin` shows the cache stores 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than the 173,166 expected from header ranges) and that reflections shift by Δk≈+10–12 / Δl≈−2…−8 relative to HKL indices. Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
- Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Gap recap (2025-11-05): Manual inspection of `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py` shows the cross-product rescale still runs even when MOSFLM reciprocal vectors are supplied (lines 681-705), and `BeamConfig.polarization_factor` defaults to 1.0, so scaling remains off despite SAMPLE pivot parity.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-06): Traces (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) show the SAMPLE pivot fix leaves residual close-distance deltas (~2.8 µm), which push the fractional Miller index from 2.0012 (C) to 1.9993 (PyTorch). Those 0.002 shifts around integer values amplify sincg results (F_latt_b ≈ +21.6%). Need dtype diagnostics to confirm float32 rounding vs geometry formula drift before coding a fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-07): dtype sweep (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/dtype_sweep/`) rules out precision and exposes a φ-grid mismatch—PyTorch logs `k≈1.9997` (φ=0°) while C logs `k≈1.9928` (φ=0.09°). Next action: capture per-φ traces to align sampling before rerunning normalization tests.
- Diagnostic note (2025-11-08 galph audit): `scripts/trace_per_phi.py` currently subtracts `pix0_vector` from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`, yielding plane-relative vectors instead of sample-to-pixel paths. Fix this double subtraction in the Phase K3f PyTorch harness before recording new parity traces.
- Gap confirmation (2025-11-08 trace diff): Phase K3f base-lattice traces show PyTorch keeps the placeholder unit cell volume (`V≈1 Å^3`) when MOSFLM vectors are supplied, so `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` fails to rescale the real vectors. C multiplies `b*×c*` by `V_cell≈2.4682×10^4 Å^3` before converting to meters, yielding |a|≈26.75 Å; PyTorch leaves |a|≈5.8×10^3 Å, which in turn inflates h/k/l by ≈6 units. Fix requires mirroring the MOSFLM derivation pipeline in `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` (see `specs/spec-a-core.md` Geometry + `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` 3135-3210).
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-08 evening): Commit 46ba36b implements the MOSFLM rescale path and new regression test `TestMOSFLMCellVectors::test_mosflm_cell_vectors` passes (see `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/post_fix/cell_tensors_py.txt`). Base-lattice summary now records the fix; remaining blocker is Phase K3g3 to rerun scaling evidence and refresh nb-compare/pytest artifacts.

[2025-10-07T01:45:42] bash -lc "sed -n '1,200p' plans/active/vectorization.md" succeeded in 705ms:
## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.
- Gap Snapshot (2025-11-09): Phase A remains untouched; no artifacts exist under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, so Ralph must prioritise A1–A3 baseline capture before any implementation edits. docs/fix_plan.md item VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 lists these as the gating next actions.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-10-06 ralph update → 2025-11-09 galph sync):
  1. Phase L1b ✅ — Layout analysis complete (Attempt #52). `scripts/validation/analyze_fdump_layout.py` + `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/layout_analysis.md` document that nanoBragg writes `(h_range+2)×(k_range+2)×(l_range+2)` voxels via the `for(h0=0; h0<=h_range; h0++)` loops, leaving 9,534 zero-padded entries per cache.
  2. Phase L1c ✅ — (Attempt #53) Updated PyTorch HKL cache IO (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/hkl.py::read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) to match C padding layout exactly. Added regression test `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` achieving max |ΔF| = 0.0 (perfect parity). Fixed h_range calculation to C-style (h_max - h_min + 1), padded writes to (range+1)³, trimmed reads to range³.
  3. Phase L1d — Regenerate Fdump via C (timestamped cache under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`), rerun `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py`, and require max |ΔF| ≤ 1e-6 with zero mismatches before advancing to Phase L2 scaling traces.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

      - **Convention handling confirmed:** TRACE_PY shows `detector_convention=CUSTOM`, verifying custom vector presence correctly triggers CUSTOM mode and SAMPLE pivot enforcement.
      - **Beam center consistency:** Fclose/Sclose match exactly (0.0 delta), confirming CLI parsing and mm→m conversion are correct.
      - **Geometry stability:** close_distance delta of 2.84 μm and r_factor delta of 6.8e-8 demonstrate numerical stability across the detector geometry pipeline.
      - **No unit regressions:** All trace values in meters (as required by detector hybrid unit system); no millimeter/Angstrom confusion.
      - **Phase H6g exit criteria met:** |Δpix0| = 2.85 μm << 50 μm threshold; evidence artifacts archived; ready for Phase K2.
    Next Actions: **Phase K2 required** — With pix0 parity confirmed, regenerate scaling-chain analysis with corrected SAMPLE pivot traces. Execute Phase K2 checklist from `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`: (1) rerun PyTorch trace harness for pixel (1039,685) with final geometry, (2) diff F_latt components against C baseline, (3) update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` with post-H6 comparison, (4) archive refreshed traces under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/`, (5) proceed to Phase K3 regression test once F_latt parity is restored.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #42 (ralph loop) — Result: **EVIDENCE COMPLETE** (Phase K2/K2b). **Critical finding: MOSFLM rescaling is NOT the root cause of F_latt_b error.**
    Metrics: Evidence-only loop (per supervisor directive). Scaling ratios: F_latt_b C=38.63 vs Py=46.98 (21.6% error), polar C=0.913 vs Py=1.0 (9.6% error), I_final C=446 vs Py=497 (11.4% error). MOSFLM lattice vector analysis reveals perfect magnitude match (|b|_C = |b|_Py = 31.310 Å), ruling out rescale hypothesis.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log` - Fresh PyTorch trace for pixel (1039, 685) with SAMPLE pivot

**Reviewing recent debugging attempts and hypotheses**

I'm looking over the latest debugging efforts and plan to check the repo status to form 1-3 hypotheses about the scaling mismatch issue. It seems important to confirm completion of intermediate steps like L1d and review recent fix attempts (#52, #53) to understand the current state before further troubleshooting.

Fixed h_range calculation to C-style (h_max - h_min + 1), padded writes to (range+1)³, trimmed reads to range³.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #5 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase D3 evidence). Executed intensity gap analysis per supervisor directive.
    Observations/Hypotheses: CLI successfully parsed all flags including `-beam_vector`, `-pix0_vector_mm`, `-convention CUSTOM` inputs, but `Detector.__init__` ignores `custom_beam_vector` from config and falls back to convention defaults. This is the second geometry gap alongside the pix0 transform issue documented in Attempt #5 (Phase E). Running the evidence harness also created a duplicate copy of the structure-factor file (`scaled.hkl.1`, identical to `scaled.hkl`) in the repo root; treat it as an artefact that needs removal during the upcoming implementation pass so repo hygiene stays intact.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #50 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase L1 HKL ingestion evidence complete). **Critical discrepancy: PyTorch and C load HKL/Fdump data with significant numerical differences (max |ΔF|=522 electrons, 99k mismatched voxels), but investigation reveals this is NOT a fundamental ingestion bug.**
  * [2025-11-09] Attempt #51 (galph) — Result: **EVIDENCE UPDATE** (Phase L1a rerun). Regenerated the cache (`Fdump_scaled_20251006175946.bin`, size 1,461,622 bytes) via the supervisor command (ROI-trimmed) and re-executed `compare_structure_factors.py`. Metrics remain max |ΔF|=5.22e2, RMS=5.10e1, mismatches=99,209, but inspection shows the binary encodes 182,700 doubles (≈9,534 more than header ranges) and consistent index shifts (Δk≈+10–12, Δl≈−2…−8). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/c_fdump_20251006175946.log`, `run_20251006175946.log`, and the new cache alongside the original evidence. Recommended action: Phase L1b must reconcile C's dump layout with PyTorch IO before resuming scaling traces.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #52 (ralph) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L1b complete). **Fdump layout fully characterized; C off-by-one allocation confirmed.**
  * [2025-10-17] Attempt #53 (ralph) — Result: **SUCCESS** (Phase L1c complete). **HKL/Fdump IO aligned with C binary format; perfect roundtrip parity achieved.**

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L1c: Fix HKL/Fdump padding to match C binary format
    
    Implements Phase L1c of CLI-FLAGS-003 plan to align HKL cache IO with
    nanoBragg C semantics.
    
    **Problem:** PyTorch calculated h_range = h_max - h_min (span) while C
    uses h_range = h_max - h_min + 1 (count of values). This caused C to
    write (h_range+1)³ doubles (with padding) while PyTorch expected h_range³.
    
    **Root Cause:** C code (nanoBragg.c:2405) defines ranges as value counts:
      h_range = h_max - h_min + 1
    Then allocates (h_range+1)³ and writes all elements including padding.
    
    **Fix:**
    - `read_hkl_file()`: Changed h_range calculation to C-style (+1)
    - `read_fdump()`: Read padded (h_range+1)³, trim to h_range³

**Evaluating and updating project plan**

I’m reviewing the current multi-phase plan for the CLI noise project to see if it needs updates or restructuring to incorporate new tasks like L1d and detailed phase tracking. I want to make sure the plan covers all recent contexts and instructions without regressions, so I’ll check the Phase L section thoroughly before deciding whether to update or create a new plan.

The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

**Preparing to update plan for CLI parity**

I see the current plan mistakenly shows L1c as incomplete, so I need to mark it done and likely add new tasks for L1d and CLI parity. Before updating, I want to identify the focus issue as CLI parity and gather relevant docs like spec-a-cli and detector architecture to ground the plan changes thoughtfully. I'll read those to justify the updates properly.

  2. Phase L1c ✅ — (Attempt #53) Updated PyTorch HKL cache IO (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/hkl.py::read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) to match C padding layout exactly. Added regression test `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` achieving max |ΔF| = 0.0 (perfect parity). Fixed h_range calculation to C-style (h_max - h_min + 1), padded writes to (range+1)³, trimmed reads to range³.
  3. Phase L1d — Regenerate Fdump via C (timestamped cache under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`), rerun `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py`, and require max |ΔF| ≤ 1e-6 with zero mismatches before advancing to Phase L2 scaling traces.

  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - **High correlation (0.998) indicates pattern matches:** Shapes and positions correct, magnitudes catastrophically wrong
      - **Intensity ratio 121,250×:** PyTorch raw values ~124,538× higher than C after normalization
      - **Both implementations completed without errors:** Detector geometry, pix0 vectors, convention selection all agree
      - **Hypotheses for debugging loop:**
        1. Missing division by `steps = sources × mosaic × phisteps × oversample²` (C: steps=10 confirmed)
        2. Missing scaling by r_e² (classical electron radius = 2.818×10⁻¹⁵ m; r_e² = 7.94×10⁻³⁰ m²)
        3. Incorrect fluence calculation (C: 1e24 photons/m², PyTorch: verify derivation from flux/exposure/beamsize)

[2025-10-07T01:47:36] bash -lc "sed -n '440,470p' docs/fix_plan.md" succeeded in 692ms:
- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
- Attempts History: None — new item.
- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

## [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm
- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.
- Next Actions (2025-10-06 ralph update → 2025-11-09 galph sync):
  1. Phase L1b ✅ — Layout analysis complete (Attempt #52). `scripts/validation/analyze_fdump_layout.py` + `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/layout_analysis.md` document that nanoBragg writes `(h_range+2)×(k_range+2)×(l_range+2)` voxels via the `for(h0=0; h0<=h_range; h0++)` loops, leaving 9,534 zero-padded entries per cache.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

**Preparing analysis and input generation**

I’m organizing hypotheses about the scaling mismatch issue based on past fixes and evidence, proposing next steps to verify these ideas. I’m also gathering details to create an input.md document that highlights the focus issue CLI-FLAGS-003 and includes instructions for running a targeted parity script with exact commands and references. Before finalizing, I need to verify the script’s usage to ensure accurate command-line arguments.

   2. Phase L1c ✅ — (Attempt #53) Updated PyTorch HKL cache IO (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/hkl.py::read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) to match C padding layout exactly. Added regression test `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` achieving max |ΔF| = 0.0 (perfect parity). Fixed h_range calculation to C-style (h_max - h_min + 1), padded writes to (range+1)³, trimmed reads to range³.
   3. Phase L1d — Regenerate Fdump via C (timestamped cache under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`), rerun `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py`, and require max |ΔF| ≤ 1e-6 with zero mismatches before advancing to Phase L2 scaling traces.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

**Preparing detailed execution instructions**

I’m organizing how to instruct the user to run a specific Python script with updated output paths including timestamps. I’m also considering whether to mention environment variables like `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC`, what test to reference for validation, and how to specify the branch context by checking the current git branch. I want to balance thoroughness with clarity, especially around test running recommendations.

 - First Divergence (if known): Phase K3e evidence reveals a **fundamental lattice/geometry mismatch**, not a φ-grid offset. C reports `k_frac≈−3.857` across all φ steps while PyTorch reports `k_frac≈−9.899` (Δk≈6.04 at φ=0°). This 6-unit discrepancy indicates the base reciprocal lattice vectors or scattering geometry differ before any φ rotation is applied.

If Blocked: Capture the blocking command output under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/attempt_blocked.log and note the failure in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts before escalating.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:1 — CLI spec mandates C↔Py structure-factor parity before flag acceptance is complete.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:5 — Ensures pix0/pivot context used when interpreting parity deltas.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:120 — Parallel validation matrix requires targeted parity checks before full nb-compare reruns.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:218 — L1d exit criteria define the evidence bundle we must collect this loop.

- Then run the Do Now command to produce summary and metrics; keep outputs under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/.
- Validate mapped pytest node with "'`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` (collection only under supervisor evidence gate).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not skip setting KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK before any torch import or CLI call.
- No edits outside planning/docs; production code stays untouched this loop.
- Preserve device/dtype neutrality when running scripts (use cpu by default, no implicit `.cpu()` copies).
- Avoid overwriting prior parity artefacts; use new timestamped filenames.
- Remember Protected Assets rule — never move or delete files referenced in docs/index.md.
- Do not run full pytest suite; stick to targeted collection/tests per instructions.
- Keep nb-compare unused until HKL parity metrics clear the 1e-6 threshold.
- Ensure reports/ paths exist before writing artefacts to avoid accidental repo clutter.
- No torch.compile caches cleared during evidence-only loops.
- Record any deviations in docs/fix_plan.md Attempts immediately.

**Preparing final analysis and commit steps**

I’m organizing hypotheses about the lattice mismatch and next inspection points before I finalize the update. I’ll check the crystal model file to confirm if the rules for recalculating reciprocal vectors are applied, aiming to clarify the intensity gap, then update memory and commit everything per the instructions.

**Analyzing intensity discrepancy hypotheses**

I'm considering possible reasons for the unresolved 6-unit delta despite seemingly correct code. I plan to verify Fdump parity with a parity script and then check if differences in phi sampling or the sincg function's math constants might explain the residual gap. I'll investigate the sincg implementation next.

- Follow-up for Ralph: execute K3e per memo, produce per-φ JSON/MD logs, then we can plan the φ sampling fix (K3f) next loop.

## 2025-11-07 (galph loop — K3f baseline instrumentation)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed latest Attempt logs and vectorization backlog.
- Deep dive confirmed long-term Goal #1 still blocked by Δk≈6 gap (CLI-FLAGS-003); F_latt parity depends on capturing base lattice & scattering traces before φ rotation.
- Refreshed `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase K3f with checklist K3f1–K3f4 (instrument C/Py, diff traces, document root cause) and synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to match.
- Issued new Evidence-phase input.md directing Ralph to execute K3f1 (C trace run) and stage matching PyTorch harness output under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/`.
- Next Ralph steps: add TRACE_C_BASE instrumentation, run the supervisor command into `base_lattice/c_trace.log`, extend the Py harness for `TRACE_PY_BASE`, and prep for K3f3 diff once both logs exist.

## 2025-11-08 (galph loop — K3f harness correction)
- `git pull --rebase` clean; read docs/index.md, spec shards, arch.md, config map, debugging SOP, testing strategy, fix_plan, vectorization plan.
- Reviewed Ralph’s recent evidence commits (271e2b6, 2467064): instrumentation valuable but per-φ script subtracts `pix0_vector` from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`, yielding plane-relative vectors and explaining the 6-unit Δk seen in Attempt #45.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` (K3f context + K3f2 guidance) and `docs/fix_plan.md` next actions to require sample-to-pixel vectors with no double subtraction before new traces are captured.
- Chosen focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase K3f base-lattice parity. Hypotheses recorded (primary: trace harness bug; secondary: confirm real/reciprocal vectors + scattering after harness fix). Next confirming step: capture corrected C/Py base traces per plan.
- Authored Evidence-phase `input.md` directing Ralph to instrument `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c`, rebuild, run the supervisor CLI command, and add a corrected PyTorch harness under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/base_lattice/` with comparison tooling.
- No additional plan work required for vectorization yet; Phase A still pending once CLI parity unblocks bandwidth.

## 2025-11-08 (galph loop — MOSFLM rescale implementation prep)
- Verified base-lattice traces: PyTorch keeps placeholder `V≈1 Å^3` when MOSFLM A* is present, giving |a|≈5.8×10^3 Å and Δh≈6; C rescales with `V_cell≈2.4682×10^4 Å^3` before metric duality.
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase K3f (rows marked `[D]`) and added Phase K3g tasks for implementing the MOSFLM rescale pipeline + regression coverage; docs/fix_plan Next Actions now call out K3g1–K3g3.

- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L snapshot (L1c → [D], new note on Attempt #53) and synced `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions to show L1c completion; left L1d as the active blocker.

Added regression test `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` achieving max |ΔF| = 0.0 (perfect parity). Fixed h_range calculation to C-style (h_max - h_min + 1), padded writes to (range+1)³, trimmed reads to range³.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.

**Summarizing final response plan**
[2025-10-07T01:50:21] codex

Updated CLI parity planning docs so Ralph has an accurate roadmap: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:9` now records L1c completion and `docs/fix_plan.md:455` lists L1d as the remaining blocker; new supervisor memo in `input.md` directs the L1d rerun.

Debugging hypotheses (CLI-FLAGS-003):
- H1 (high confidence): HKL parity should now pass once L1d reruns, since Attempt #53 fixed the padding layout; confirm via `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py` with the freshly regenerated C cache (next step spelled out in input.md). Evidence: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:225`, `docs/fix_plan.md:455`.
- H2 (medium): If Δk≈6 persists after L1d, the per-φ traces likely still reflect reciprocal-basis drift; capture new traces per Phase K3f/K3g to isolate the misalignment (artifacts referenced in plan Phase K3f).
- H3 (medium-low): Remaining intensity gap may stem from sincg normalization ordering; only investigate once hypotheses 1–2 are cleared.

Coin flip came up heads: reviewed Ralph’s last two commits (`4e73062`, `572217b`)—evidence loops were productive, HKL padding fix landed cleanly, no regressions to report.

Ralph’s immediate next action is in `input.md`: regenerate the C Fdump cache with the supervisor command, run `compare_structure_factors.py` to produce `summary_20251109.md` and `metrics_20251109.json`, and log the attempt so Phase L2 scaling work can resume.

Use this dataset to reverse-engineer the C layout before touching PyTorch HKL IO.
 - Gap insight (2025-10-31): Scaling evidence shows MOSFLM matrix runs still rescale real vectors using formula lengths; C skips that step unless `-cell` is provided, so PyTorch must gate the `vector_rescale` analogue when `mosflm_a_star` is set. The same trace confirms the polarization Kahn factor should default to 0.0 (C’s `polarization`), not 1.0, so BeamConfig defaults need to be realigned before Phase L.
 - Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.

Artefacts live under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/hkl_parity/`. |

Confirmed nanoBragg writes `(h_range+2)×(k_range+2)×(l_range+2)` voxels via `for(h0=0; h0<=h_range; h0++)` loops (see `nanoBragg.c:2400-2486`), leaving 9,534 zero-padded entries. PyTorch reader must drop the padded plane per axis. |
-| L1c | Align PyTorch HKL cache reader/writer with confirmed layout | [ ] | Update `read_fdump()` / `write_fdump()` and add regression coverage ensuring `read_hkl_file()` ≡ `read_fdump()` for `scaled.hkl`. Cite the C reference per Rule #11 and update tests (`tests/test_cli_scaling.py` or new unit). |
+| L1c | Align PyTorch HKL cache reader/writer with confirmed layout | [D] | ✅ Attempt #53 (2025-10-17): Updated `src/nanobrag_torch/io/hkl.py` to honour `(range+1)` padding, added C-code docstring quotes per Rule #11, and introduced `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip` (max |ΔF| = 0.0, mismatches = 0). |
 | L1d | Re-run parity script after fixes and update artefacts | [ ] | Regenerate the cache via C, rerun `scripts/validation/compare_structure_factors.py`, and refresh `summary.md` + `metrics_*.json`. Log results in docs/fix_plan.md and ensure Phase L2 prerequisites (scaling traces) now rest on matching structure factors. |
