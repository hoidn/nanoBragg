review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, Do Now SHALL be evidence‑only: run the authoritative reference reproduction commands and capture the required artifacts; at most run the project’s test discovery (no execution). Do not include runnable tests.

Validation Preflight (tests): Before listing any test file/identifier in Do Now, validate that it resolves via the project’s documented test discovery; if validation fails, omit tests and note “(none — evidence‑only this loop)” and add a TODO in docs/fix_plan.md documenting the missing mapping.

Human Summary (input.md header): Prepend a short summary block with the following lines (validated where applicable):
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>

Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it relate to? 
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? if not, fix. things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, this should be addressed. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
- Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
- Header: timestamp, current commit hash (short), author “galph”, and Active Focus summary.
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the authoritative pytest command/env. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

Rules:
- Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
- If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Document version: 1.0 (aligned with specs/spec-a.md)
Target spec: specs/spec-a.md (single-file normative spec)
Implementation target: Python (>=3.11) + PyTorch (float32 default). Type blocks may use TypeScript-style for clarity; implement with Python dataclasses and torch tensors.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-17 refresh): Phase F1/F2 delivered custom beam-vector wiring and the full CUSTOM pix0 transform, with validation artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f*/`. The parity rerun (F3) remains outstanding, and C traces continue to show the MOSFLM orientation missing because `-mat` still collapses to canonical vectors. Polarization (C Kahn ≈0.913 vs PyTorch 1.0) stays deferred until geometry parity lands.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Current harness injects the custom beam vector manually; CLI parity requires native wiring.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references).

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py` (create minimal harness if missing) to capture CPU timings for 256² and 512² detectors; record outputs in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v` plus a microbenchmark (`python scripts/benchmarks/sample_absorption_baseline.py`) so we have pre-refactor timings; store under `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

**Verifying custom beam vector handling**

I'm checking that when a beam vector override exists, it correctly sets `pix0_vector` as a tensor on the right device and dtype. I want to confirm CLI hooking and identify any gaps, especially regarding orientation and matrix parity in the plan. I'll review documentation and previous fixes in `docs/fix_plan` and `plans/active/` to spot what remains undone, focusing on `-nonoise` behavior and Phase F3 status using a rg search.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A/B/C2/D3/E/F1/F2 ✅; Phase F3 parity + Phases G–H pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass. (3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces. (4) Once geometry parity holds, execute Phase H polarization alignment and clean up residual artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-05] Phase A Complete — Tasks A1-A3 executed per plan.
    Metrics: C reference behavior captured for both flags via parallel command execution.
    Artifacts:
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_nonoise.log` - C run WITH -nonoise

      - **Key finding:** C code applies CUSTOM convention transformation to pix0_vector AFTER override

- Priority: High
- Status: in_planning (Phase A evidence outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions:
  1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A1–A3 to capture baseline pytest logs and timing snippets under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` and record Attempt #1 in this entry.
  2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
  3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * (pending) — Capture Phase A baseline artifacts and update this log.
- Risks/Assumptions: Must maintain differentiability (no `.item()`, no `torch.linspace` with tensor bounds), preserve device/dtype neutrality (CPU/CUDA parity), and obey Protected Assets rule (all new scripts under `scripts/benchmarks/`). Large tensor indexing may increase memory pressure; ensure ROI caching still works.
- Exit Criteria (quote thresholds from spec):
  * specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 tricubic acceptance tests run without warnings and match C parity within documented tolerances (corr≥0.9995, ≤1e-12 structural duality where applicable).

## Phase F2 Completion Report: CUSTOM pix0 Transform Implementation
Date: 2025-10-05
Owner: ralph

### Summary
Successfully implemented the CUSTOM pix0 transform to match C-code behavior (nanoBragg.c:1736-1846).
Key discovery: The `-twotheta` flag (even when 0) sets detector_pivot = SAMPLE in C code (line 786),
causing pix0 override to be IGNORED in favor of calculated values from beam centers.

### Root Cause Analysis
The C-PyTorch pix0 discrepancy was caused by two issues:
1. **Missing pivot override**: CLI parser didn't set SAMPLE pivot when `-twotheta` provided
2. **Convention-specific offsets**: CUSTOM mode incorrectly applied MOSFLM +0.5 pixel offset to beam centers

### Implementation Changes

#### 1. CLI Parser (src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py)
- **Line 136**: Changed `-twotheta` default from 0.0 to None to detect explicit provision
- **Lines 486-488**: Added pivot override logic: `if args.twotheta is not None: pivot = 'SAMPLE'`
- **Line 530**: Fill in twotheta default after pivot logic: `args.twotheta if args.twotheta is not None else 0.0`

    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - CLI parser already stored `-beam_vector` in config; implementation gap was only in DetectorConfig → Detector threading
      - Property implementation preserves differentiability (uses `torch.tensor()` with explicit device/dtype, no detach/item calls)
      - Device/dtype neutrality maintained via `.to()` coercion matching detector's device/dtype
      - Tests running at 77% with no new failures related to beam_vector changes (pre-existing failures unrelated)
    Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase F2 to port CUSTOM pix0 transformation logic from C; (2) Re-run the Phase F1 validation snippet so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/beam_vector_after_fix.txt` captures the tensor dump (current file is empty); (3) Run Phase F3 parity smoke test after F2; (4) Continue to Phase G for crystal orientation fix.
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #11 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase F2 complete). **CUSTOM pix0 transformation implemented.**
    Metrics: Tests passed 10/10 (pix0 CLI tests), 30/30 (detector geometry tests). pix0_override now properly integrated - override used but r_factor/close_distance still calculated from rotated detector normal.
    Artifacts:
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:391-402` - Converted pix0_override to tensor without early return
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:520-527` - BEAM pivot uses override if provided, else calculates
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:600-603` - SAMPLE pivot uses override if provided, else calculates
      - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:605-613` - Derive close_distance from pix0_vector when override provided
      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_validation.txt` - Validation report showing r_factor=0.99999, close_distance=0.2313m
    Observations/Hypotheses:
      - Removed early return at line 407 that bypassed all pivot/rotation/r-factor logic
      - pix0_override now treated as final pix0 value but r_factor/close_distance still derived
      - close_distance calculated via `dot(pix0_vector, odet_vec)` matching C code (nanoBragg.c:1846)
      - r_factor properly calculated from rotated detector normal (odet_rotated)
      - All existing tests pass including pix0 CLI flags and detector geometry tests

**Reconciling conflicting updates**

I'm noticing mixed signals about the F2 transform status—some notes say it's done but not active, while recent reports mention reorganization efforts possibly downgrading it. It looks like the fix_plan might be outdated and not synced with the latest attempts, so I need to dive into `detector.py` around lines 490-540 to verify the current logic and figure out what really changed and what still needs updating.

    [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F2: Implement CUSTOM pix0 transform + pivot fix
    
    Implements CUSTOM pix0 transform per nanoBragg.c:1736-1846 to achieve parity
    with C reference. Key discovery: `-twotheta` flag sets SAMPLE pivot even when
    value is 0, causing pix0_override to be ignored in favor of beam center calculation.
    
    Changes:
    - CLI: Set SAMPLE pivot when `-twotheta` provided (C line 786 behavior)
    - CLI: Changed `-twotheta` default to None to detect explicit provision
    - Detector: Added CUSTOM convention support in SAMPLE pivot branch
    - Detector: Fixed Fclose/Sclose to NOT apply +0.5 offset for CUSTOM mode
    - Detector: Removed incorrect pix0_override direct assignment in SAMPLE pivot
    - Detector: Always recalculate close_distance from pix0 (C line 1846)
    - Tests: Updated override tests to match C recalculation behavior

**Reviewing and updating plan with orientation focus**

I’m checking commit changes and realizing the plan file needs updates to mark F2 as done and clarify F3’s pending status, especially around orientation and pivot logic. The plan might need more detail on replicating orientation tasks, so I’ll look into `crystal.py` in the models to understand how orientation is handled before adjusting the plan accordingly.

**Analyzing gradient handling for close_distance**

I’m inspecting how `close_distance` manages gradients, especially since `.item()` strips gradients and may break differentiable pipelines.

**Planning updates for task statuses and bug notes**

I'm organizing updates to the active plan file to reflect that F2 is done with caution due to a newly found gradient break bug involving `close_distance.item()`, and marking F3 as blocked pending orientation to prevent confusion; I'll add notes to highlight this regression risk and adjust Next Actions accordingly.

**Planning test commands and debugging for orientation**

I’m sorting out which tests to include for orientation, noticing no direct pyro tests exist yet, so I’ll point to existing CLI flag tests and the parity harness commands instead. I’m also gearing up to include debugging hypotheses as orientation involves a parity issue and prepping artifact paths and commands for the implementation phase.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase F2 CUSTOM pix0 transform + parity rerun prep

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py -k pix0 -v

If Blocked: Capture a fresh C/PyTorch parallel trace for the supervisor command, store it as reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/pix0_transform_blocked.md, and note the exact divergence before touching code again.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:74-79 — Phase F2 remains [P]; we must mirror nanoBragg.c CUSTOM math (Fclose/Sclose, rotations, distance recompute) before parity can move forward.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448-458 — Fix-plan next actions now explicitly demand F2 refit and fresh parity evidence; failing to follow breaks our coordination loop.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:35-120 — This section defines pivot-specific pix0 flows and coordinate conventions; implementation must align exactly to satisfy Core Rules 12–15.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:1733-1849 — The C reference shows the precise order of operations (ratio, close_distance, rotations, pix0 logging) we are missing; use it as the ground truth.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Attempt #12 shows correlation ≈−5e-06 and 116× intensity ratio; we must improve on that artifact and archive the follow-up run.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:25-92 — Authoritative commands + trace-first debugging reminders; keep AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC exported for every run.

How-To Map:
- Export NB_C_BIN first: `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` to guarantee we hit the instrumented C binary when reproducing traces.
- Reproduce the C baseline using the full supervisor command (stored in docs/fix_plan.md and prompts/supervisor.md); capture stdout/stderr into reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/c_baseline.log and copy DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR into the same directory.

   440	- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-15):
   441	  * Update `parse_and_validate_args` (and any helper that constructs `CrystalConfig`) to thread the parsed dtype/device into HKL/Fdump loaders so CLI `-dtype` honours float64 from the start.
   442	  * Add a regression test (e.g., `tests/test_cli_dtype.py`) that invokes the parser with `-dtype float64` and asserts `config['hkl_data'][0].dtype == torch.float64`, covering both HKL and Fdump paths.
   443	  * Re-run AT-IO-003 and the CLI smoke (help + minimal render) to ensure no regressions, capturing logs under `reports/DTYPE-CLI/<date>/`.
   444	- Attempts History: None — new item.
   445	- Risks/Assumptions: Ensure `write_fdump` continues to emit float64 on disk (spec requirement) while the in-memory tensor honours caller dtype; watch for latent callers that relied on the old float64 default during plan DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 migration.
   446	- Exit Criteria: CLI runs with `-dtype float64` produce double-precision HKL/Fdump tensors end-to-end, regression test passes, and existing dtype-sensitive tests (AT-IO-003, CLI smoke, gradchecks) remain green.

   453	- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`

   455	  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   456	  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
   457	- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
   458	- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done.

(3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces.

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G orientation + detector gradient hygiene
Summary: Implement Phase G orientation wiring and restore differentiable close_distance
Phase: Implementation
Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G — MOSFLM matrix orientation
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase G1) — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v

If Blocked: Capture C & PyTorch crystal-vector traces for the supervisor command at pixel (1039,685); save diff as reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/orientation_blocked_trace.md and add the divergence summary to docs/fix_plan.md Attempts.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:80 — Phase G tasks (G1–G3) are the remaining blockers before parity rerun; orientation from -mat must persist through the PyTorch pipeline.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Fix-plan next actions now point at MOSFLM A* retention and the new close_distance tensor regression; we must address both before progressing to Phase H.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:150 — Orientation handling expects reciprocal vectors to flow without rebuilding canonical triads; reuse this guidance while threading MOSFLM data.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:22 — Config parity requires mapping MOSFLM matrix inputs directly; follow this mapping when storing A* vectors on the CLI side.
- scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py:1 — Parallel-trace harness is required to verify orientation parity; keep it ready for Phase G3 validation.

How-To Map:
- Export env vars first: "'`export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` and `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; use `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` on every Python or pytest command.
- G1: In `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py`, after `read_mosflm_matrix`, stash the Å⁻¹ reciprocal vectors on `config['"'a_star']"'`, `config['"'b_star']"'`, `config['"'c_star']"'` (tensors or numpy arrays promoted to tensors later). Record the decision path in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/config_notes.md.
- G2: Extend `CrystalConfig`/`Crystal` to accept optional reciprocal vectors; preserve Core Rules 12–13 (misset pipeline + metric duality). Use C reference `nanoBragg.c:3135-3278` to match sequence. Document design notes in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/orientation_design.md`.
- Remove the `.item()` call added during F2 when storing `self.close_distance` so gradients survive; keep it as a tensor on detector device/dtype and adjust simulator usage if necessary. Capture verification in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/close_distance_gradcheck.md`.
- Re-run tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v` and append logs to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest.log`.
- Parity validation (Phase G3):
  - Run C binary with the supervisor command, emit logs into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity/c_reference/command.log` (include stdout/stderr, pix0 + orientation dump).
  - Run PyTorch CLI with identical command, logging to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity/pytorch/command.log` and store float images in matching directories.
  - Compute metrics via `nb-compare --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity -- -mat A.mat ...` (full command from prompts/supervisor.md); summarize correlation/RMSE in `parity/metrics.json`.
- Orientation trace: reuse `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py` to dump a/b/c vectors post-misset for both implementations; place summaries in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation.md`.
- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempts and plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md (G1–G3 rows) with status, command snippets, and artifact links before ending the loop.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not leave `self.close_distance` as a float; gradients must stay connected to detector distance.
- Preserve device/dtype neutrality—no `.cpu()` or hard-coded `torch.float64` allocations inside orientation paths.
- Avoid rebuilding canonical reciprocal bases when MOSFLM vectors are supplied; treat missing data as the fallback case only.
- Maintain vectorization: orientation tensors should broadcast across batches, no new Python loops.
- Keep Protected Assets untouched (`docs/index.md` references loop.sh, input.md, etc.).
- Follow trace-first debugging: if parity fails, gather traces before tweaking physics.
- Do not delete `scaled.hkl` or `A.mat`; they are referenced in docs/index.md and the parity harness.
- Ensure CLI parsing still handles meter/mm pix0 overrides after orientation changes; rerun the CLI tests to confirm.
- Capture all parity outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`; lack of artifacts blocks plan closure.
- Remember to update docs/fix_plan.md and plan markdown in the same commit after recording artifacts.

-- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass. (3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces. (4) Once geometry parity holds, execute Phase H polarization alignment and clean up residual artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).
+- Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation through the Crystal pipeline; (2) Leave Phase F3 parity blocked until orientation wiring is complete, then rerun the supervisor harness and update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/`; (3) Address the Phase F2 regression where `self.close_distance` now calls `.item()`—restore a tensor-based value so detector distance remains differentiable before layering additional changes. (4) After geometry parity holds, proceed to Phase H polarization alignment and tidy residual artifacts (e.g., `scaled.hkl.1`).

Active Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G orientation + detector gradient hygiene
Summary: Implement Phase G orientation wiring and restore differentiable close_distance
Phase: Implementation
Focus: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Phase G — MOSFLM matrix orientation
Branch: feature/spec-based-2

Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/

Do Now: [CLI-FLAGS-003] Handle -nonoise and -pix0_vector_mm (Phase G1) — env AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v

If Blocked: Capture C & PyTorch crystal-vector traces for the supervisor command at pixel (1039,685); save diff as reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/orientation_blocked_trace.md and add the divergence summary to docs/fix_plan.md Attempts.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:80 — Phase G (G1–G3) is the bottleneck preventing parity rerun; orientation from -mat must reach Crystal intact.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Fix-plan next actions call out MOSFLM A* retention and the close_distance tensor regression; both must be cleared before Phase H.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md:140 — Architecture requires reciprocal vectors to remain tensor-valued and reusable across rotations; orientation wiring must honor this.
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md:40 — CLI↔PyTorch parity mandates storing MOSFLM A* exactly as parsed; use this mapping when threading through configs.
- docs/debugging/debugging.md:34 — Parallel trace workflow remains mandatory; Phase G3 evidence must use TRACE_C/TRACE_PY comparison.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json — Current correlation ≈−5e-06 sets the baseline we must beat once orientation is fixed.

How-To Map:
- Export required env vars upfront:
- "'`export AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md`
- `export NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` on every Python/pytest run.
- Phase G1 implementation steps:
- In `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py`, after `read_mosflm_matrix`, store Å⁻¹ reciprocal vectors on the config dict (`config['"'a_star']"'`, etc.).
- Convert numpy arrays to tensors lazily in Crystal to preserve device/dtype neutrality.
- Document decisions in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/config_notes.md`.
- Phase G2 implementation steps:
- Extend `CrystalConfig` dataclass to accept optional reciprocal vectors; default to None when CLI did not supply `-mat`.
- Update `Crystal` to use supplied vectors before constructing canonical ones; still perform misset + metric duality recalculations per Core Rules 12–13.
- Ensure reciprocal→real→reciprocal cycle recreates `V_actual` volume when orientation is provided.
- Keep new tensors differentiable; no `.item()`, `.numpy()`, or `.cpu()` inside the main pipeline.
- Record design reasoning in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/orientation_design.md`.
- Detector gradient hygiene:
- Replace the `.item()` assignment for `self.close_distance` with tensor-safe storage.
- Audit simulator usages (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:933`, `:1014`) to accept tensor inputs without implicit detaches.
- Create a quick grad sanity check (e.g., differentiate intensity w.r.t. distance) and log results to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/close_distance_gradcheck.md`.
- Testing sequence:
- `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v`
- If CUDA available, rerun `pytest` with `--device cuda` (document availability in reports).
- Capture full pytest output into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/pytest.log`.
- Parity harness (Phase G3):
- Run C binary with supervisor command; log stdout/stderr to `parity/c_reference/command.log` and keep float image.
- Run PyTorch CLI with identical command; log to `parity/pytorch/command.log` and archive new float image.
- Execute `nb-compare --outdir reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/parity -- -mat A.mat ...` (full args from prompts/supervisor.md) to compute metrics.json.
- Parallel trace validation:
- Use `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py` with updated configs to dump lattice vectors; store logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_pytorch.log` and diff vs C trace (`trace_c.log`).
- Summarize first divergence (or lack thereof) in `trace_summary_orientation.md`.
- Documentation updates:
- Append Attempt #14 to `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` in docs/fix_plan.md summarizing Phase G progress, metrics, and close_distance fix.
- Update `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` by marking G1/G2/G3 status and linking artifact paths.
- Archive parity outputs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/` per Protected Assets expectations.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Leaving `self.close_distance` as float breaks gradients; keep it tensor-valued.
- Recomputing canonical reciprocal axes when orientation is supplied will destroy MOSFLM intent; only fall back when vectors missing.
- Introducing device mismatches (CPU temp tensors inside CUDA runs) will break parity and perf; coerce via `.to()` as needed.
- Forgetting to update Crystal caches after injecting orientation will result in stale pixel coordinates; invalidate caches properly.
- Skipping trace comparison violates debugging SOP; always capture TRACE_C/TRACE_PY when parity fails.
- Editing or deleting assets listed in docs/index.md (e.g., loop.sh, input.md) is forbidden.
- Neglecting to rerun CLI tests risks regressing existing flag behavior; keep `tests/test_cli_flags.py` green.
- Deviating from vectorized tensor math (e.g., loops over pixels) will tank performance and fail guardrails.
- Forgetting to log artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/` leaves plan evidence incomplete.
- Allowing `scaled.hkl.1` cleanup before parity succeeds risks losing reproduction inputs; defer hygiene until plan closure.

Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.

(3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces.

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass. (3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces. (4) Once geometry parity holds, execute Phase H polarization alignment and clean up residual artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).

   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass. (3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces. (4) Once geometry parity holds, execute Phase H polarization alignment and clean up residual artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).

 ### Phase G — MOSFLM Matrix Orientation Support
 Goal: Preserve full crystal orientation from `-mat` files so PyTorch matches C lattice vectors and downstream physics.


[2025-10-06T04:23:14] thinking

**Drafting final analysis response**

I’m putting together a clear summary that outlines long-term analysis results, key issues like orientation loss and gradient regression, and structured hypotheses ranked by confidence with evidence and next steps. I’ll include detailed references to files and lines for plan updates, commit review findings, and input changes, then wrap up with recommendations and mention that no tests were run. Time to organize all this into neat bullet lists under helpful headers.
[2025-10-06T04:23:15] codex

**Assessment**
- Phase G remains the primary blocker: `-mat` orientation data is still discarded before Crystal construction, leaving parity at correlation ≈ −5e-06 (reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/metrics.json).
- Phase F2 introduced a regression—`Detector.close_distance` now calls `.item()`, detaching gradients needed by downstream solid-angle tests (docs/fix_plan.md:448, src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:626).
- Planning docs now reflect reality: Phase F2 marked complete, F3 deferred until orientation lands (plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:87).
- Fresh instructions for Ralph are staged in input.md:1 with detailed Phase G checklist and artifact expectations under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/`.

**Hypotheses**
- H1 (confidence high): PyTorch never consumes MOSFLM A* vectors from `A.mat`, so lattice frames stay canonical and drive the 116× intensity mismatch. Evidence: docs/fix_plan.md:448; metrics.json referenced above. Confirm by threading `read_mosflm_matrix` outputs into Crystal and rerunning parity.
- H2 (confidence medium): The `.item()` assignment on `close_distance` breaks detector gradients and can perturb obliquity scaling tests, risking additional parity drift once orientation is fixed. Evidence: tests/test_at_geo_006.py:46 expectation; detector code at src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:626. Confirm by re-establishing tensor storage and rerunning geometry tests.
- H3 (confidence low): Remaining correlation gap after orientation likely stems from polarization mismatch (C Kahn factor ≈0.913 vs PyTorch 1.0). Evidence: Phase E trace notes in docs/fix_plan.md:457. Confirm after H1/H2 by auditing polarization inputs and rerunning parity.

**Actions Taken**
- Updated `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:76-89` to flag F2 as done, defer F3 until G1/G2 finish, and remind about the close_distance tensor fix.
- Refreshed `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` entry in docs/fix_plan.md:448-645 with new next actions (Phase G orientation + gradient hygiene) and superseded the outdated F2 follow-up notes.
- Logged current state and follow-ups in galph_memory.md (latest entry).
- Rebuilt input.md:1-100 with Phase G Do Now, pytest targets, parity harness commands, and artifact routing for Ralph.

**Next Steps**
- 1) Implement plan tasks G1–G3: persist MOSFLM reciprocal vectors through config → Crystal, then validate via trace + parity harness (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/…`).
- 2) Restore differentiable `close_distance` (no `.item()`), rerun `pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py tests/test_at_geo_003.py -v`, and capture the log noted in input.md.
- 3) After orientation parity succeeds, return to Phase H polarization alignment and resume `[VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001]` evidence gathering.

Tests: not run.

 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions: (1) Reopen plan Phase F2 to port the full CUSTOM pix0 transform from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 (compute Fclose/Sclose, rotate through detector matrices, and recompute `distance_corrected` from the updated `close_distance`); capture a validation dump under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt` before marking done. (2) After F2 lands, rerun plan Phase F3 parity smoke (supervisor command for both binaries) and refresh metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/parity_after_detector_fix/` so Attempt #12 transitions from partial to pass. (3) Proceed to plan Phase G (G1–G3) to retain MOSFLM A* orientation throughout Crystal and update traces. (4) Once geometry parity holds, execute Phase H polarization alignment and clean up residual artifacts (e.g., delete `scaled.hkl.1`).
