review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

Overview (Normative)

- Purpose: Simulates far-field diffraction from a perfect-lattice nanocrystal on a pixelated area
detector. No near-field propagation or detector PSF beyond pixel solid-angle/obliquity is modeled.
No symmetry is imposed; reflection indexing is P1 only (no Friedel pairing).
- Scope: Renders pixel intensities from a set of sources (beam divergence and spectral dispersion),
crystal orientation (including rotation oscillation and mosaic domains), and detector geometry.
Outputs: raw float image, SMV-format integer image (with and without Poisson noise), and optional
PGM.
- Key constants:
    - Classical electron radius squared r_e^2 = 7.94079248018965e-30 m^2.
    - Avogadro’s number = 6.02214179e23 mol^-1.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

## Quick Reference Table

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-24 refresh): Follow `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H5 items before resuming normalization work:
  1. Refresh C precedence evidence (H5a): rerun the supervisor command with and without `-pix0_vector_mm`, stash logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-21/`, and update `phase_h5/c_precedence.md` to document that C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` when the override is supplied alongside custom vectors.
  2. Capture PyTorch traces with the reinstated override (H5c): extend/execute the Phase H trace harness so it logs `pix0_vector`, derived `Fbeam/Sbeam`, fractional h/k/l, and `F_latt` components. Archive outputs to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/` and append the C vs PyTorch deltas to `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`.
  3. Implement the unit correction for beam-center mapping (H5e): confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` remains in mm, update `Detector._configure_geometry` to convert to meters before computing F/S beams, and capture before/after traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` with Attempt #33 logging Δpix0 < 5e-5 m.
  4. Once geometry parity is verified (H5d), transition to Phase K normalization tasks.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

**Considering environment variable and next steps**

[2025-10-06T17:11:52] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md' succeeded in 667ms:
## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).
  * `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` (≈2993-3151) — definitive implementation of the sincg calls and rounding logic.
  * `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` — simulator reference; docstring currently claims full-h usage and must be updated post-fix.
  * `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative pytest/trace commands for CLI parity evidence.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

**Drafting a multi-step plan**

I'm mapping out a detailed plan to analyze the codebase for CLI parity and vectorization goals, involving gathering context from commits, forming debugging hypotheses, flipping a coin to decide course, updating plans, and preparing documentation before committing changes. This structured approach will help tackle the complexity step-by-step.

Author: ollie <ohoidn>
Date:   Mon Oct 6 10:01:35 2025 -0700

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase K1: Fix SQUARE lattice factor formula (sincg arg bug)
    
    Fixed SQUARE lattice factor calculation in compute_lattice_shape_factor
    and trace block from incorrect sincg(π·(h-h0), Na) to correct
    sincg(π·h, Na) per specs/spec-a-core.md §4.3 and nanoBragg.c:3071.
    
    This bug caused 463× F_latt error identified in Phase J trace analysis
    (Attempt #28). ROUND/GAUSS/TOPHAT shapes correctly use (h-h0) but
    SQUARE must use fractional h directly per grating formula.
    
    Changes:
    - simulator.py:211-253: Added C-code reference docstring (nanoBragg.c:3062-3081)
      and corrected SQUARE F_latt formula
    - simulator.py:1289-1300: Fixed trace block to match production code
    - tests/test_cli_scaling.py: New parity test for F_latt validation

## [ROUTING-LOOP-001] loop.sh routing guard
- Spec/AT: Prompt routing rules (prompts/meta.md)
- Priority: High
- Status: done (verified compliant 2025-10-01)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-01 (verification and completion)
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: `sed -n '1,80p' loop.sh`
  * PyTorch: n/a
  * Shapes/ROI: n/a
- First Divergence (if known): Commit `c49e3be` reverted the guard—`loop.sh` pipes `prompts/main.md` through `{1..40}` loop, removes `git pull --rebase`, and performs unconditional `git push`.
- Immediate Next Actions (2025-10-13):
  * Run plan Phase A tasks (A1–A3) against commit `c49e3be` so the regression evidence references the latest violation, then confirm the current guarded script via Phase C compliance log before re-archiving the plan.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-12] Attempt #6 — Result: regression reopened. Detected commit `c49e3be` (loop.sh) restoring the 40-iteration `prompts/main.md` pipeline and stripping the timeouted `git pull --rebase`/conditional push added in `ffd9a5c`. No new audit artifacts captured; automation must stay paused until Phase A evidence is refreshed under `reports/routing/`.
    Metrics: n/a (manual inspection).

Validation: `tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override::test_pix0_vector_mm_beam_pivot` (CPU) and evidence log `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/pix0_override_validation.md`. Residual pix0 Y-delta (≈3.9 mm) traced to missing post-rotation `Fbeam/Sbeam` recomputation and deferred to H4. |

Regression test now covers BOTH precedence cases (custom vectors ignored, standard path applies override) and records expected C pix0 vector in `pix0_expected.json`. CUDA parametrisation remains skipped until parity fix lands; tolerance temporarily relaxed to 5 mm pending H4 geometry alignment. |

| H4c | Tighten regression test + targeted pytest | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-17 Attempt #25: Updated regression tolerance to 5e-5 m (CPU and CUDA parametrised) and captured `pytest_h4c.log`; Attempt #25 logged in docs/fix_plan.md. |

### Phase H5 — Custom Vector Pix0 Override Parity
Goal: Bring PyTorch pix0 precedence back in line with C when custom detector vectors accompany `-pix0_vector_mm`, eliminating the 1.14 mm delta driving the `F_latt` mismatch.
Prereqs: Phase H4 artifacts available; C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.
Exit Criteria: Detector traces with custom vectors show `pix0_vector`, `Fbeam`, and `Sbeam` matching C within 5e-5 m, and fractional h/k/l plus `F_latt_a/b/c` align within 1e-3 relative difference before resuming normalization work.

| H5b | Revert PyTorch override when custom vectors supplied | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31 (commit 831b670). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now gates pix0 overrides behind a `has_custom_vectors` check; regression log captured in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/pytest_h5b_revert.log`. Comments cite `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`. |
| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [ ] | After the revert, rerun the Phase H trace harness so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/` contains TRACE_PY logs for pix0, F/S beams, h/k/l, and `F_latt`. Update `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with C vs PyTorch deltas; require `|Δpix0| < 5e-5 m` and `F_latt` ratio within 1e-3 before Phase K resumes. |
| H5d | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31. docs/fix_plan.md logs the revert metrics and artifacts (Attempt #31), so Phase K normalization work can proceed with the restored baseline. |
| H5e | Correct beam-center→F/S mapping units | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-24 Attempt #33. `Detector._configure_geometry` now converts `self.config.beam_center_f/s` (mm) to meters via `/1000.0` before computing Fbeam/Sbeam, resolving the 1.1mm ΔF error. All 26 CLI flags tests passing. Artifacts: `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:490-515`, `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #33. Original task: Investigate the 2025-10-22 trace deltas showing ΔF≈-1.1 mm. Confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` is stored in millimetres (see `__main__.py:915-937`) and update `Detector._configure_geometry` so BEAM-pivot F/S values convert mm→m before constructing pix0 (match `nanoBragg.c:1184-1239`). Add targeted trace demonstrating the fix under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` and record Attempt #33 in fix_plan with metrics. |

# Phase H5 Parity Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Task:** CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H5 — Reinstate C precedence for pix0 overrides when custom detector vectors are supplied
**Goal:** Confirm the revert that skips `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present, then capture matching PyTorch traces so Phase K normalization work starts from a geometry-accurate baseline.

## Implementation Snapshot

### Code Changes
**File:** `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`

1. **Restored custom-vector guard** (lines ≈518-540):
   - Added `has_custom_vectors = any([...])` helper mirroring C precedence.
   - Gated pix0 override projection with `if pix0_override_tensor is not None and not has_custom_vectors:`.
   - Refreshed comments to cite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` (evidence that C ignores the override in this configuration).

2. **Doc updates**:
   - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/implementation_notes.md` now records the revert (Attempt #31) and supersedes Attempt #29 notes.

**Assessing post-H5e fix analysis and hypotheses**

I'm reviewing the remaining gaps after the H5e fix, focusing on verifying `-nonoise` support and `-pix0_vector_mm` accuracy. I'm considering whether to run trace harness scripts to gather fresh evidence for parity and orientation issues, mindful of instructions about not altering files. At the same time, I'll formulate hypotheses about lingering intensity mismatches and orientation matrix usage, checking Phase G status to understand unresolved root causes.

Beam vector now exactly matches C trace. Artifacts in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f/`. See docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #11. |
| F2 | Port CUSTOM pix0 transform for overrides | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: CUSTOM pathway from nanoBragg.c:1739-1846 ported (pivot override, MOSFLM vs CUSTOM offsets, close_distance recompute). Validation report at `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_f2/pix0_transform_refit.txt`. Follow-up: ensure downstream uses keep `close_distance` as a tensor (no `.item()` detaches) when further tuning detector gradients. |

Defer rerun until Phase G (A* orientation) lands so parity failure isn’t repeated; once orientation is wired, rerun parity and refresh metrics. |

### Phase G — MOSFLM Matrix Orientation Support
Goal: Preserve full crystal orientation from `-mat` files so PyTorch matches C lattice vectors and downstream physics.
Prereqs: Detector parity (Phase F) achieved or at least traced; clarity on orientation data flow.
Exit Criteria: Crystal trace (rotated a/b/c vectors) aligns with C for the supervisor command; CLI accepts orientation without manual overrides.

Tests: 26/26 passed (CLI), 35/35 passed (crystal). Metric duality perfect. Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/README.md`. |
| G3 | Trace verification + parity rerun | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06 Attempt #18 (ralph). Fixed MOSFLM matrix transpose bug (`src/nanobrag_torch/io/mosflm.py:88`). Reciprocal vectors now match C exactly (9/9 components to 16 decimals). Miller indices match: (2,2,-13). F_cell perfect match: 300.58. Real vectors within 0.05Å (<0.2% error). Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation_fixed.md`, `traces/trace_c.log`, `traces/trace_py_fixed.log`. Intensity parity still divergent (deferred to Phase H polarization). |

**Summarizing fix impact and plan updates**

I'm noting that although the SQUARE fix for F_latt is done, the traces and scaling analysis haven't been rerun yet, so existing data is outdated. I need to update the active plan and docs to mark K1 done, add tasks for rerunning traces and scaling tests with the new fix, and provide clear instructions referencing recent commits to ensure parity verification. I'll gather relevant info to revise plans, parity summaries, and create input files for next steps accordingly.

Summary: Align the PyTorch SQUARE lattice factor with the nanoBragg.c reference so the supervisor command can finally run end-to-end.
Phase: Implementation

Branch: feature/spec-based-2

Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase K1 — Align SQUARE F_latt with C; author tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c then run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`
If Blocked: Capture a delta table with `scripts/debug_flatt_difference.py` and park the attempt under reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_k/f_latt_fix/attempts/, then log the stall and metrics in docs/fix_plan.md before calling for help.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:160 spells out Phase K1, so finishing that row is prerequisite to every downstream parity task.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:218 defines SQUARE lattice factor as Π sincg(π·h, Na), making `(h-h0)` a spec violation that we must remove.
- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3069-3079 is the authoritative C loop; the PyTorch branch has to match those sincg arguments exactly.
- docs/fix_plan.md:484-497 (Attempt #28) already diagnosed the 463× F_latt gap; ignoring it blocks the top long-term goal.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/trace_py_scaling.log still shows F_latt≈7.69e1 instead of 3.56e4, proving the bug remains live.
- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:37-120 requires targeted pytest automation and evidence, not manual screenshots.

Prereqs: Phase H4 artifacts available; C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.
Exit Criteria: Detector traces with custom vectors show `pix0_vector`, `Fbeam`, and `Sbeam` matching C within 5e-5 m, and fractional h/k/l plus `F_latt_a/b/c` align within 1e-3 relative difference before resuming normalization work.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H5a | Verify C precedence with explicit derivation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #30. C traces stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/` prove geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are present. `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` carries the dot-product derivation. |
| H5b | Revert PyTorch override when custom vectors supplied | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31 (commit 831b670). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now gates pix0 overrides behind a `has_custom_vectors` check; regression log captured in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/pytest_h5b_revert.log`. Comments cite `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`. |
| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [ ] | After the revert, rerun the Phase H trace harness so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/` contains TRACE_PY logs for pix0, F/S beams, h/k/l, and `F_latt`. Update `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with C vs PyTorch deltas; require `|Δpix0| < 5e-5 m` and `F_latt` ratio within 1e-3 before Phase K resumes. |
| H5d | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31. docs/fix_plan.md logs the revert metrics and artifacts (Attempt #31), so Phase K normalization work can proceed with the restored baseline. |
| H5e | Correct beam-center→F/S mapping units | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-24 Attempt #33. `Detector._configure_geometry` now converts `self.config.beam_center_f/s` (mm) to meters via `/1000.0` before computing Fbeam/Sbeam, resolving the 1.1mm ΔF error. All 26 CLI flags tests passing. Artifacts: `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:490-515`, `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #33. Original task: Investigate the 2025-10-22 trace deltas showing ΔF≈-1.1 mm. Confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` is stored in millimetres (see `__main__.py:915-937`) and update `Detector._configure_geometry` so BEAM-pivot F/S values convert mm→m before constructing pix0 (match `nanoBragg.c:1184-1239`). Add targeted trace demonstrating the fix under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` and record Attempt #33 in fix_plan with metrics. |

### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I1 | Audit polarization inputs | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-17. C defaults polar=1.0/polarization=0.0/nopolar=0 verified at nanoBragg.c:308-309. PyTorch BeamConfig.polarization_factor was defaulting to 0.0 instead of 1.0. |
| I2 | Implement polarization parity | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-17. Updated BeamConfig.polarization_factor default to 1.0 (config.py:483-487). Added TestCLIPolarization with 3 tests (test_cli_flags.py:591-675). Tests verify default=1.0, -nopolar flag, and -polar override. |

Prereqs: Phase H4 artifacts available; C precedence proof in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.
Exit Criteria: Detector traces with custom vectors show `pix0_vector`, `Fbeam`, and `Sbeam` matching C within 5e-5 m, and fractional h/k/l plus `F_latt_a/b/c` align within 1e-3 relative difference before resuming normalization work.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H5a | Verify C precedence with explicit derivation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #30. C traces stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/` prove geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are present. `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` carries the dot-product derivation. |
| H5b | Revert PyTorch override when custom vectors supplied | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31 (commit 831b670). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now gates pix0 overrides behind a `has_custom_vectors` check; regression log captured in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/pytest_h5b_revert.log`. Comments cite `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`. |
| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [ ] | After the H5e unit conversion fix (Attempt #33), rerun the Phase H trace harness so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log` reflects the corrected pix0 vector. Diff against the 2025-10-22 C trace, refresh `parity_summary.md` with `|Δpix0| < 5e-5 m` and `F_latt` ratio within 1e-3, and log Attempt #35 before resuming Phase K. |
| H5d | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31. docs/fix_plan.md logs the revert metrics and artifacts (Attempt #31), so Phase K normalization work can proceed with the restored baseline. |
| H5e | Correct beam-center→F/S mapping units | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-24 Attempt #33. `Detector._configure_geometry` now converts `self.config.beam_center_f/s` (mm) to meters via `/1000.0` before computing Fbeam/Sbeam, resolving the 1.1mm ΔF error. All 26 CLI flags tests passing. Artifacts: `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:490-515`, `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #33. Original task: Investigate the 2025-10-22 trace deltas showing ΔF≈-1.1 mm. Confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` is stored in millimetres (see `__main__.py:915-937`) and update `Detector._configure_geometry` so BEAM-pivot F/S values convert mm→m before constructing pix0 (match `nanoBragg.c:1184-1239`). Add targeted trace demonstrating the fix under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` and record Attempt #33 in fix_plan with metrics. |

### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)
Goal: Match C’s Kahn polarization factor once lattice geometry aligns.
Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I1 | Audit polarization inputs | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-17. C defaults polar=1.0/polarization=0.0/nopolar=0 verified at nanoBragg.c:308-309. PyTorch BeamConfig.polarization_factor was defaulting to 0.0 instead of 1.0. |
| I2 | Implement polarization parity | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-17. Updated BeamConfig.polarization_factor default to 1.0 (config.py:483-487). Added TestCLIPolarization with 3 tests (test_cli_flags.py:591-675). Tests verify default=1.0, -nopolar flag, and -polar override. |

This is the second geometry gap alongside the pix0 transform issue documented in Attempt #5 (Phase E). Running the evidence harness also created a duplicate copy of the structure-factor file (`scaled.hkl.1`, identical to `scaled.hkl`) in the repo root; treat it as an artefact that needs removal during the upcoming implementation pass so repo hygiene stays intact.\n    Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase E tasks E1-E3 to generate full C/PyTorch traces with this configuration; (2) Implement detector fix to accept and use `custom_beam_vector` from config while maintaining differentiability/device-neutrality (documented in detector.md §5); (3) Re-run beam_vector_check to verify alignment before parity retry; (4) Delete the stray `scaled.hkl.1` artefact once the investigation concludes (confirm prior to Protected Assets scan).\n  * [2025-10-05] Attempt #8 (ralph) — Result: success (Phase E1-E3 complete). **Crystal lattice orientation bug discovered as primary root cause.**\n    Metrics: C pix0_vector = `-0.21648, 0.21634, -0.23019`; PyTorch pix0_vector = `-0.21634, 0.21521, -0.23020` (1.14 mm Y-axis error).

**Goal:** Confirm the revert that skips `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present, then capture matching PyTorch traces so Phase K normalization work starts from a geometry-accurate baseline.

⚠️ **Update queued (2025-10-24):** Metrics below still reference the 2025-10-22 PyTorch trace captured before Attempt #33. Rerun Phase H5c to regenerate `py_traces/2025-10-24/` and refresh this summary once the new pix0/F/S deltas land.


### Code Changes
**File:** `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`

1. **Restored custom-vector guard** (lines ≈518-540):
   - Added `has_custom_vectors = any([...])` helper mirroring C precedence.
   - Gated pix0 override projection with `if pix0_override_tensor is not None and not has_custom_vectors:`.
   - Refreshed comments to cite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` (evidence that C ignores the override in this configuration).

2. **Doc updates**:
   - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/implementation_notes.md` now records the revert (Attempt #31) and supersedes Attempt #29 notes.

   124	| --- | --- | --- | --- |
   125	| H5a | Verify C precedence with explicit derivation | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #30. C traces stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/` prove geometry is identical with or without `-pix0_vector_mm` when custom vectors are present. `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md` carries the dot-product derivation. |
   126	| H5b | Revert PyTorch override when custom vectors supplied | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31 (commit 831b670). `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector` now gates pix0 overrides behind a `has_custom_vectors` check; regression log captured in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/pytest_h5b_revert.log`. Comments cite `c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`. |
   127	| H5c | Capture updated PyTorch traces & compare | [ ] | After the H5e unit conversion fix (Attempt #33), rerun the Phase H trace harness so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log` reflects the corrected pix0 vector. Diff against the 2025-10-22 C trace, refresh `parity_summary.md` with `|Δpix0| < 5e-5 m` and `F_latt` ratio within 1e-3, and log Attempt #35 before resuming Phase K. |
   128	| H5d | Update fix_plan Attempt log | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-22 Attempt #31. docs/fix_plan.md logs the revert metrics and artifacts (Attempt #31), so Phase K normalization work can proceed with the restored baseline. |
   129	| H5e | Correct beam-center→F/S mapping units | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-24 Attempt #33. `Detector._configure_geometry` now converts `self.config.beam_center_f/s` (mm) to meters via `/1000.0` before computing Fbeam/Sbeam, resolving the 1.1mm ΔF error. All 26 CLI flags tests passing. Artifacts: `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py:490-515`, `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #33. Original task: Investigate the 2025-10-22 trace deltas showing ΔF≈-1.1 mm. Confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` is stored in millimetres (see `__main__.py:915-937`) and update `Detector._configure_geometry` so BEAM-pivot F/S values convert mm→m before constructing pix0 (match `nanoBragg.c:1184-1239`). Add targeted trace demonstrating the fix under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` and record Attempt #33 in fix_plan with metrics. |

   131	### Phase I — Polarization Alignment (follow-up)

   133	Prereqs: Phases F–H complete; traces show `F_latt` parity.
   134	Exit Criteria: Polarization entries in C/PyTorch traces agree (≈0.9126 for supervisor command) and parity smoke stays green.

   137	| --- | --- | --- | --- |
   138	| I1 | Audit polarization inputs | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-17. C defaults polar=1.0/polarization=0.0/nopolar=0 verified at nanoBragg.c:308-309. PyTorch BeamConfig.polarization_factor was defaulting to 0.0 instead of 1.0. |
   139	| I2 | Implement polarization parity | [D] | ✅ Completed 2025-10-17. Updated BeamConfig.polarization_factor default to 1.0 (config.py:483-487). Added TestCLIPolarization with 3 tests (test_cli_flags.py:591-675). Tests verify default=1.0, -nopolar flag, and -polar override. |

Summary: Capture post-unit-fix pix0 traces so Phase K uses fresh geometry evidence before any new code.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H5c trace refresh
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log

If Blocked: Document the blocker in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/attempt_log.md with stdout/stderr, then halt and ping supervisor.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:127 keeps H5c open, so we need the new trace before K2/K3 can proceed.
- docs/fix_plan.md:470-517 now calls for fresh pix0 evidence and scaling reruns; without it the top initiative stalls.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md:6 warns the current metrics predate Attempt #33 and must be replaced.
- specs/spec-a-core.md: geometry+pivot rules make meter-level pix0 agreement (<5e-5 m) a hard parity requirement.

How-To Map:
- Ensure `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` is exported so downstream scripts keep parity contexts aligned.
- Run the Do Now command from repo root; capture stdout to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout` for trace diffing.
- Diff the new trace against `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log` and note Δpix0/F/S in `parity_summary.md`.
- Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with the new deltas and mark compliance with the 5e-5 m tolerance.
- Log Attempt #35 in docs/fix_plan.md with metrics + artifact paths before leaving the loop.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not touch code or tests—this is evidence-only.
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` on every Python invocation to avoid MKL crashes.
- Reuse the existing report directories; no ad-hoc paths or filenames.
- Do not regenerate the C trace (2025-10-22 baseline remains authoritative for this step).
- Avoid running pytest or nb-compare; Phase gate forbids tests this loop.
- Maintain device neutrality in notes—trace harness already respects config, no `.cpu()` tweaks.
- Remember Protected Assets: leave docs/index.md and loop scripts untouched.
- Capture command outputs; silent success without artifacts fails the plan exit criteria.
- Leave NB_RUN_PARALLEL unset (default 0) to keep test scaffolding skipped.
- Don’t advance to Phase K tasks until parity_summary shows green metrics.

Pointers:

**Planning to expand file to required length**

I see the current file is too short compared to the target of about 100-200 lines, so I’m working out how to add meaningful detail while respecting bullet limits and structure constraints. I’m thinking of adding new sections with enumerated steps, detailed multi-line instructions, and careful expansion of existing lists to hit the right line count without losing clarity. This means a thorough rewrite focusing on richer content and organized formatting.

If Blocked: Log the failure (command + stderr) to reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/attempt_log.md and halt for supervisor guidance.

Timeline:
01. Confirm `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` remains exported in the shell; note it in attempt log.
02. Ensure editable install still active; no reinstall needed unless torch import fails.
03. Create `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/` before running harness.
04. Execute the Do Now trace harness; tee stdout to trace_py.stdout for later diffing.
05. Immediately copy `trace_py.log` to a scratch diff view against the 2025-10-22 baseline to spot unit-fix deltas.
06. Compute Δpix0, ΔFbeam, ΔSbeam manually (spreadsheet or python) and jot them into attempt log.
07. Verify the trace still reports the corrected `incident_vec` and rotated reciprocal vectors; flag any regressions.
08. Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with the new numeric deltas and tolerance checks.
09. Note in the summary whether `F_latt` ratios now fall inside 1e-3; this informs Phase K2 readiness.
10. Stage screenshots or diff snippets only if values look suspicious; otherwise keep artifacts textual.
11. Append Attempt #35 to docs/fix_plan.md with metrics, deltas, and artifact paths.
12. Mark H5c as done in plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md once evidence is committed.
13. Leave a short README stub in the new trace directory summarising the command, git hash, and environment variables.
14. Double-check no new binary files (e.g., .npy) were produced—cleanup immediately if so.
15. Signal completion in Attempts History and pause before touching Phase K2 tasks.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:127 keeps H5c open; new traces are prerequisite for K2/K3.
- docs/fix_plan.md:470-517 demands refreshed pix0 evidence plus scaling reruns before normalization continues.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md:6-18 now warns that current metrics predate Attempt #33.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120 mandates <5e-5 m pix0 tolerance; we must document compliance.

How-To Map:
- Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every python invocation; without it the harness may trip MKL.
- Run the Do Now command from repo root so relative paths resolve; capture stdout with `tee` to keep a textual artifact.
- Use `python -m filecmp` or `diff -u` to compare new trace against `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/trace_py.log`; record key differences.
- Update `parity_summary.md` by replacing the dated metrics table with the new numbers, noting pass/fail for pix0, F/S beams, and F_latt.
- In docs/fix_plan.md, add Attempt #35 under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (Δpix0, ΔFbeam, ΔSbeam, F_latt ratio) plus artifact references.
- Stage only report/doc updates; leave git tree clean except for these evidence files.

Trace Checklist:
- pix0_vector_meters (three components) — confirm Δ < 5e-5 m vs C trace.
- Fbeam/Sbeam scalars — ensure conversion now matches C within tolerance.
- hkl_frac triplet — verify rounding to (2,2,-13) persists.
- F_latt_a/b/c and product — expect close agreement with C once K1 fix in place.
- omega_pixel_sr and polar — note values but defer detailed analysis to Phase K2.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not rerun C trace; existing 2025-10-22 artifacts remain the comparator for this loop.
- Skip pytest/nb-compare entirely—Evidence gate forbids test execution.
- Resist tweaking simulator code; today is documentation + trace capture only.
- Avoid creating new directories outside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/`.
- Keep device/dtype neutral commentary; trace harness already respects configs.
- Protect docs/index.md and other protected assets per CLAUDE.md instructions.
- Document every command in attempt log to maintain reproducibility.
- If CUDA warms up unexpectedly, note it but do not debug—you’re on CPU path here.
- Leave NB_RUN_PARALLEL unset so parity pytest stays skipped.
- Don’t forget to commit/push the updated reports; supervisor automation expects clean git after run.

Data Notes:
- Baseline C trace: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log (use for diffing).
- Previous PyTorch trace: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/trace_py.log (contains pre-unit-fix pix0 error).
- Attempt log template: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/attempt_log_template.md (copy if blank).
- Target tolerances: pix0 < 5e-5 m, F_latt ratio within 1e-3, h/k/l residuals < 1e-6.
- Post-run checklist: update plan, fix_plan, parity_summary, and artifact README.

08. Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with the new numeric deltas and tolerance checks.
09. Note in the summary whether `F_latt` ratios now fall inside 1e-3; this informs Phase K2 readiness.
10. Stage screenshots or diff snippets only if values look suspicious; otherwise keep artifacts textual.
11. Append Attempt #35 to docs/fix_plan.md with metrics, deltas, and artifact paths.
12. Mark H5c as done in plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md once evidence is committed.
13. Leave a short README stub in the new trace directory summarising the command, git hash, and environment variables.
14. Double-check no new binary files (e.g., .npy) were produced—cleanup immediately if so.
15. Signal completion in Attempts History and pause before touching Phase K2 tasks.

Priorities & Rationale:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:127 keeps H5c open; new traces are prerequisite for K2/K3.
- docs/fix_plan.md:470-517 demands refreshed pix0 evidence plus scaling reruns before normalization continues.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md:6-18 now warns that current metrics predate Attempt #33.
- specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120 mandates <5e-5 m pix0 tolerance; we must document compliance.

How-To Map:
- Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every python invocation; without it the harness may trip MKL.
- Run the Do Now command from repo root so relative paths resolve; capture stdout with `tee` to keep a textual artifact.
- Use `python -m filecmp` or `diff -u` to compare new trace against `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/trace_py.log`; record key differences.
- Update `parity_summary.md` by replacing the dated metrics table with the new numbers, noting pass/fail for pix0, F/S beams, and F_latt.
- In docs/fix_plan.md, add Attempt #35 under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (Δpix0, ΔFbeam, ΔSbeam, F_latt ratio) plus artifact references.
- Stage only report/doc updates; leave git tree clean except for these evidence files.

Trace Checklist:
- pix0_vector_meters (three components) — confirm Δ < 5e-5 m vs C trace.
- Fbeam/Sbeam scalars — ensure conversion now matches C within tolerance.
- hkl_frac triplet — verify rounding to (2,2,-13) persists.
- F_latt_a/b/c and product — expect close agreement with C once K1 fix in place.
- omega_pixel_sr and polar — note values but defer detailed analysis to Phase K2.

Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not rerun C trace; existing 2025-10-22 artifacts remain the comparator for this loop.
- Skip pytest/nb-compare entirely—Evidence gate forbids test execution.
- Resist tweaking simulator code; today is documentation + trace capture only.
- Avoid creating new directories outside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/`.
- Keep device/dtype neutral commentary; trace harness already respects configs.
- Protect docs/index.md and other protected assets per CLAUDE.md instructions.
- Document every command in attempt log to maintain reproducibility.
- If CUDA warms up unexpectedly, note it but do not debug—you’re on CPU path here.
- Leave NB_RUN_PARALLEL unset so parity pytest stays skipped.
- Don’t forget to commit/push the updated reports; supervisor automation expects clean git after run.

Data Notes:
- Baseline C trace: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log (use for diffing).
- Previous PyTorch trace: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/trace_py.log (contains pre-unit-fix pix0 error).
- Attempt log template: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/attempt_log_template.md (copy if blank).
- Target tolerances: pix0 < 5e-5 m, F_latt ratio within 1e-3, h/k/l residuals < 1e-6.
- Post-run checklist: update plan, fix_plan, parity_summary, and artifact README.

Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:120-133
- docs/fix_plan.md:470-517
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md:6-18
- specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120

Next Up: Phase K2 scaling-chain refresh after H5c evidence lands (stay on this focus until supervisor review).

   * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
   * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
 - First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
-- Next Actions (2025-10-24 refresh): Follow `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H5 items before resuming normalization work:
-  1. Refresh C precedence evidence (H5a): rerun the supervisor command with and without `-pix0_vector_mm`, stash logs under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-21/`, and update `phase_h5/c_precedence.md` to document that C recomputes `Fbeam/Sbeam` when the override is supplied alongside custom vectors.
-  2. Capture PyTorch traces with the reinstated override (H5c): extend/execute the Phase H trace harness so it logs `pix0_vector`, derived `Fbeam/Sbeam`, fractional h/k/l, and `F_latt` components. Archive outputs to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/` and append the C vs PyTorch deltas to `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`.
-  3. Implement the unit correction for beam-center mapping (H5e): confirm `DetectorConfig.beam_center_*` remains in mm, update `Detector._configure_geometry` to convert to meters before computing F/S beams, and capture before/after traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/unit_fix/` with Attempt #33 logging Δpix0 < 5e-5 m.
-  4. Once geometry parity is verified (H5d), transition to Phase K normalization tasks.
+- Next Actions (2025-10-24 refresh): With H5a/H5b/H5e complete and K1 landed, push the remaining evidence before touching new implementation work:
+  1. Phase H5c — rerun `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py` so `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log` + `parity_summary.md` capture the post-unit-fix pix0/F/S deltas (<5e-5 m) and log Attempt #35.
+  2. Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain using the updated PyTorch trace (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` to confirm the SQUARE lattice factor now matches C.
+  3. Phase K3 — once H5c/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
+  4. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.

**Composing detailed final summary**

I'll organize the final message into clear sections: key file updates with line refs, a structured list of debugging hypotheses including evidence and next steps, a brief review of Ralph's recent loop work, and actionable next steps to keep the process moving forward. This should provide a concise but thorough overview for the user.
[2025-10-06T17:28:54] codex

**Key Updates**
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:125-133 marks H5c still open but remaps artifacts to `py_traces/2025-10-24/` and records K1 as complete so the checklist now points squarely at fresh trace evidence.
- docs/fix_plan.md:470-517 now directs Ralph to execute H5c → K2 → K3 in that order, blocking Phase L until new traces, scaling ratios, and targeted pytest logs exist.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md:6-10 carries an explicit 2025‑10‑24 TODO banner calling out that the posted metrics predate the beam-center unit fix.
- input.md:1-111 is rewritten for an Evidence-phase loop; it lays out a 25-step timeline, command template, telemetry checklist, and Do Now command for the H5c trace rerun.
- galph_memory.md:1201-1208 captures this directive so future supervisor loops know the plan/doc state; push includes commit `82cd893`.

**Debugging Hypotheses (CLI-FLAGS-003 parity)**
1. Outdated PyTorch pix0 trace is still driving the 1.1 mm fast-axis delta. Evidence: parity_summary.md and the 2025‑10‑22 TRACE_PY log show pre-unit-fix values; no 2025‑10‑24 trace exists. Confidence: high. Next confirming step: run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log` and compare against the 2025‑10‑22 C trace.
2. Scaling diagnostics (Phase J) still reference the old trace, so even after H5c the F_latt ratio may appear wrong until `phase_j/scaling_chain.md` is recomputed. Evidence: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md` cites F_latt≈76.9 from the stale trace. Confidence: medium. Next step: rerun `analyze_scaling.py` with the new `trace_py_after.log` once H5c is refreshed.
3. The new regression test (`tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c`) will stay red whenever `NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1` until H5c/K2 evidence lands. Evidence: Attempt #34 notes correlation 0.173 with pre-fix geometry; plan K3 is still open. Confidence: medium. Next step: defer pytest until H5c + K2 deliver updated logs, then rerun under the prescribed env vars.

**Ralph Review (last few iterations)**
- 0fef8f7 correctly ports the SQUARE sincg formula and adds a targeted parity test, but he stopped short of producing the supporting trace/pytest evidence (test currently fails when NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1).
- 315a54c fixed the beam-center mm→m conversion and kept CLI tests green; again, trace refresh was deferred.
- Overall trajectory is positive—core fixes landed without regressions—but loops are stalling on the evidence phase. Today’s memo and plan updates aim to reconnect those dots.

**Next Steps**
- Ralph should execute the H5c Do Now command, update parity_summary and docs/fix_plan with Attempt #35, then wait for review before advancing to Phase K2.
- Once trace evidence closes, line up the scaling-chain refresh and targeted pytest listed in docs/fix_plan.md:470-517.
- No action yet on the vectorization initiative (`plans/active/vectorization.md` remains at Phase A); expect a dedicated push once CLI parity is finally green.
