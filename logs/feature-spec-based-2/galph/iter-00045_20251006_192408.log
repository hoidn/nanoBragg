review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</2>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 


Debugging Items — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- Only when the selected item is a debugging or parity analysis task, formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</yes case>
</no case>
- Since you decided there's no need for planning, you will instead focus on review / housekeeping. 
- Once the above is done (or deemed unneeded): review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for this turn.
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</no case>
</3>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
- Phase: <Evidence | Implementation | Validation>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: When the Phase is Evidence, you must not execute tests; any pytest command included here is provided for Ralph’s subsequent loop.
<Do Now guidelines>
Phase Gate (Evidence): If the active plan phase is Evidence, do not run pytest at all (including collection). Limit evidence gathering to non-test probes and command‑line tooling (e.g., scripts/validation/*, minimal parity CLIs). Do not include runnable tests in this loop.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
</3.5>
<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

## Running The CLI

- Install (recommended):
  - `pip install -e .` from repo root (provides `nanoBragg` console script).
- Run (installed):
  - `nanoBragg -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Run (without install):
  - `PYTHONPATH=src python -m nanobrag_torch -hkl P1.hkl -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -floatfile out.bin`
- Minimal quick test (no HKL):
  - `nanoBragg -default_F 1 -cell 100 100 100 90 90 90 -lambda 1.0 -distance 100 -detpixels 128 -pgmfile test.pgm`

Notes
- Entry point: `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (module runner `python -m nanobrag_torch`).
- Required inputs: provide `-hkl` (or existing `Fdump.bin`) or set `-default_F > 0`, and either `-mat` (MOSFLM A*) or `-cell`.

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 (galph loop)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): With H6c completed and the unit-only divergence documented, focus on correcting the pivot mismatch before resuming normalization work:
  1. Phase H6e — capture explicit pivot evidence: cite the SAMPLE pivot message in `trace_c_pix0.log`, record the current PyTorch configuration (`DetectorConfig.from_cli_args(...).detector_pivot`) showing BEAM, and summarise the mismatch in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md` plus `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`.
  2. Phase H6f — update `DetectorConfig` pivot selection so any custom detector vectors or pix0 override force SAMPLE (matching nanoBragg), add a targeted regression test, and log implementation notes under `phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` with pytest evidence.
  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #39 in this ledger.
  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.
  5. Phase K3 — when H5c/H6g/K2 evidence is green, run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c -v`, archive the log under `phase_k/f_latt_fix/pytest.log`, and update the lattice notes in `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md`.
  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #27 (ralph) — Result: **PARITY FAILURE** (Phase I3 supervisor command). **Intensity scaling discrepancy: 124,538× sum ratio.**
    Metrics: Correlation=0.9978 (< 0.999 threshold), sum_ratio=124,538 (should be ~1.0), C max_I=446, PyTorch max_I=5.411e7 (121,000× discrepancy), mean_peak_distance=37.79 px (> 1 px threshold).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap correction (2025-10-22): Fresh C evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`) proves nanoBragg ignores `-pix0_vector_mm` whenever custom detector vectors are present. PyTorch now deviates because the lattice factor uses fractional indices (h−h0); fix required before normalization parity.
- Evidence status: Phase E artifacts (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/`) hold C/PyTorch traces, diffs, and beam-vector checks. Phase H3b1 also stashes WITH/without override traces under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/implementation/` for reference.
- Documentation anchors for this focus:
  * `specs/spec-a-core.md` — canonical lattice-factor formulas (SQUARE uses sincg(π·h, Na); ROUND/GAUSS definitions used to verify Phase K).
  * `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` (≈2993-3151) — definitive implementation of the sincg calls and rounding logic.
  * `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` — simulator reference; docstring currently claims full-h usage and must be updated post-fix.
  * `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative pytest/trace commands for CLI parity evidence.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog; supports long-term goal "Parallel parity + performance" from docs/fix_plan.md
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready, fully vectorized tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and follow with detector absorption vectorization without regressing physics, gradients, or device neutrality.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (Structure factors), specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (Interpolation acceptance tests), docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4, docs/architecture/c_code_overview.md (tricubic routines), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§2–4, docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint + detector absorption), `tests/test_at_str_002.py`, `tests/test_at_abs_001.py`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/` (current performance references). No dedicated tricubic/absorption microbenchmarks exist yet; Phase A will author reusable harnesses under `scripts/benchmarks/` so future loops can rerun baselines without ad-hoc snippets.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Document the current (non-vectorized) behavior, warnings, and performance so we can prove the impact of the refactor.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available for parity (when needed), environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest log, timing snippet results, and notes stored under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/` with references in docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Re-run tricubic acceptance tests | [ ] | `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py -v` ⇒ save log to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/test_at_str_002.log`; confirm nearest-neighbour fallback warning message appears for batched inputs. |
| A2 | Measure current tricubic runtime | [ ] | Author `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` (device/dtype neutral, honours `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`) and run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5`. Capture CPU timings (and CUDA when available) in `phase_a/tricubic_baseline.md` plus raw JSON/CSV under `phase_a/tricubic_baseline_results.json`. |
| A3 | Record detector absorption baseline | [ ] | Create `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` mirroring A2's interface; execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --repeats 5` alongside `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`. Store logs in `phase_a/absorption_baseline.md` and metrics in `phase_a/absorption_baseline_results.json`. |

### Phase B — Tricubic Vectorization Design
Goal: Lock the tensor-shape design, broadcasting plan, and gradient checks before code changes.
Prereqs: Phase A artifacts uploaded and referenced in docs/fix_plan.md.
Exit Criteria: Design memo (`reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_b/design_notes.md`) describing target shapes, indexing strategy, gradient expectations, and failure modes; docs/fix_plan.md updated with summary and link.

I’m focusing on deep analysis of the codebase and plans to understand progress on CLI support and vectorization goals. I’ll examine the current fix_plan and vectorization plan docs, particularly looking for entries like VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001, to identify issues or gaps and figure out how to proceed before reviewing Ralph’s commit history.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_planning (Phase A evidence outstanding)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks (to be created per plan Phase A): `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/sample_tricubic_baseline.py`
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions:
  1. Execute plan Phase A tasks A1–A3: author the reusable `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py` and `absorption_baseline.py` harnesses, capture pytest + timing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_a/`, and record Attempt #1 in this entry.
  2. Complete Phase B design memo (tensor shapes, broadcasting, gradients) before editing code; update this item with design references (`phase_b/design_notes.md`).
  3. Prioritise Phase C/D implementation work on tricubic interpolation, followed by Phase E parity/perf validation. Detector absorption vectorization (Phase F) follows once tricubic work is stable.
- Attempts History:
  * (pending) — Capture Phase A baseline artifacts and update this log.
- Risks/Assumptions: Must maintain differentiability (no `.item()`, no `torch.linspace` with tensor bounds), preserve device/dtype neutrality (CPU/CUDA parity), and obey Protected Assets rule (all new scripts under `scripts/benchmarks/`). Large tensor indexing may increase memory pressure; ensure ROI caching still works.
- Exit Criteria (quote thresholds from spec):
  * specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 tricubic acceptance tests run without warnings and match C parity within documented tolerances (corr≥0.9995, ≤1e-12 structural duality where applicable).

    [CLI-FLAGS-003 H6e] Confirm pivot parity - evidence: C SAMPLE vs PyTorch BEAM
    
    Phase H6e evidence-only loop complete. Documented detector pivot mismatch
    for supervisor command configuration.
    
    Evidence Summary:
    - C trace: 'pivoting detector around sample' (SAMPLE pivot)
    - PyTorch: DetectorPivot.BEAM (inline config inspection)
    - Root cause: DetectorConfig missing custom-vector → SAMPLE pivot rule

    CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6c: Document first divergence in pix0 trace comparison
    
    Evidence loop identifying beam_center_m unit mismatch between C and PyTorch traces.
    
    Key Findings:
    - First divergence: beam_center_m logged in mm (PyTorch) vs m (C) - 1000× scale
    - This is a trace logging issue, NOT a calculation error
    - Fclose/Sclose match exactly (0.217742295, 0.21390708 m), confirming internal calculation correct
    - Pix0 delta persists (ΔF=-1136μm, ΔS=+139μm, ΔO=-6μm) despite correct Fclose/Sclose
    - Indicates divergence in term_fast/term_slow/term_close combination or missing CUSTOM transform
    
    Artifacts:
    - reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/trace_diff.txt: Full unified diff
    - reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/analysis.md: Detailed numeric analysis with tables
    - reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md: Updated with H6c findings

**Assessing long-term CLI goals and plan status**

I'm examining the ongoing issues around the CLI command's pivot mismatch and intensity problems, noting some contradictory info on overrides. I’m also checking if existing plans and tasks like `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags are current and complete, while considering repo hygiene concerns about large artifacts at the root. Next, I’ll dive deeper into logs and reports to ensure the analysis covers all gaps and regressions before deciding on new plan needs.

# Phase H5 Parity Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24 (refreshed from 2025-10-22)
**Task:** CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H5c — Capture post-unit-fix PyTorch traces after Attempt #33
**Goal:** Verify whether Attempt #33's beam-center mm→m conversion resolved the pix0 discrepancy, then assess readiness for Phase K normalization work.

## Implementation Snapshot
✅ **Updated 2025-10-24 (Attempt #35):** Fresh PyTorch trace captured post-Attempt #33 unit fix. **Critical finding: Attempt #33's beam-center mm→m conversion did NOT affect pix0 calculation. Pix0 deltas identical to 2025-10-22 baseline, indicating the underlying pix0 discrepancy remains unresolved.**

### Code Changes (Prior Work)
**File:** `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`

1. **H5b - Restored custom-vector guard** (Attempt #31, lines ≈518-540):
   - Added `has_custom_vectors = any([...])` helper mirroring C precedence.
   - Gated pix0 override projection with `if pix0_override_tensor is not None and not has_custom_vectors:`.
   - Refreshed comments to cite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.

2. **H5e - Beam-center unit correction** (Attempt #33, lines 490-515):
   - Changed BEAM pivot Fbeam/Sbeam calculation to use `self.config.beam_center_f / 1000.0` instead of pixel-based values.
   - Addressed observed 1.1mm ΔF error from 2025-10-22 trace analysis.

**Analyzing debugging hypotheses and planning next steps**

I'm sorting through the pivot mismatch and intensity discrepancy issues by laying out possible root causes and tying them to existing evidence. I’m mapping out hypotheses for both pivot and intensity mismatches, planning triage steps, and also scanning recent commits to assess progress and documentation quality. Next, I’ll check if the current plan covers all necessary debugging tasks or needs refinement, especially around the H6 phase.

Trace archived at `phase_h6/py_trace/trace_py_pix0.log` with env/git snapshots; residual ΔF = −1136 µm confirms instrumentation succeeded and Phase H6c analysis is next. |
139:| H6c | Diff traces & isolate first divergence | [D] | ✅ Attempt #38 (2025-10-26) produced `phase_h6/analysis.md` and `trace_diff.txt`; first divergence is the trace harness labeling beam-center values in millimetres while C logs meters. Pix0 deltas (ΔF = −1.136 mm, ΔS = +0.139 mm) persist, so the physical mismatch remains unresolved. `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` now records these findings. |

C evidence: `grep "pivoting"` shows "pivoting detector around sample". PyTorch evidence: inline config snippet shows DetectorPivot.BEAM. Root cause confirmed: `DetectorConfig` missing custom-vector-to-SAMPLE-pivot forcing rule. Spec citations and impact analysis complete. Updated `phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with cross-reference. |

Add regression `tests/test_cli_flags.py::test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot` (CPU+CUDA) and log implementation notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md`. |

**Evaluating plan quality and next steps**

I'm reviewing whether the current vectorization plan is up to date and aligns with recent instructions, checking for timeline inconsistencies and unstarted tasks. I’m weighing if the pivot fix should be the immediate focus and planning next actions like producing input files for Ralph and updating memory notes before committing changes. I also plan to examine the detector.py code to verify pivot logic details.

**Considering planning approach for tasks**

I'm thinking about whether to use the plan tool to structure these complex tasks. Since the instructions say to use planning for tasks over 25% complexity, it seems wise to create a plan with three steps—gather data, analyze, and update docs—and invoke the plan tool to keep things organized and consistent.

**Clarifying plan tool absence and reviewing planning steps**

I realized there isn't an actual plan tool despite system references, so I'll disregard that and focus on evaluating the vectorization plan’s completeness and timelines. I’m considering whether to update the plan for upcoming tasks like the pivot fix and root-level image cleanup, weighing if these need explicit documentation or just review notes before producing the next instructions for Ralph. I'll also gather details needed to create targeted test instructions for the pivot fix task.

## 10. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### 10.1 Unit Confusion
**Pitfall:** Mixing mm and Angstrom units  
**Best Practice:** Always use Config classes which handle conversions automatically

### 10.2 Pixel Indexing
**Pitfall:** Assuming pixel centers instead of edges  
**Best Practice:** Remember that integer indices refer to pixel corners

### 10.3 Rotation Order
**Pitfall:** Applying rotations in wrong order  
**Best Practice:** Follow the exact sequence: rotx → roty → rotz → twotheta

# Detector Architecture Deep Dive

**Status:** Authoritative Specification  
**Last Updated:** Phase 5 Implementation

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This component uses a [hybrid unit system](#61-critical-hybrid-unit-system-overrides-global-rule) that overrides the global Angstrom-only rule.

This document provides the complete technical specification for the Detector component. For global project rules on units and coordinate systems, see [Global Conventions](./conventions.md).

## 1. Overview

The Detector class manages the detector geometry for diffraction simulations, including:
- Position and orientation (basis vectors)
- Pixel coordinate generation and caching
- Support for various detector conventions (MOSFLM, XDS)
- Dynamic geometry with rotations and tilts
- Full differentiability for optimization workflows

Summary: Capture concrete evidence that PyTorch still selects BEAM pivot while C runs the supervisor case in SAMPLE.
Phase: Evidence
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6e — pivot parity proof
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: none — evidence-only
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 H6e — Confirm pivot parity; run `PYTHONPATH=src python - <<'PY'\nfrom nanobrag_torch.config import DetectorConfig, DetectorConvention\nconfig = DetectorConfig(spixels=2463, fpixels=2527, pixel_size_mm=0.172, distance_mm=231.274660, detector_convention=DetectorConvention.CUSTOM, beam_center_s=213.907080, beam_center_f=217.742295, pix0_override_m=(-216.336293/1000, 215.205512/1000, -230.200866/1000), custom_fdet_vector=(0.999982, -0.005998, -0.000118), custom_sdet_vector=(-0.005998, -0.999970, -0.004913), custom_odet_vector=(-0.000088, 0.004914, -0.999988), custom_beam_vector=(0.00051387949, 0.0, -0.99999986))\nprint(config.detector_pivot)\nPY` and summarise alongside the C trace message in the artifact.
If Blocked: Record pivot evidence attempt (command + stderr) in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/attempts.log and flag in Attempts History before proceeding.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:136 — custom vectors force CUSTOM convention; document how C treats pivot.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:109 — pivot determination checklist to cite in parity memo.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:130 — Phase H6e freshly added; this memo executes that row.
- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Next Actions now require pivot proof before implementation.
How-To Map:
- Extract C evidence: `grep -n "pivoting" reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/c_trace/trace_c_pix0.log >> reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md`.
- Run the inline Python snippet above (use PYTHONPATH=src) and append output with context to the same markdown.
- In the artifact, note that SAMPLE pivot message appears in C while the Python snippet reports DetectorPivot.BEAM.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify source files yet; this loop is evidence-only.
- Keep PYTHONPATH pointing at src so the editable build is used.

  3. Phase H6g — rerun the PyTorch trace harness and nb-compare smoke to verify |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before closing H6; archive artifacts under `phase_h6/post_fix/` and record Attempt #39 in this ledger.
  4. Once pivot and pix0 parity are confirmed, resume Phase K2 — regenerate the scaling chain with the updated traces (`phase_k/f_latt_fix/trace_py_after.log`) and refresh `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`.

  6. Do not advance to Phase L until these artifacts land; keep normalization blocked on the refreshed traces.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A-H complete; polarization Phase I pending)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase C2 parity run exposed a 2.58e2× intensity scaling mismatch (PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 vs C max_I≈4.46e2). Phase D3/E diagnostics (2025-10-16) confirm three blocking geometry gaps: (a) PyTorch applies the raw `-pix0_vector_mm` override without the CUSTOM transform used in C (1.14 mm Y error); (b) CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, leaving the incident ray at the convention default `[0,0,1]`; (c) `-mat A.mat` handling discards the MOSFLM orientation, so Crystal falls back to canonical upper-triangular vectors while C uses the supplied A*. Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.
- Next Actions (2025-10-26 refresh): With H6c completed and the unit-only divergence documented, focus on correcting the pivot mismatch before resuming normalization work:
  1. Phase H6e — capture explicit pivot evidence: cite the SAMPLE pivot message in `trace_c_pix0.log`, record the current PyTorch configuration (`DetectorConfig.from_cli_args(...).detector_pivot`) showing BEAM, and summarise the mismatch in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md` plus `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`.

Summary: Enforce SAMPLE pivot for custom detector vectors and tidy parity artifacts.
Phase: Implementation
Focus: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6f — custom-vector SAMPLE pivot
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPivotSelection::test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md; reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pytest_pivot_fix.log
Do Now: CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase H6f — move the Phase H6 parity PNG/JPEGs under reports, add "'`tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPivotSelection::test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot`, then run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPivotSelection::test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot -v`
If Blocked: Capture the failing command + traceback in reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix_attempt.log and leave Attempts History note before trying alternatives.
Priorities & Rationale:
- docs/fix_plan.md:457 — Next action now demands H6f pivot enforcement before normalization resumes.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:130 — Phase H6f checklist defines regression test + artifact expectations.
- docs/architecture/detector.md:51 — Pivot formulas; must flip to SAMPLE when custom vectors exist.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md:§3.4 — CLI precedence for custom geometry + pix0 overrides.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md — Evidence you just gathered; closing the gap depends on this change.
How-To Map:
- Relocate `img*_*.png`, `intimage_*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg` into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` and update references in `pivot_parity.md` + `phase_h5/parity_summary.md`.
- Update `DetectorConfig.__post_init__` (or `from_cli_args`) to force SAMPLE pivot whenever any custom detector vectors or pix0 override is supplied; cite C reference lines and keep device/dtype neutrality.
- Add regression `TestCLIPivotSelection.test_custom_vectors_force_sample_pivot` covering: default BEAM, explicit SAMPLE override, and custom vectors forcing SAMPLE (cpu+cuda parametrization if feasible without blowing runtime).
- Log implementation decisions in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_fix.md` and stash pytest output at `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pytest_pivot_fix.log`.
- After tests pass, refresh trace via `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/trace_py.log` for use in H6g (do not diff yet, just capture).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not drop the custom-vector precedence guard that skips pix0 override within BEAM mode.
- Keep tensors on caller device/dtype; no hard-coded `.cpu()` or float64 literals.
- Respect Evidence vs Implementation boundary: tests must run only after code changes staged.
- Maintain Protected Assets: leave docs/index.md, loop.sh, supervisor.sh untouched except via plans.
- Avoid re-running full test suite; stay scoped to targeted pytest + added trace harness.
- Do not overwrite existing reports; create new files or append with timestamps.
- Ensure new test skips or parametrizes when CUDA unavailable instead of failing.
- Preserve existing Attempt numbering in docs/fix_plan.md when logging outcomes.
- Keep `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` in environment for any PyTorch execution.
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md#cli-flags-003-handle-nonoise-and-pix0_vector_mm
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md#phase-h6--pix0-divergence-isolation
- docs/architecture/detector.md:51
- specs/spec-a-cli.md

Next Up: H6g trace/nb-compare verification once SAMPLE pivot parity holds.

- "'`git pull --rebase` clean; reviewed CLI parity backlog vs long-term goal #1 and vectorization plan status (no edits required yet).
- Deep dive on pix0 gap: Phase H6 evidence confirms C forces SAMPLE pivot when custom vectors are supplied; PyTorch still defaults to BEAM. Normalization remains blocked until pivot + lattice parity close.
- Coin flip → heads: inspected Ralph’s last two commits (`5d0a34d`, `0b7eaf7`). Evidence quality is solid, but parity visuals landed in repo root (`img*_*.png`, `intimage*.jpeg`, `noiseimage_preview.jpeg`) — flagged for relocation into reports before further work.
- Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions for CLI-FLAGS-003 to mark H6e done, add H6f-prep cleanup, and call H6f/H6g/H6 progressions (Attempt #40 reserved for post-fix evidence).
- Issued new implementation memo (`input.md`) directing Ralph to move the stray images under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, enforce SAMPLE pivot selection in `DetectorConfig`, add a targeted regression test, rerun focused pytest, and capture post-fix trace output for H6g.

**Composing comprehensive final summary**

I'm preparing a detailed, friendly summary covering Step 1 analysis, Step 2 review, and Step 3 decisions. I'll include hypotheses ranked by confidence on the pivot issue with evidence and next steps, feedback on Ralph’s past work with root-level artifact references, notes on updates to fix_plan and input, a mention that the vectorization plan remains unchanged, document references with approximate line numbers, and clear next steps for Ralph—all formatted with bullet points for clarity.
[2025-10-06T19:32:53] codex

- Reworked the CLI parity TODOs now that H6e evidence landed: `docs/fix_plan.md:455` spells out the new H6f-prep cleanup (move parity PNG/JPEGs into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`), keeps H6f SAMPLE-pivot enforcement front and centre, and rolls H6g/K2/K3 forward with Attempt #40 reserved for the post-fix evidence.
- Logged this loop in `galph_memory.md` and issued a fresh Implementation-phase memo in `input.md` directing Ralph to (1) relocate the stray images, (2) force SAMPLE pivot whenever custom vectors or pix0 overrides appear, (3) add the targeted regression test, and (4) capture the follow-up trace run.

Deep analysis vs long-term goals
- CLI parity (Goal #1): Remaining blocker for the supervisor command is the SAMPLE vs BEAM pivot mismatch. Phase H6 evidence shows C emits “pivoting detector around sample” while `DetectorConfig.__post_init__` still defaults to BEAM when custom vectors are present (`src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:245`). Without alignment, pix0 deltas (~1.14 mm) keep F_latt off by 2–3 orders of magnitude (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md`).
- Vectorization (Goal #2): `plans/active/vectorization.md` already captures the tricubic→absorption roadmap; nothing new to unblock yet, but Phase A baseline capture remains a prerequisite before Ralph touches the interpolation kernels.

Debugging hypotheses (ranked)
1. **Custom-vector pivot rule missing (high confidence)** — Evidence: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/pivot_parity.md` vs `trace_c_pix0.log`; `DetectorConfig` never flips to SAMPLE. *Next confirming step:* implement the SAMPLE pivot forcing in H6f and rerun the targeted pytest/trace harness.
2. **SAMPLE pipeline still using BEAM-derived distances (medium)** — After pivot enforcement, verify `Detector._configure_geometry` uses `close_distance_mm` when SAMPLE is selected; mismatched `distance_corrected` could keep pix0 ~0.1 mm off. *Next step:* inspect the SAMPLE branch once H6f lands, ensure `close_distance_mm` propagates, and recalc pix0.
3. **Residual lattice factor drift (medium-low)** — Even with correct pivot, Phase K lattice normalization must be rerun; prior evidence (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_j/scaling_chain.md`) tags `F_latt` as first divergence. *Next step:* after H6f/H6g, redo the scaling trace (K2) to confirm the sincg updates eliminate the intensity jump.

Coin-flip review (heads)
- Latest Ralph commits `5d0a34d` and `0b7eaf7` delivered solid evidence packs but dropped eight large PNG/JPEG artifacts in repo root; we’re having him corral those into `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/` before coding. Otherwise the documentation updates and trace analysis look good.

Next steps for Ralph
1. Execute `input.md` (H6f): move the images, enforce SAMPLE pivot selection, add the regression test, run the targeted pytest, and capture the post-fix trace. Update Attempts History accordingly.
2. Pause for supervisor review before tackling H6g; no additional work authorised until the new evidence is in place.
