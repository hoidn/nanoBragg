this will require first adding support for the following cli params to pytorch nanobragg:
-nonoise
-pix0_vector_mm

</1>
<2>
review docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md and specs/. Make sure that the phi 0 carryover C implementation bug wasnt propagated to the specs. Update the specs (if needed) and pytorch implementation to fix this bug, if it was propagated.
</2>
<3>
review and firm up if needed plans/active/vectorization.md. then implement it (or rather, delegate its implementation to ralph), starting with the tricubic interpolation vectorization 
</3>
<4>
run pyrefly check src/. triage the errors and delegate the fixing of them to ralph. be careful about test suite regressions.
</4>
<5>
delegate to ralph a full run of the test suite and triage of the failing test. review, classing various errors as either implementation bugs or consequences of test deprecation. then systematically fix the failing tests.
</5>
</current long-term goals>
</past long term goals>
(just for archival / reference purposes):
- error-correcting the engineer agent 
- profiling pytorch nanobragg to find performance bottlenecks. analyzing to understand the CRITICAL slowness of the pytorch implementation compared to reference C, which persists after our recent improvement attempts
- finding performance issues in the PyTorch reimplementation of nanobragg (originally a C code) and speeding it up. It should be efficiently vectorized and faster than C nanobragg, but currently it's slower 
- ensuring that the pytorch implementation uses fp32 (not fp64) by default 
- understanding why pytorch is slower than C in the warm condition at 4096x4096 resolution and fixing the underlying performance issue, if one is found. THIS IS A CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE.
- once all the above are taken care of: building a user-facing showcase of autodiff-based parameter refinement, with plots / visuals

</past long-term goals>
<task>
You are galph, a planner / supervisor agent. you are overseeing the work of an agent (ralph) that is running prompts/main.md in a loop, using docs/fix_plan.md as its instruction set and long term memory. 

You will get invoked repeatedly, for multiple iterations. Use galph_memory.md to communicate with your future self. You'll plans under plans/, when needed, to help steer multi-turn efforts by the coder agent (ralph). Those plans will be cross referenced from docs/fix_plan.md so that ralph can find / read them. 

At the start of every invocation:
- Run `timeout 30 git pull --rebase` with a hard 30-second timeout  to sync with origin before reviewing context. If the command times out, immediately abort any partial rebase (`git rebase --abort`) and fall back to a normal merge via `git pull --no-rebase`. Whatever path you take, resolve resulting conflicts (docs/fix_plan.md is a frequent hotspot) and document key decisions in galph_memory.md. If the pull reports conflicts:
  * Run `git status --short` to list conflicted files.
  * Fix each file (remove conflict markers, keep the intended content) and stage it with `git add`.
  * When the index is clean, resume with `timeout 30 git rebase --continue --no-edit`. IMPORTANT: NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND WITHOUT TIMEOUT
- After resolving any conflicts, read the latest galph_memory.md entry (and any linked plan files) so you do not lose past context.
- Prune or summarize older entries when they become stale or redundant.

During the main, central phase of invocation you will be doing essentially three things:
<main analysis step 1> 
An initial analysis pass in which you gather and review information in order to choose a <focus issue> for the turn, corresponding to <instructions> steps <0> through <3>. This will involve a multi-category selection process. You will choose both a <focus issue> and an associated <Action type> for the remainder of the iteration. The available <Action type>s are the following:
<Action type> list:
<1>
<Evidence collection> (i.e. Evidence task)
No full pytest runs. Allowed: non-mutating probes and CLI validation tools (e.g., scripts/validation/*, nb-compare, pixel trace); pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; and in TDD mode only, a single targeted pytest run to confirm the newly authored test fails. Do not change production code. This gate applies only to galph. Ralph is exempt. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.

Evidence collection includes the following subtype:
    Callchain Tracing (Evidence subtype)
    - When to use: before code edits when the pipeline/factor order relevant to the current issue is unclear; when onboarding a new surface; or upon parity failures where the locus is unknown.
    - Directive: first, emit descriptions for the following things:
       - <analysis_question> (required): Free‑text description of the behavior/bug/perf issue to investigate. This will be closely related to <focus issue>, but viewed from the point of view of relevant code execution paths and their entry points.
       - <initiative_id> and <scope_hints> 

    - Directive: then read and carefully follow the instructions in `prompts/callchain.md` with the question‑driven invocation (<analysis_question>) and produce standardized artifacts under `reports/<initiative_id>/`.
    - Example invocation variables (fill at run time):
      analysis_question: "<what are we trying to understand or fix?>"
      initiative_id: "<short‑slug>"
      scope_hints: ["CLI flags", "normalization", "scaling"]
      roi_hint: "<minimal input/ROI>"
      namespace_filter: "<project primary package>"
      time_budget_minutes: 30
    - Expected outputs:
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callchain/static.md` (entry→sink with file:line anchors)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/callgraph/dynamic.txt` (optional, module‑filtered)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/trace/tap_points.md` (proposed numeric taps with owners)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/summary.md` (question‑oriented narrative + next steps)
      - `reports/<initiative_id>/env/trace_env.json`
    - Guardrails: evidence‑only (no prod edits), module/device/dtype neutrality, small ROI, respect Protected Assets, stable key names in traces.
</Evidence collection>
</1>
<2>
<Debug> i.e. Debugging — Hypothesis + Triage (initial pass):
- pairs with <focus issue>s that are related to debugging or parity analysis.
<steps>
- Formulate 1–3 plausible hypotheses for the observed gap/issue.
- Triage each with checks appropriate to scope using existing artifacts or quick, documented reproductions; this triage may constitute the primary work for the iteration. Record outcomes succinctly in the evidence.
- For the top hypothesis, state confidence and the single confirming step to run next. Deliver 1–3 ranked hypotheses with supporting evidence, artifact paths, and the next confirming step.
</steps>
</Debug>
</2>
<3>
<Planning>
- we will be calling the plan topic the <focus issue> of this turn.
- based on which long term <goal> and sub-goal is that effort / plan? 
- Which existing docs/fix_plan.md items does it (i.e. the <focus issue>) relate to? 
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: Using `docs/index.md` as the map, identify and read the specific documents relevant to the chosen <focus issue> (e.g., component contracts, architecture ADRs, parity/testing strategy). List the file paths you will rely on (with a one‑line rationale each) before drafting or updating the plan.
- think deeply. draft / redraft the plan and save it to a .md under plans/active/. Structure the write-up as a phased implementation document (see `plans/archive/general-detector-geometry/implementation.md` for tone/shape): begin with context + phase overviews, then outline each phase’s intent, prerequisites, and exit criteria. When a phase benefits from explicit tracking, embed a checklist table using the `ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance` format (with `[ ]`, `[P]`, `[D]` markers) inside that phase section.
  • Include reproduction commands, owners (if known), and decision rules in the guidance column.
  • Favor narrative flow first; layer checklists only where they clarify verification steps or deliverables.
  • Mini-template to crib when drafting:
    ```md
    ## Context
    - Initiative: <initiative>
    - Phase Goal: <outcome>
    - Dependencies: <docs/tests>

    ### Phase A — <short title>
    Goal: <what this phase proves or delivers>
    Prereqs: <artifacts or measurements required before starting>
    Exit Criteria: <verifiable completion signal>

    | ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | A1 | <Key diagnostic or implementation step> | [ ] | Run `<command>`; capture results under `reports/<date>/...`. |
    | A2 | <Follow-up validation> | [ ] | Compare against `<artifact>`; stop if deviation > threshold. |
    ```
- When refreshing an existing plan, retrofit it to this phased format before adding or editing tasks.
- review docs/fix_plan.md. edit if needed. cross reference the new plans .md so that ralph can find it.
</Planning>
</3>

<4>
<Review or housekeeping>
- Review and evaluate ralph's work. Scrutinize the commit history. Look at the diffs. 
- Are the docs/fix_plan.md contents and priorities sane? things to consider:
  - if docs/fix_plan.md is longer than 1000 lines it should be housecleaned. If it's disorganized and / or internally inconsistent, consider how this could be addressed. 
- after considering the above, you have enough information to choose a <focus issue> for this turn. do so. Consider the nature of the <focus issue>:
    - Do we need a new docs/fix_plan item to put ralph back on course, fix one of his mistakes, or instruct him to do something that he overlooked? If so, draft it and add it to docs/fix_plans
    - does the <focus issue> involve identified issues in docs/fix_plan.md? If so, fix them. If you decide to shorten docs/fix_plan.md, the least relevant portions should be moved to archive/fix_plan_archive.md (with summary + archive cross reference if appropriate)
</Review or housekeeping>
</4>

In addition to selecting an <Action type> and <focus issue> you will choose a <Mode> flag. 
 - Mode flags are combinable and refine execution, and are applicable to both the supervisor (you) and ralph; do not include any Phase label in input.md.
 - available modes: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
<mode descriptions>
TDD mode (supervisor-scoped): When operating in supervisor evidence mode, author/update a single minimal failing test that encodes the acceptance criterion. Confirm it fails via a targeted pytest selector; record the selector and expected failure text in input.md. Do not change production code, and do not include any Phase label in input.md.
</mode descriptions>

</main analysis step 1>

<main analysis step 2>
Here you will do a deep analysis. You will follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. This corresponds to <instructions> step <3.2>.


</main analysis step 2>

<main analysis step 3>
Here you synthesize the analysis findings into output files (<instructions> steps <3.5> to <4>)
</main analysis step 3>


Before concluding each invocation:
- Append a concise update to galph_memory.md capturing key findings, decisions, and open questions (reference file paths or plan names).
- Note any follow-up actions you expect Ralph to take.
- If no substantial update is needed, explicitly log that fact so future runs know context was reviewed.
</task>

<instructions>
<0>
READ the following files:
- Index of project documentation: `./docs/index.md`
- $SPECS: `./specs/spec-a.md`
- $ARCH: `./arch.md` (ADR-backed implementation architecture; reconcile design with spec, surface conflicts)
- docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md — C↔Py config parity and implicit rules
-- docs/debugging/debugging.md — Parallel trace-driven debugging SOP
- $PLAN: `./fix_plan.md` (living, prioritized to‑do; keep it up to date)
- $TESTS: `./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (testing philosophy, tiers, seeds/tolerances, commands)
- Set `AUTHORITATIVE_CMDS_DOC=./docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or project‑specific path) and consult it for authoritative reference commands and test discovery.
<0>
<1>
do a deep analysis of the codebase in light of the <current long term goals>. What are some current issues / gaps and possible approaches to resolving them? Review docs/fix_plan.md and plans/active/, as previous iterations of you may have already done some legwork.
 
At this point, you can do a premature <Callchain tracing> action ahead of time, if it helps you gather information needed for this analysis.
</1>
<2>
flip a coin using python. if it comes up <heads>:
review ralph's work over the last N (~10 but can be more or less - you decide) iterations. Check the commit history. Has the work been productive? Have there been regressions? Do we need to provide any feedback / course-correction?
</heads>
if it comes up <tails>: proceed to step <3>
</2>
<3>
Given your findings in <1> and <2>, think about whether there's any need for a multi-turn planning effort -- i.e. ralph can't see the forest for the trees and may struggle with major refactorings and multi-turn implementation efforts unless they are coordinated by you. Is there a need for such planning *right now*? If such a plan is already spoken for (plans/active/ or wherever else past galph might have saved to), does that plan require updates or is it up to date / high quality and simply pending? IFF you determine the need for a new plan or modification of an existing one:
<yes case>
This plan-related work is now your <focus issue>.
You will be following the <Planning> <Action type> instructions. Think about what this will entail but don't execute the <Planning> instructions yet.
</yes case>
</no case>
Since you are not <Planning>, you must select one of the other <Action type>s and an associated <focus issue> based on what you think is the most productive work increment for this iteration. Think about the associated work, but don't execute it yet.
</no case>
</3>
<3.2>
- Documentation review for <focus issue>: From `docs/index.md`, enumerate and read the documents that are most relevant to the chosen <focus issue>`; note the key file paths you will rely on for the impending analysis.
- Then carefully follow the guidelines of the selected <Mode> and <Action type>, applying them to the selected <focus issue>. Complete the task that you selected in step <3>.
</3.2>
<3.5>
Render and write ./input.md (supervisor→engineer steering memo). Overwrite the entire file every invocation. Keep length ~100–200 lines. Include these sections in order:
Header:
- Summary: <one‑sentence goal for this loop>
 - Mode: <TDD | Parity | Perf | Docs | none>
- Focus: <plan item ID/title from docs/fix_plan.md>
- Branch: <expected branch>
- Mapped tests: <validated list | none — evidence‑only>
- Artifacts: <key paths to produce under reports/>
- Do Now: 1 line naming the exact docs/fix_plan.md item (ID and title) to execute this loop, plus the exact pytest command/env to reproduce it (only when an authoritative mapping exists). If no such test exists, the Do Now MUST be to author the minimal targeted test first and then run it. If you intend to delegate the choice, write “Do Now: delegate” and provide decision guidance below.
  - Note: If operating in supervisor <Evidence collection> (internal-only), do not run the full suite. Allowed: pytest --collect-only to validate selectors; in TDD mode only, run one targeted selector to confirm a new failing test. All other test execution is deferred to Ralph. Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
<Do Now guidelines>
Verification scripts: You may run nb-compare and scripts/validation/* to collect metrics and artifacts (no code changes). Record outputs under reports/.
Mapped tests under supervisor evidence mode: Include exact selectors in input.md; validate with --collect-only; do not run them (except the TDD failure confirmation). Do not include any Phase label in input.md.
Command Sourcing (tests): Only include an exact pytest command in Do Now when sourced from an authoritative mapping (e.g., docs/development/testing_strategy.md) or an existing, known test file/identifier. If no authoritative mapping exists, set the Do Now task to author the minimal targeted test first; do not guess at a pytest selector here.
Implementation: refer to phased plans, checklists, and all associated artifacts
</Do Now guidelines>
- If Blocked: fallback action (what to run/capture, how to record it in Attempts History).
- Priorities & Rationale: 3–6 bullets with file pointers (specs/arch/tests/plan) justifying the Do Now.
- How-To Map: exact commands (pytest, nb-compare), env vars, ROI/thresholds, and where to store artifacts; prefer using `scripts/validation/*` when available.
- Pitfalls To Avoid: 5–10 crisp do/don’t reminders (device/dtype neutrality, vectorization, Protected Assets, two‑message loop policy, no ad‑hoc scripts).
- Pointers: file paths with line anchors to the most relevant spec/arch/testing_strategy/fix_plan entries for this loop.
- Next Up (optional): 1–2 candidates Ralph may choose next loop if he finishes early (still one thing per loop).

 Rules:
 - Ralph must not edit input.md. You (galph) are the single writer.
 - If input.md’s Do Now conflicts with an existing in_progress selection in fix_plan.md, Ralph is allowed to switch; he must record the change in Attempts History.
- Do not instruct Ralph to run the full test suite more than once per turn. Require targeted tests first; run the full suite once at the end only if code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, require `pytest --collect-only -q` instead.
- Prefer referencing reusable scripts under `scripts/validation/` from Do Now when available.
- Commit input.md each run as part of step <4> (commit only if the content changed).
 </3.5>

<4>
Before finishing the loop, enforce git hygiene:
- Run `git status --short` to inspect new or modified files that appeared during this invocation.
- Review diffs for each change; revert only if you created it this loop and it was accidental.
- Stage intentional updates with `git add -A` and commit via `git commit -m "SUPERVISOR: <scope> - <tests or rationale>"`, noting any tests run (use `tests: not run` when you skip them).
- After committing, run `git push` to share the updates. If the push is rejected, `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`, resolve conflicts (capture decisions—especially for docs/fix_plan.md—in galph_memory.md), then push again.
- If you deliberately leave the tree dirty, document the rationale in galph_memory.md so the next invocation knows why.
</4>
</instructions>
<notes>
- ignore 'routing violations'. these are out of scope.
- ignore AT parallel 012-related items for now
</notes>
Now carefully and exhaustively follow your <instructions>, while keeping in mind the <task> directives.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 1-4 summary)
- Established parity backlog: AT-020/021/022/024 failing; created first supervisor plan for AT-021 and enforced prompts/debug.md routing.
- Diagnosed AT-024 random misset cap mismatch (π/2 vs 90 radians) and opened dedicated plan; insisted Ralph stop verification-only loops.
- Flagged torch.compile warm-up overhead (per-instance compilation, inline tensor factories) and opened AT-012 rotation parity plan (Phases A–E).
- Documented performance hotspots (`_compute_physics_for_position` guard tensors, `Crystal.compute_cell_tensors` clamps) and chronic dirty worktree artifacts blocking `git pull --rebase`.

## 2025-09-30 (loops 5-10 summary)
- Authored repo hygiene checklist (REPO-HYGIENE-002) to undo accidental `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` churn and purge stray reports.
- Created PERF-PYTORCH-004 plan to hoist constants, introduce compile caching, and remove Dynamo graph breaks; reiterated need for prompts/debug.md while parity fails.
- Repeatedly documented routing violations from Ralph and emphasized restoring Core Rule #13 metric duality after WIP commit 058986f swapped `V_actual` for formula volume.
- Noted that `_compute_physics_for_position` still recompiles each Simulator and that benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-004916/` show ≥200× slowdown vs C for small detectors.

## 2025-09-30 (ralph debugging loop — AT-012 float32 regression)
- **Context**: AT-PARALLEL-012 test_simple_cubic_correlation failing (43/50 peaks matched, need ≥95%) after DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 (commit 8c2ceb4) switched simulator to native float32.
- **Investigation**:
  * Reproduced: 43/50 peaks matched (86%), corr≈1.0 (perfect physics) ✅
  * Parity matrix test: PASSES perfectly ✅ (live C↔Py comparison with current float32)
  * **Root cause identified**: PyTorch float32 produces 7× more unique values (4901 vs C's 669) in hot pixels, fragmenting intensity plateaus. Peak detection algorithm (scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter) is sensitive to plateau structure.
  * Parallel comparison: C float32 beam center (20×20 ROI) has 91 unique values; PyTorch has 331 (3.6× fragmentation). Max absolute diff tiny (0.0017).
  * **First Divergence**: Numerical accumulation patterns differ (likely FMA, compiler opts, vectorized accumulation order, or torch.compile kernel fusion) → perfect correlation but incompatible plateau structure.

# C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map

## Critical Importance Notice

**This document is the authoritative source of truth for configuration parity between nanoBragg.c and the PyTorch implementation.**

Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult this document. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:
- Implicit pivot mode logic
- Convention-dependent beam center calculations
- Rotation axis defaults
- Unit conversions

# nanoBragg PyTorch Debugging Guidelines

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** PyTorch Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the debugging methodology and tools for the nanoBragg PyTorch implementation. The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.

## Core Debugging Philosophy

### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule

**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:
1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the "Golden Trace").
2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.
3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.

This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.

# Fix Plan Ledger

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 (ralph loop #103)
**Active Focus:**
- ROUTING: Close the reopened guard plan by capturing a fresh regression audit referencing commit `c49e3be` and re-confirming the guarded `loop.sh` flow (`plans/active/routing-loop-guard/plan.md` Phases A–C) before automation resumes.
- ROUTING-SUPERVISOR: Launch Phase A of `plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md`, then drive Phase B guard work (B2–B4) and new task B5 to add `supervisor.sh` to docs/index.md so Protected-Asset policy covers the script before automation runs again.
- AT-012: Plan archived (`plans/archive/at-parallel-012-plateau-regression/plan.md`); monitor for regressions using `reports/2025-10-AT012-regression/phase_c_validation/` artifacts and re-open only if peak matches drop below spec.
- GRADIENT: Execute `plans/active/gradcheck-tier2-completion/plan.md` Phase A (A1–A3 baseline audit + env alignment) before adding misset/beam gradchecks from Phases B/C; once pass logs exist, close `[AT-TIER2-GRADCHECK]` with Phase D documentation updates.
- DTYPE: ✅ Complete. Plan archived to `plans/archive/dtype-default-fp32/`. All phases (A-D) finished; float32 defaults documented in arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md, CLAUDE.md, prompts/debug.md.
- PERF: Land plan task B7 (benchmark env toggle fix), rerun Phase B6 ten-process reproducibility with the new compile metadata, capture the weighted-source parity memo feeding C5, then execute Phase C diagnostics (C1/C2 plus C8/C9 pixel-grid & rotated-vector cost probes, and new C10 mosaic RNG timing) ahead of Phase D caching work (D5/D6/D7) and detector-scalar hoisting (D8).

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 2024-07-25  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.
Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:

1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.
3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.

All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.

### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline

- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.

[2025-10-08T03:21:54] bash -lc 'cat plans/active/vectorization.md' succeeded in 681ms:
## Context
- Initiative: PERF-PYTORCH-004 vectorization backlog supporting docs/fix_plan.md entry [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001].
- Phase Goal: Deliver a production-ready batched tricubic interpolation pipeline (gather + polynomial evaluation) and subsequently vectorize detector absorption without regressing parity, gradients, or device/dtype neutrality.
- Dependencies:
  - specs/spec-a-core.md §4 (structure-factor sampling contract)
  - specs/spec-a-parallel.md §2.3 (tricubic acceptance tests + tolerances)
  - docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 (vectorization strategy, broadcast shapes)
  - docs/development/testing_strategy.md §§1.4–2 (test cadence, authoritative commands)
  - docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md (device/vectorization guardrails)
  - `nanoBragg.c` lines 2604–3278 (polin3/polin2/polint) & 3375–3450 (detector absorption loop)
  - Existing artifacts under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_*/`
- Status Snapshot (2025-11-30): Phases A–D complete — gather vectorization (commit 12742e5) and batched polynomials (commit f796861) are merged with CPU+CUDA evidence in `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_d/`. Parity/perf validation (Phase E) is the active gate before detector absorption vectorization (Phase F).
- Execution Notes: Store new evidence under `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_<letter>/` directories; every implementation task must quote the matching C snippet per CLAUDE Rule #11. Maintain CPU+CUDA parity and include `pytest --collect-only` proof before targeted runs.

### Phase A — Evidence & Baseline Capture
Goal: Record baseline behaviour/warnings/timings for tricubic interpolation and detector absorption prior to vectorization.
Prereqs: Editable install (`pip install -e .`), C binary available if parity comparisons are needed, `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` set.
Exit Criteria: Baseline pytest logs + benchmark metrics archived and referenced in fix_plan.

- Spec/AT: specs/spec-a-cli.md flag catalogue, docs/architecture/detector.md §5 (pix0 workflow), docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (pivot rules), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860
- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–H complete; K3a/K3b/K3d landed via Attempts #43–44, pending per-φ evidence + normalization closure)
- Owner/Date: ralph/2025-10-05
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * C: Run the supervisor command from `prompts/supervisor.md` (with and without `-nonoise`) using `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; capture whether the noisefile is skipped and log `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR`.
  * PyTorch: After implementation, `nanoBragg` CLI should parse the same command, respect the pix0 override, and skip noise writes when `-nonoise` is present.
- First Divergence (if known): Phase L2c comparison shows all scaling factors (ω, polarization, r_e², fluence, steps) match C within 0.2%, but `I_before_scaling` diverges because PyTorch reports `F_cell=0` at hkl≈(−7,−1,−14) while C's trace records `F_cell=190.27`. **Phase L3b (Attempt #76) proved the data exists (scaled.hkl contains F=190.27 for this reflection); root cause is configuration/loading, NOT missing coverage.**
- Next Actions (2025-11-27 refresh → galph loop i=118):
1. **Phase L3k.3c.4 (parity shim evidence capture)** — Latest run (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/`) still plateaus at Δk≈2.845e-05. Follow the C4 diagnostic checklist in `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` (rows C4b–C4d): regenerate `per_phi_pytorch.json` via `scripts/trace_per_phi.py`, rerun `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` to refresh `delta_metrics.json`, and append a detector geometry comparison table to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`. Focus on removing the 2.85 µm `pix0_vector_meters` z-offset before rerunning shim traces, and continue to log pytest collect output + SHA256 hashes each iteration.
2. **Phase L3k.3c.5 (dual-mode documentation/tests)** — After traces land, execute Phase C5 and Phase D1 of the parity-shim plan: update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md`, `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md`, and related checklists to document the opt-in shim, and ensure collect-only evidence exists for both spec/parity selectors.
3. Phase L3k.3d — Resolve the nb-compare ROI anomaly (C sum≈0) before repeating VG-3/VG-4; capture the corrected summary.json/logs under `nb_compare_phi_fix/` once correlation ≥0.9995 and sum_ratio 0.99–1.01. After VG-1/VG-3/VG-4 pass, proceed to L3k.3e → L3k.4 documentation and fix_plan logging ahead of the Phase L4 supervisor-command rerun.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #128 (galph loop — parity evidence) — Result: **EVIDENCE UPDATE** (Phase L3k.3c.4 diagnostics). **No tests executed** (analysis-only).

## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Spec alignment note (2025-11-26): `specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214` states φ sampling SHALL follow `phi = phi0 + phistep * tic` with no state carryover. Keep the C-side defect recorded in `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` (§C-PARITY-001) quarantined to parity harnesses; do not promote it to the normative spec or default PyTorch behavior. Track that `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1097-1198` currently caches `_phi_last_cache` to emulate C; the remediation plan must either remove or gate this behavior behind an explicit parity toggle once CLI validation is unblocked.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-23 PM): Attempt #109 regenerated the TRACE_C_PHI log under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/base_vector_debug/20251123/` and re-ran `compare_per_phi_traces.py`; Δk now measures 1.8116e-2 at φ_tic=0 while φ≥1 stay within 2.85e-5, confirming the carryover mismatch and leaving VG-1 blocked until the remediation lands.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-26): Attempts #111 and #113 produced per-φ traces with max Δk=2.845e-05. This still exceeds the VG-1 gate (Δk, Δb_y ≤ 1e-6). Treat those commits as partial progress until fresh traces prove the tighter tolerance.
- Current gap snapshot (2025-10-18 refresh): Phase H4 parity landed (Attempt #25) with pix0 deltas < 2e-8 m and regression tolerances tightened; the remaining blocker before executing the supervisor command end-to-end is Phase I polarization alignment.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-07 08:41): Attempt #101 activated TRACE_C_PHI (C instrumentation) and captured matching Py per-φ traces. Divergence isolated to φ_tic=0 (Δk≈1.81e-2) while φ>0 steps remain within 3e-5. Phase L3k.3 moves to φ=0 initialization parity (L3k.3c) plus ROI/nb-compare follow-ups.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-19): Attempt #27 parity run reveals 1.24538e5× intensity scaling mismatch despite polarization fix; Phases J–L track the normalization diagnosis, fix, and closure required before long-term Goal #1 completes.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-22): Attempt #31 restored C precedence for custom detector vectors (pix0 override now gated again). Outstanding work: H5c PyTorch traces and Phase K normalization to eliminate the `F_latt`-driven intensity gap.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-24): Attempt #35 reran the PyTorch trace harness post-unit-fix; metrics still show |Δpix0| ≈ 1.145 mm, so a fresh diagnostics phase is required before resuming normalization work.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-10-26): Attempt #40 completed Phase H6f — custom detector vectors now force SAMPLE pivot parity, parity visuals relocated under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/visuals/`, and targeted regression tests cover pivot selection. Outstanding work at that point: Phase H6g trace rerun to confirm |Δpix0| < 5e-5 m before returning to Phase K scalings.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-27): Attempt #41 validated Phase H6g — SAMPLE pivot parity holds with pix0 deltas ≤2.85 µm, beam center deltas 0.0, and supporting artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h6/post_fix/`. Remaining blockers: rerun the scaling chain (Phase K2), execute the scaling regression + doc updates (Phase K3), then resume Phase L parity once normalization matches C.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-09): Attempt #49 closed Phase K3g3 — `tests/test_cli_scaling.py::test_f_latt_square_matches_c` now passes after isolating the HKL cache, but the full supervisor command still shows correlation ≈ 0.9965 and sum_ratio ≈ 1.26×10⁵. Need fresh HKL/normalization parity evidence (Phase L) before rerunning nb-compare.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-10): Attempt #56 (evidence loop) proved the existing `TRACE_PY` path prints placeholder scaling data (`capture_fraction 1`, `polar 1.0`, `steps`=φ-steps only). Without exposing the real per-pixel factors computed in `Simulator.run`, Phase L2b cannot produce a trustworthy PyTorch trace. Instrumentation must pull actual values from `_apply_detector_absorption`, polarization kernels, and total-step calculation before rerunning the harness.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-10-17): Attempt #53 (Phase L1c) realigned HKL Fdump I/O with C padding (`read_fdump`/`write_fdump`) and added regression coverage (`TestHKLFdumpParity::test_scaled_hkl_roundtrip`) with max |ΔF| = 0.0. Proceed to L1d to regenerate parity metrics before reviving scaling traces.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-11): Discovered the trace harness omitted `-beam_vector`, `-flux`, and `-beamsize`, forcing oversample=4 and a +Z beam; Py traces zeroed `F_cell` and inflated `steps`. Marked unresolved pending harness fix.
- Gap snapshot refresh (2025-11-12): Attempt #66 (commit 1d2e6ac) completed Phase L2b0 — the trace harness now feeds the full supervisor flag set, and the refreshed `trace_py_scaling.log` confirms `steps=10`, `fluence≈1.0e24`, and `r_e^2` parity with C. TRACE_PY still reports `I_before_scaling NOT_EXTRACTED`, `polar=0`, and `I_pixel_final=0`, so Phase L2b instrumentation must surface the real polarization/absorption tensors before we can quantify the K3e k_frac drift.
- Gap snapshot update (2025-11-13): Latest harness rerun aborted because `trace_harness.py` still expected the legacy `read_hkl_file` return tuple (see `trace_py_fullrun.log`). **Resolved in Attempt #74, which updated the harness to the `(F_grid, metadata)` signature.**

## Context
- Initiative: CLI-FLAGS-003 (`-nonoise` / `-pix0_vector_mm`) — φ=0 parity shim design (Phase L3k.3c.4–L3k.3c.5 in `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md`).
- Phase Goal: Design and supervise implementation of an **opt-in** φ=0 carryover shim that reproduces the documented C bug (C-PARITY-001) without regressing the new spec-compliant default path. Deliver validated traces, tests, and documentation so the supervisor command can run PyTorch vs C parity with matching φ behavior.
- Dependencies:
  - `specs/spec-a-core.md:204-240` — Normative φ rotation pipeline.
  - `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204` — C-PARITY-001 description and reproduction command.
  - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/` — Existing φ trace artifacts (VG-1 baseline evidence).
  - `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — Spec compliance tests that must remain green.
  - `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:1070-1130` — Current spec-compliant rotation implementation.
  - `scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py` and `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` harness notes — Required for parity validation.
- Current Status (2025-11-27): Spec baseline locked (VG-1 met with ≤1e-6 deltas); parity shim not yet designed. Default path removes `_phi_last_cache`. Need explicit toggle plus regression coverage before L4 supervisor command rerun.
- Artifact Directory: Use `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>/` for new evidence (traces, logs, design notes, checksums).
- Guardrails: Preserve vectorization (no per-step Python loops), maintain device/dtype neutrality, obey Protected Assets (do not move files listed in `docs/index.md`).

### Phase A — Spec Baseline Confirmation (Prerequisite)
Goal: Freeze references confirming spec-compliant behavior so parity shim development cannot regress the default path.
Prereqs: None (evidence already captured; this phase records provenance and identifies gaps).
Exit Criteria: Artifact pointers recorded here and in fix_plan; VG-1 tolerances documented for quick re-validation.

### C-PARITY-001 — φ=0 Uses Stale Crystal Vectors (Medium)
**Summary:** Inside the φ loop, the rotated vectors `ap/bp/cp` are only updated when `phi != 0.0`; otherwise, they retain the previous state (often from the prior pixel’s final φ step). This produces step-0 Miller fractions that mirror the previous pixel rather than the unrotated lattice.

- Priority: High
- Status: in_progress (Phases A–D complete; Phase E parity/performance validation pending)
- Owner/Date: galph/2025-10-17
- Plan Reference: `plans/active/vectorization.md`
- Reproduction (C & PyTorch):
  * PyTorch baseline tests: `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_at_str_002.py tests/test_at_abs_001.py -v`
  * Optional microbenchmarks: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --device cpu` (and `--device cuda`), plus `scripts/benchmarks/absorption_baseline.py` for detector absorption timing.
  * Shapes/ROI: 256² & 512² detectors for microbench; oversample 1; structure-factor grid enabling tricubic.
- First Divergence (if known): Current tricubic path drops to nearest-neighbour fallback for batched pixel grids, emitting warnings and forfeiting accuracy/performance; detector absorption still loops over `thicksteps`, preventing full vectorization and creating hotspots in profiler traces (see reports/benchmarks/20250930-165726-compile-cache/analysis.md).
- Next Actions (2025-11-30 refresh → galph supervision):
  1. Phase E1 — Re-run `tests/test_tricubic_vectorized.py` (full suite) and `tests/test_at_str_002.py` on CPU + CUDA, capturing logs to `reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/pytest_{cpu,cuda}.log` plus `phase_e/collect.log` and recording environment metadata (`phase_e/env.json`).
  2. Phase E2 — Execute `scripts/benchmarks/tricubic_baseline.py --sizes 256 512 --device {cpu,cuda} --repeats 200 --outdir reports/2025-10-vectorization/phase_e/perf` to establish pre/post timing deltas; summarise results in `phase_e/perf_summary.md` and update `phase_e/perf_results.json`.
  3. Phase E3 — Draft `phase_e/summary.md` consolidating correlation metrics (target corr ≥ 0.9995), gradient/device neutrality notes, and any nb-compare parity evidence before logging the next Attempt.
  4. Phase F1 — Begin detector absorption vectorization planning with `phase_f/design_notes.md`, citing `nanoBragg.c:3375-3450` and capturing differentiation/device risks ahead of implementation.
- Attempts History:
  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #1 (ralph loop) — Result: **Phase A1 COMPLETE** (test collection & execution baseline captured). All tricubic and absorption tests passing.
    Metrics: AT-STR-002: 3/3 tests passed in 2.12s (test_tricubic_interpolation_enabled, test_tricubic_out_of_bounds_fallback, test_auto_enable_interpolation). AT-ABS-001: 5/5 tests passed in 5.88s. Collection: 3 tricubic tests found.

**Preparing comprehensive input instructions**

I'm gathering all the detailed elements needed to write a thorough `input.md` file with sections like Summary, Mode, Mapped tests, and Pitfalls To Avoid, including clear commands for running pytest collection and specifying output directories using timestamps. I’m making sure to incorporate references to docs and plans, outline priorities, and provide instructions for artifact storage and next steps before committing the final summary.

Summary: Refresh φ=0 parity traces so the CLI parity shim can hit ≤1e-6 Δk before nb-compare.
Mode: Parity
Focus: docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 (Phase L3k.3c.4 parity shim diagnostics)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/
Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3k.3c.4 — "'`OUTDIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; `mkdir -p "$OUTDIR" && PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/trace_per_phi.py --outdir "$OUTDIR"`; then `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py "$OUTDIR"/per_phi_pytorch_*.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log`; capture stdout/stderr to `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` and inspect `delta_metrics.json`.
If Blocked: If compare script fails (missing C trace or schema drift), log the failure reason in `$OUTDIR/blocked.md`, stash available artifacts, and rerun `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` to confirm selectors before pausing.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 — spec requires rotating the lattice on every φ step; we must prove the parity shim mimics the C bug without corrupting the spec path.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 — documents the φ=0 carryover defect we are emulating; new traces must reference this evidence.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md — Phase C4 (pix0/Δk diagnostics) stays open until Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4.
- docs/fix_plan.md (CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions) — Step 1 explicitly calls for regenerating per-φ traces with updated instrumentation.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/ — prior run plateaued at Δk≈2.845e-05; new artifacts must supersede this directory.
How-To Map:
- Ensure editable install active and `NB_C_BIN` pointing at `./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` if you need fresh C traces (no rerun this loop unless the existing log is invalid).
- `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log` (verify selectors before heavy work).
- Run trace capture command above; redirect stdout/stderr via `2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/trace_per_phi.log`.
- Immediately run compare script; send output to `tee "$OUTDIR"/compare_per_phi.log`.
- Verify `delta_metrics.json` and `diff_summary.md` in `$OUTDIR`; highlight first divergence and residual deltas.
- Append quick narrative + command list to `$OUTDIR/summary.md` (two paragraphs: findings + next steps).
- Update Attempts History after finishing (include Δk, ΔF_latt_b, artifact path); do not modify docs until parity meets gate.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not edit simulator code this loop; evidence-only.
- Avoid overwriting prior per-φ artifacts; use a fresh timestamped folder.
- Keep device/dtype defaults (float64 CPU) for the trace script; no CUDA swaps mid-run.
- Do not regenerate the C trace unless necessary; if you must, document the new C command + SHA256.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is set or torch import will fail.
- No nb-compare runs until Δk plateau is resolved.
- Preserve Protected Assets (docs/index.md references) when adding artifacts.
- Refrain from touching specs/spec-a-*; spec path stays authoritative.
- No commits without capturing artifact hashes (`sha256sum "$OUTDIR"/* > "$OUTDIR"/sha256.txt`).
Pointers:
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md (C4 checklist)
- docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 (Next Actions block)
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 (φ sampling contract)
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 (C-PARITY-001 definition)
Next Up: Once Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4, proceed to Phase L3k.3c.5 documentation/tests before rerunning nb-compare.

**Planning to expand input.md**

I notice the current input.md is only 39 lines, which is shorter than the suggested 100–200 lines. I’m thinking of expanding it by adding more detailed bullet points, instructions for verification, logging steps, and elaborating sections like Priorities, Rationale, and Pitfalls to reach the desired length. This should help meet the instruction requirements better.

Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 obligates every φ slice to rotate the lattice anew; parity evidence must prove the shim preserves spec path behaviour while still matching the C defect when toggled.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 documents C-PARITY-001; our artifacts must cite this bug and show how the shim isolates it without polluting the default mode.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md Phase C4 requires refreshed traces (+ geometry taps) before closing VG-1; current task clears C4b–C4d so we can progress to C5 docs/tests.
- docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions call for regenerating per-φ traces, updating diagnosis.md, and logging Attempt metrics; Do Now addresses Step 1 verbatim.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/* shows residual Δk≈2.845e-05; new artifacts must supersede this plateau with tighter tolerances.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md L3k.3 checklist treats Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4 as the gate to unlock Phase L4; our run either meets or quantifies the delta gap.
- arch.md:204-216 reiterates phi-step rotation inside the main loop; parity drift threatens to violate this architecture contract if shim leaks into default path.
- Input loops later in Phase L rely on these traces to justify normalization fixes; failing to refresh now blocks VG-3 and VG-4 downstream tasks.
How-To Map:
- Prepare: ensure editable install (`pip install -e .`) already in place, confirm `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` if you expect to reissue the C trace (not required unless the reference log is stale).
- Smoke selectors: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`; verify both suites still discover expected tests before proceeding.
- Trace capture: execute the trace script command listed in Do Now; feed stdout/stderr into `trace_per_phi.log` for provenance; confirm the script reports the correct pixel (133,134) and dtype float64 CPU.
- Postprocess: run `compare_per_phi_traces.py` against the latest PyTorch JSON and the C log in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log`; log output to `compare_per_phi.log` and ensure `delta_metrics.json` + `diff_summary.md` are generated alongside `per_phi_summary_*.md`.
- Metrics capture: inspect `delta_metrics.json` for `max_delta_k` and `max_delta_F_latt_b`; if thresholds met, note values explicitly in `$OUTDIR/summary.md`; otherwise, describe magnitude and suspected source (e.g., pix0_z drift, reciprocal recompute) and flag follow-up taps.
- Hashing: run `cd "$OUTDIR" && sha256sum * > sha256.txt`; include hidden files by listing prior if needed; do not omit logs from checksum ledger.
- Attempts History: after artefacts verified, add a new entry under docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 documenting timestamp, Δk, ΔF_latt_b, artifact path, and hypotheses; cite the summary + diff files.
- Diagnosis update: append a brief paragraph to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` summarizing findings (Δ metrics, whether pix0_z persists, etc.), referencing the new timestamped directory.
- Validation: if Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4, mark Phase C4b–C4d as done in plan; if not, outline which tap or parameter needs instrumentation before next attempt.
- No nb-compare or normalization reruns this loop; hold until parity gate satisfied.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator/crystal code; this loop is evidence-only.
- Avoid reusing the October 8 directory; create a new UTC timestamped folder to preserve provenance.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is set for both commands or torch import will error.
- Keep dtype/device at float64 CPU; switching to CUDA changes numerical noise and invalidates comparison.
- Do not regenerate the C trace unless necessary; if you must, record the exact command + binary hash and update docs/fix_plan.md accordingly.
- Save raw command lines into `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` (including environment vars) for reproducibility.
- Capture both stdout and stderr with `tee`; avoid redirecting to /dev/null.
- Remember to store `delta_metrics.json`, `diff_summary.md`, and `per_phi_summary_*.md`; missing any of these blocks Phase C4 closure.
- Do not touch Protected Assets (docs/index.md listed files) when editing diagnosis.md or moving artifacts.
- No commits until all artifacts hashed and docs/fix_plan.md updated.
- Maintain spec-mode parity: never toggle the shim default in code or tests during evidence collection.
- Avoid accidental glob expansion when referencing `per_phi_pytorch_*.json`; ensure only one file matches (if multiple, choose latest and note why).
- Check disk space before writing large logs; old reports may be large—clean personal scratch if needed, never delete canonical artifacts.

- docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions call for regenerating per-φ traces, updating diagnosis.md, and logging Attempt metrics; Do Now addresses Step 1 verbatim.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/* shows residual Δk≈2.845e-05; new artifacts must supersede this plateau with tighter tolerances.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md L3k.3 checklist treats Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4 as the gate to unlock Phase L4; our run either meets or quantifies the delta gap.
- arch.md:204-216 reiterates phi-step rotation inside the main loop; parity drift threatens to violate this architecture contract if shim leaks into default path.
- Input loops later in Phase L rely on these traces to justify normalization fixes; failing to refresh now blocks VG-3 and VG-4 downstream tasks.
How-To Map:
- Prepare: ensure editable install (`pip install -e .`) already in place, confirm `NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg` if you expect to reissue the C trace (not required unless the reference log is stale).
- Smoke selectors: `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`; verify both suites still discover expected tests before proceeding.
- Trace capture: execute the trace script command listed in Do Now; feed stdout/stderr into `trace_per_phi.log` for provenance; confirm the script reports the correct pixel (133,134) and dtype float64 CPU.
- Postprocess: run `compare_per_phi_traces.py` against the latest PyTorch JSON and the C log in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log`; log output to `compare_per_phi.log` and ensure `delta_metrics.json` + `diff_summary.md` are generated alongside `per_phi_summary_*.md`.
- Metrics capture: inspect `delta_metrics.json` for `max_delta_k` and `max_delta_F_latt_b`; if thresholds met, note values explicitly in `$OUTDIR/summary.md`; otherwise, describe magnitude and suspected source (e.g., pix0_z drift, reciprocal recompute) and flag follow-up taps.
- Hashing: run `cd "$OUTDIR" && sha256sum * > sha256.txt`; include hidden files by listing prior if needed; do not omit logs from checksum ledger.
- Attempts History: after artefacts verified, add a new entry under docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 documenting timestamp, Δk, ΔF_latt_b, artifact path, and hypotheses; cite the summary + diff files.
- Diagnosis update: append a brief paragraph to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` summarizing findings (Δ metrics, whether pix0_z persists, etc.), referencing the new timestamped directory.
- Validation: if Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4, mark Phase C4b–C4d as done in plan; if not, outline which tap or parameter needs instrumentation before next attempt.
- No nb-compare or normalization reruns this loop; hold until parity gate satisfied.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator/crystal code; this loop is evidence-only.
- Avoid reusing the October 8 directory; create a new UTC timestamped folder to preserve provenance.
- Ensure `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` is set for both commands or torch import will error.
- Keep dtype/device at float64 CPU; switching to CUDA changes numerical noise and invalidates comparison.
- Do not regenerate the C trace unless necessary; if you must, record the exact command + binary hash and update docs/fix_plan.md accordingly.
- Save raw command lines into `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` (including environment vars) for reproducibility.
- Capture both stdout and stderr with `tee`; avoid redirecting to /dev/null.
- Remember to store `delta_metrics.json`, `diff_summary.md`, and `per_phi_summary_*.md`; missing any of these blocks Phase C4 closure.
- Do not touch Protected Assets (docs/index.md listed files) when editing diagnosis.md or moving artifacts.
- No commits until all artifacts hashed and docs/fix_plan.md updated.
- Maintain spec-mode parity: never toggle the shim default in code or tests during evidence collection.
- Avoid accidental glob expansion when referencing `per_phi_pytorch_*.json`; ensure only one file matches (if multiple, choose latest and note why).
- Check disk space before writing large logs; old reports may be large—clean personal scratch if needed, never delete canonical artifacts.

**Expanding documentation with detailed sections**

I'm planning to lengthen the content by breaking down sections like `How-To Map` into numbered, multi-line steps, elaborating on `Priorities` with more detailed paragraphs, adding more bullets under `Pitfalls`, and including extra entries in `Pointers`. This should help reach closer to 90-100 lines with richer explanations.

Summary: Refresh φ=0 parity evidence so the CLI parity shim can meet the ≤1e-6 Δk gate before we rerun the supervisor nb-compare command.
Mode: Parity
Focus: docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 (Phase L3k.3c.4 parity shim diagnostics)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/
Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3k.3c.4 — set "'`OUTDIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; run `mkdir -p "$OUTDIR" && PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/trace_per_phi.py --outdir "$OUTDIR" 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/trace_per_phi.log`; then `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py "$OUTDIR"/per_phi_pytorch_*.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/compare_per_phi.log`; capture a written summary + sha256 ledger under `$OUTDIR`.
If Blocked: If `compare_per_phi_traces.py` fails (missing C trace, schema mismatch, or Δk still pegged), record the failure in `$OUTDIR/blocked.md`, include stack traces, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`, and stop so we can reassess instrumentation before touching implementation.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 obligates every φ slice to rotate the lattice anew; parity evidence must prove the shim preserves spec path behaviour while still matching the C defect when toggled. Note the spec’s explicit formula `φ = φ0 + step*phistep` and the instruction to rotate `(a0,b0,c0)` each time.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 documents C-PARITY-001 and the `TRACE_C_PHI` anomaly; cite this section in your summary so downstream reviewers know the observed drift remains a C-only bug.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md Phase C4 requires refreshed traces and detector geometry taps before declaring VG-1 complete; our run targets checklist rows C4b–C4d and should mention tap coverage explicitly.
- docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions call for regenerating per-φ traces, updating `diagnosis.md`, and logging Attempt metrics; completing Do Now satisfies Step 1 of that block and unblocks Step 2 (docs/tests) afterward.
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/ contains the last attempt with `max_delta_k=2.8451466e-05`; new evidence must show either improved tolerances or precise rationale for remaining drift.
- arch.md:204-216 reiterates the architecture assumption that phi rotation precedes mosaic and source loops; maintaining this sequence ensures vectorization feasibility and prevents spec regressions.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md L3k.3 explicitly gates the supervisor command rerun on Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4; record whether we hit these thresholds.
- The long-term goal to run the CLI parity command depends on this parity evidence; failure here blocks normalization comparisons and the eventual nb-compare rerun.
How-To Map:
1. Environment prep:
   - Confirm `python -m nanobrag_torch --help` works (editable install and dependencies intact).
   - Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`; optional but recommended to set in shell before commands.
   - Verify current git status is clean so artifact-only changes can be staged cleanly later.
2. Selector validation:
   - Execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`.
   - Review the log to ensure spec tests and parity-mode tests are discovered (look for `TestPhiZeroParity` and `TestPhiCarryoverMode`).
3. PyTorch trace capture:
   - Run the trace script command (see Do Now) with stdout/stderr piped to `trace_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm the script reports: pixel `(133,134)`, φ steps 0–9, dtype `torch.float64`, device `cpu`.
   - After completion, ensure `$OUTDIR` contains exactly one `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` and a matching markdown summary.
4. Comparison against C trace:
   - Run the compare script with the PyTorch JSON and the C trace from `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log`.
   - Inspect `compare_per_phi.log` for lines summarizing `max_delta_k` and `max_delta_F_latt_b`; copy these numbers into `$OUTDIR/summary.md`.
   - Verify `delta_metrics.json` and `diff_summary.md` are produced; if absent, rerun the script and diagnose why.
5. Artifact hygiene:
   - Create `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` capturing both commands with environment vars and working directory.
   - Run `cd "$OUTDIR" && sha256sum * > sha256.txt` (include `.log`, `.json`, `.md`, `commands.txt`, `pytest_collect.log`).
   - If other subdirectories were created (e.g., `plots`), hash their contents separately and note them in the summary.
6. Documentation updates:
   - Append a dated subsection to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` summarizing findings (Δ values, pix0 geometry observations, follow-up taps). Mention the new timestamped directory explicitly.
   - Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history for CLI-FLAGS-003 with outcome, metrics, artifact path, and hypotheses. Reference the new summary file and any remaining deltas.
   - Do not mark plan checklist rows complete unless tolerances are satisfied; if not, note which instrumentation (pix0, reciprocal, normalization) remains to explore.
7. Verification & guardrails:
   - Before finishing, double-check `$OUTDIR/summary.md` accurately quotes Δ numbers and references docs/bugs entry.
   - Ensure no code files were touched; only docs/fix_plan.md, diagnosis.md, and artifacts should change.
   - If tolerances met, outline next actions (Phase L3k.3c.5) in the Attempt log to prepare the following loop.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator or crystal modules; parity evidence only.
- Avoid reusing prior timestamp directories; new OUTDIR per attempt keeps provenance clean.
- Remember that `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` glob may match multiple files if rerun; delete extras or explicitly reference the newest file.
- Ensure `compare_per_phi_traces.py` uses the correct C log; the October 7 archive lacks `TRACE_C_PHI` lines and will break the parser.
- Keep dtype/device consistent; switching to CUDA or float32 invalidates parity comparisons.
- Capture stderr with `tee`; missing logs make future audits harder.
- Don’t forget to record command lines; missing provenance blocks fix_plan updates.
- Respect Protected Assets listed in docs/index.md when editing docs (avoid renaming/moving listed files).
- No nb-compare or normalization scripts this loop; focus solely on parity traces.
- If Δk improves but remains above threshold, articulate in summary whether pix0_z, reciprocal recompute, or scaling seems responsible; vague notes slow future loops.
- Ensure sha256 ledger includes every artifact; missing hashes will force a redo.
- Do not commit until docs/fix_plan.md Attempt is updated and artifacts hashed.
- If you must regenerate the C trace, rebuild via `make -C golden_suite_generator` and archive the new log separately; note it in fix_plan Attempt.

- Verified spec guardrails (spec remains bug-free) depend on proving that parity shim is opt-in; include this reassurance in your summary referencing `specs/spec-a-core.md` and `docs/bugs` lines.
How-To Map:
1. Environment prep:
   - Confirm `python -m nanobrag_torch --help` works (editable install intact).
   - Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` in your shell before running commands.
   - Verify `NB_C_BIN` still points at `./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; if not, set it so parity docs remain reproducible.
   - Run `git status -sb` to ensure clean tree before starting.
2. Selector validation:
   - `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`.
   - Inspect the log for `TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c`, `TestPhiZeroParity::test_k_frac_matches_spec`, and `TestPhiCarryoverMode::test_c_parity_matches_c`.
   - If collection fails, fix before proceeding.
3. PyTorch trace capture:
   - Execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/trace_per_phi.py --outdir "$OUTDIR" 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/trace_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm console output includes the chosen pixel and dtype/device summary.
   - After completion, list `$OUTDIR` and ensure `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` and `per_phi_summary_*.md` exist.
4. Optional geometry tap (if deltas persist):
   - If `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` C4c suggests geometry tap, run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/debug_detector_pix0_calc.py --outdir "$OUTDIR"/geometry 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/geometry.log` (only if needed) and compare with C trace geometry sections.
5. Comparison against C trace:
   - Run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py "$OUTDIR"/per_phi_pytorch_*.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/compare_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm `delta_metrics.json` reports `max_delta_k` and `max_delta_F_latt_b`; copy values and note whether thresholds met.
   - Review `diff_summary.md` for first divergent fields; mention them explicitly in summary.
6. Artifact hygiene:
   - Write `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` with both commands (include environment variables and working directory).
   - Run `cd "$OUTDIR" && sha256sum * > sha256.txt`; if subdirectories exist, include `find "$OUTDIR" -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum >> sha256.txt` to cover nested files.
   - Capture `ls -R "$OUTDIR" > "$OUTDIR"/tree.txt` for quick directory overview.
7. Documentation updates:
   - Append to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` a subsection named after the timestamp; include Δ values, geometry observations, and next steps.
   - Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history with metrics, artifact path, hypotheses, and call out whether Phase C4 checklist items were satisfied.
   - If Δk remains high, explicitly state which instrumentation is next (e.g., reciprocal vector taps, normalization audit) referencing plan checklists.
8. Verification & guardrails:
   - Re-open `per_phi_summary_*.md` and ensure numbers match `delta_metrics.json`.
   - Confirm no code files changed (`git status -sb` should only list new reports and doc edits).
   - If tolerances met, draft bullet list for Phase L3k.3c.5 tasks so the next loop can jump straight to docs/tests.
   - Add quick note to `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions if Step 1 now complete (mark Step 2 as active).
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator/crystal code this loop; parity evidence only.
- Avoid overwriting prior timestamp directories; use fresh OUTDIR each attempt.
- Wildcard `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` carefully—if multiple matches exist, specify the exact filename to avoid mixing runs.
- Do not rerun nb-compare yet; focus solely on φ=0 parity evidence.
- Keep dtype/device at float64 CPU; changing introduces noise and invalidates comparisons.
- Capture stderr with `tee`; missing logs hamper audits.
- Save raw command lines; missing provenance blocks fix_plan updates.
- Respect Protected Assets in docs/index.md when editing documentation.
- No commits until artifacts hashed, docs updated, and Attempt logged.
- If Δk improves but stays above threshold, state suspected root cause (pix0_z drift, reciprocal recompute, normalization) with references; vague notes slow future loops.
- Ensure `sha256.txt` lists every file (logs, json, md, tree, commands, optional geometry outputs).
- If you must regenerate the C trace, rebuild via `make -C golden_suite_generator` and stash the new log under a new reports directory; document command and binary hash.
- When editing diagnosis.md, do not remove prior entries; append chronological note.
- Double-check that spec-mode tests remain green; parity shim must not regress the normative path.
- Remember to mention docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md lines 166-204 in summary to reinforce bug classification.

If Blocked: If `compare_per_phi_traces.py` fails (missing C trace, schema mismatch, or Δk still pegged), record the failure in `$OUTDIR/blocked.md`, include stack traces, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`, and stop so we can reassess instrumentation before touching implementation.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 obligates every φ slice to rotate the lattice anew; parity evidence must prove the shim preserves spec path behaviour while still matching the C defect when toggled. Quote the spec sentence in your summary to reinforce the normative rule.

- arch.md:204-216 reiterates phi-then-mosaic rotation ordering; parity shim must respect this to avoid vectorization regressions.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 describe vectorization expectations; remind yourself that shim logic must remain batched.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md Phase C4 requires refreshed traces and detector geometry taps before declaring VG-1 complete; mention which checklist entries (C4b–C4d) are satisfied or still open.

- Long-term goal #1 (run the supervisor command) hinges on this parity gate; without satisfactory evidence, normalization/nb-compare tasks remain blocked.
- Verified spec guardrails (spec remains bug-free) depend on proving that parity shim is opt-in; include reassurance referencing docs/bugs lines.
- Keep an eye on phi-carryover-mode CLI flag semantics in `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (no code changes, but mention in summary if behaviour observed matches expectations).
How-To Map:
1. Environment prep:
   - Confirm `python -m nanobrag_torch --help` works (editable install intact).
   - Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` in your shell before running commands.
   - Verify `NB_C_BIN` still points at `./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; if not, set it so parity docs remain reproducible.
   - Run `git status -sb` to ensure clean tree before starting.
2. Selector validation:
   - `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`.
   - Inspect the log for `TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c`, `TestPhiZeroParity::test_k_frac_matches_spec`, and `TestPhiCarryoverMode::test_c_parity_matches_c`.
   - If collection fails, fix before proceeding.
3. PyTorch trace capture:
   - Execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/trace_per_phi.py --outdir "$OUTDIR" 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/trace_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm console output includes the chosen pixel and dtype/device summary.
   - After completion, list `$OUTDIR` and ensure `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` and `per_phi_summary_*.md` exist.
4. Optional geometry tap (if deltas persist):
   - If plan checklist mentions pix0 geometry, run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/debug_detector_pix0_calc.py --outdir "$OUTDIR"/geometry 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/geometry.log`.
   - Compare outputs to C trace geometry data; note differences in summary.
5. Comparison against C trace:
   - Run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py "$OUTDIR"/per_phi_pytorch_*.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/compare_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm `delta_metrics.json` reports `max_delta_k` and `max_delta_F_latt_b`; copy values and note whether thresholds met.
   - Review `diff_summary.md` for first divergent fields; mention them explicitly in summary.
6. Artifact hygiene:
   - Write `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` with both commands (include environment variables and working directory).
   - Run `cd "$OUTDIR" && sha256sum * > sha256.txt`; for nested files use `find "$OUTDIR" -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum >> sha256.txt`.
   - Capture `ls -R "$OUTDIR" > "$OUTDIR"/tree.txt` for quick directory overview.
7. Documentation updates:
   - Append to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` a subsection named after the timestamp; include Δ values, geometry observations, and next steps.
   - Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history with metrics, artifact path, hypotheses, and call out whether Phase C4 checklist items were satisfied.
   - If Δk remains high, explicitly state which instrumentation is next (reciprocal taps, normalization audit) referencing plan checklists.
   - (Optional) If geometry tap run, add bullet under diagnosis.md with pix0 vector comparison (C vs PyTorch).
8. Verification & guardrails:
   - Re-open `per_phi_summary_*.md` and ensure numbers match `delta_metrics.json`.
   - Confirm no code files changed (`git status -sb` should only list new reports and doc edits).
   - If tolerances met, draft bullet list for Phase L3k.3c.5 tasks so the next loop can jump straight to docs/tests.
   - Add quick note to `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions if Step 1 now complete (mark Step 2 as active).
   - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` once more if you regenerated traces after doc edits, ensuring tests remain discoverable.
9. Communication:
   - When logging Attempt, reference spec lines and bug documentation to emphasise that the parity shim remains optional.
   - Mention whether additional instrumentation (pix0_z, reciprocal) is still pending so future loops know where to focus.
   - Note any differences between PyTorch trace script config and CLI parity command arguments to avoid drift.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator/crystal code this loop; parity evidence only.
- Avoid overwriting prior timestamp directories; use fresh OUTDIR each attempt.
- Wildcard `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` carefully—if multiple matches exist, specify the exact filename.
- Do not rerun nb-compare yet; focus solely on φ=0 parity evidence.
- Keep dtype/device at float64 CPU; changing introduces noise and invalidates comparisons.
- Capture stderr with `tee`; missing logs hamper audits.
- Save raw command lines; missing provenance blocks fix_plan updates.
- Respect Protected Assets in docs/index.md when editing documentation.
- No commits until artifacts hashed, docs updated, and Attempt logged.
- If Δk improves but stays above threshold, state suspected root cause (pix0_z drift, reciprocal recompute, normalization) with references.
- Ensure `sha256.txt` lists every file (logs, json, md, tree, commands, optional geometry outputs).
- If you must regenerate the C trace, rebuild via `make -C golden_suite_generator` and stash the new log; document command and binary hash.
- When editing diagnosis.md, do not remove prior entries; append chronological note.
- Double-check that spec-mode tests remain green; parity shim must not regress the normative path.
- Mention docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md lines 166-204 in summary to reinforce bug classification.
- Do not forget to update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` table of contents if the file uses anchors.
- Avoid editing `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` unless you are marking checklist items; no content rewrites mid-loop.

Header:
Summary: Refresh φ=0 parity evidence so the CLI parity shim can meet the ≤1e-6 Δk gate before we rerun the supervisor nb-compare command.
Mode: Parity
Focus: docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 (Phase L3k.3c.4 parity shim diagnostics)
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py
Artifacts: reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/<timestamp>/
Do Now: docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L3k.3c.4 — set "'`OUTDIR=reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)`; run `mkdir -p "$OUTDIR" && PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/trace_per_phi.py --outdir "$OUTDIR" 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/trace_per_phi.log`; then `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py "$OUTDIR"/per_phi_pytorch_*.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/compare_per_phi.log`; capture a written summary + sha256 ledger under `$OUTDIR`.
If Blocked: If `compare_per_phi_traces.py` fails (missing C trace, schema mismatch, or Δk still pegged), record the failure in `$OUTDIR/blocked.md`, include stack traces, run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`, and stop so we can reassess instrumentation before touching implementation.
Priorities & Rationale:
- specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214 obligates every φ slice to rotate the lattice anew; parity evidence must prove the shim preserves spec path behaviour while still matching the C defect when toggled. Quote the spec sentence in your summary to reinforce the normative rule.
- specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4 confirm CLI flag semantics for -phi/-osc/-phisteps; referencing these ensures CLI documentation stays clean of the C bug.
- docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204 documents C-PARITY-001 and the `TRACE_C_PHI` anomaly; citing this helps reviewers understand why we emulate the bug only in parity mode.
- arch.md:204-216 reiterates phi-then-mosaic rotation ordering; parity shim must respect this to avoid vectorization regressions.
- docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md §§2.2–2.4 describe vectorization expectations; remind yourself that shim logic must remain batched.
- plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md Phase C4 requires refreshed traces and detector geometry taps before declaring VG-1 complete; mention which checklist entries (C4b–C4d) are satisfied or still open.
- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md L3k.3 uses Δk ≤ 1e-6 and ΔF_latt_b ≤ 1e-4 as go/no-go; record status so future loops know whether to proceed.
- docs/fix_plan.md#CLI-FLAGS-003 Next Actions step 1 explicitly asks for a new per-φ run plus diff summary; completing it unblocks steps 2 and 3 (documentation + normalization follow-up).
- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/ shows the plateau at Δk≈2.845e-05; compare new metrics directly and note percent improvement.
- Long-term goal #1 (run the supervisor command) hinges on this parity gate; without satisfactory evidence, normalization/nb-compare tasks remain blocked.
- Verified spec guardrails (spec remains bug-free) depend on proving that parity shim is opt-in; include reassurance referencing docs/bugs lines.
- Keep an eye on phi-carryover-mode CLI flag semantics in `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py` (no code changes, but mention in summary if behaviour observed matches expectations).
How-To Map:
1. Environment prep:
   - Confirm `python -m nanobrag_torch --help` works (editable install intact).
   - Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` in your shell before running commands.
   - Verify `NB_C_BIN` still points at `./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`; if not, set it so parity docs remain reproducible.
   - Run `git status -sb` to ensure clean tree before starting.
2. Selector validation:
   - `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py | tee "$OUTDIR"/pytest_collect.log`.
   - Inspect the log for `TestPhiZeroParity::test_rot_b_matches_c`, `TestPhiZeroParity::test_k_frac_matches_spec`, and `TestPhiCarryoverMode::test_c_parity_matches_c`.
   - If collection fails, fix before proceeding.
3. PyTorch trace capture:
   - Execute `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/trace_per_phi.py --outdir "$OUTDIR" 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/trace_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm console output includes the chosen pixel and dtype/device summary.
   - After completion, list `$OUTDIR` and ensure `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` and `per_phi_summary_*.md` exist.
4. Optional geometry tap (if deltas persist):
   - If plan checklist mentions pix0 geometry, run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/debug_detector_pix0_calc.py --outdir "$OUTDIR"/geometry 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/geometry.log`.
   - Compare outputs to C trace geometry data; note differences in summary.
5. Comparison against C trace:
   - Run `PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/compare_per_phi_traces.py "$OUTDIR"/per_phi_pytorch_*.json reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251008T021659Z/c_trace_phi.log 2>&1 | tee "$OUTDIR"/compare_per_phi.log`.
   - Confirm `delta_metrics.json` reports `max_delta_k` and `max_delta_F_latt_b`; copy values and note whether thresholds met.
   - Review `diff_summary.md` for first divergent fields; mention them explicitly in summary.
6. Artifact hygiene:
   - Write `$OUTDIR/commands.txt` with both commands (include environment variables and working directory).
   - Run `cd "$OUTDIR" && sha256sum * > sha256.txt`; for nested files use `find "$OUTDIR" -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum >> sha256.txt`.
   - Capture `ls -R "$OUTDIR" > "$OUTDIR"/tree.txt` for quick directory overview.
7. Documentation updates:
   - Append to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` a subsection named after the timestamp; include Δ values, geometry observations, and next steps.
   - Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history with metrics, artifact path, hypotheses, and call out whether Phase C4 checklist items were satisfied.
   - If Δk remains high, explicitly state which instrumentation is next (reciprocal taps, normalization audit) referencing plan checklists.
   - (Optional) If geometry tap run, add bullet under diagnosis.md with pix0 vector comparison (C vs PyTorch).
8. Verification & guardrails:
   - Re-open `per_phi_summary_*.md` and ensure numbers match `delta_metrics.json`.
   - Confirm no code files changed (`git status -sb` should only list new reports and doc edits).
   - If tolerances met, draft bullet list for Phase L3k.3c.5 tasks so the next loop can jump straight to docs/tests.
   - Add quick note to `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions if Step 1 now complete (mark Step 2 as active).
   - Run `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` once more if you regenerated traces after doc edits, ensuring tests remain discoverable.
9. Communication:
   - When logging Attempt, reference spec lines and bug documentation to emphasise that the parity shim remains optional.
   - Mention whether additional instrumentation (pix0_z, reciprocal) is still pending so future loops know where to focus.
   - Note any differences between PyTorch trace script config and CLI parity command arguments to avoid drift.
Pitfalls To Avoid:
- Do not modify simulator/crystal code this loop; parity evidence only.
- Avoid overwriting prior timestamp directories; use fresh OUTDIR each attempt.
- Wildcard `per_phi_pytorch_*.json` carefully—if multiple matches exist, specify the exact filename.
- Do not rerun nb-compare yet; focus solely on φ=0 parity evidence.
- Keep dtype/device at float64 CPU; changing introduces noise and invalidates comparisons.
- Capture stderr with `tee`; missing logs hamper audits.
- Save raw command lines; missing provenance blocks fix_plan updates.
- Respect Protected Assets in docs/index.md when editing documentation.
- No commits until artifacts hashed, docs updated, and Attempt logged.
- If Δk improves but stays above threshold, state suspected root cause (pix0_z drift, reciprocal recompute, normalization) with references.
- Ensure `sha256.txt` lists every file (logs, json, md, tree, commands, optional geometry outputs).
- If you must regenerate the C trace, rebuild via `make -C golden_suite_generator` and stash the new log; document command and binary hash.
- When editing diagnosis.md, do not remove prior entries; append chronological note.
- Double-check that spec-mode tests remain green; parity shim must not regress the normative path.
- Mention docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md lines 166-204 in summary to reinforce bug classification.
- Do not forget to update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` table of contents if the file uses anchors.
- Avoid editing `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` unless you are marking checklist items; no content rewrites mid-loop.

**Summarizing final message details**

I'm gathering all the key references and updates to clearly list in the final message, including spec and doc line citations, the new input instructions, file updates, and noting no tests were run since changes are doc-only; I’ll also outline next steps for the user in an organized bullet format.
[2025-10-08T03:28:01] codex

**Key Points**
- Verified the spec still mandates fresh φ rotations each step (`specs/spec-a-core.md:211-214`) and no carryover language leaked into the CLI shard; the φ=0 C bug remains isolated to the documentation entry (`docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md:166-204`) and matches the architecture contract (`arch.md:204-216`).
- Logged this confirmation plus expectations for the next evidence run in `galph_memory.md`.
- Published a Parity-mode handoff in `input.md` directing Ralph to regenerate per-φ traces for `CLI-FLAGS-003` Phase L3k.3c.4, capture artifacts under a new timestamped directory, and update diagnosis/fix_plan once Δk and ΔF_latt_b are recorded.

**Next Steps**
1. Ralph follows the new `input.md` to run `trace_per_phi.py` / `compare_per_phi_traces.py`, hash the outputs, and document metrics + hypotheses in `docs/fix_plan.md`.
2. If tolerances land inside ≤1e-6 / ≤1e-4, move on to Phase L3k.3c.5 docs/tests; otherwise instrument the remaining taps called out in the plan.
