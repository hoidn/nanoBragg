finishing it unblocks the rest of Phase H.\n    11→- docs/fix_plan.md:448 — Current Next Actions call out H2–H4; keeping docs aligned requires closing H2 first.\n    12→- src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:463 — Hard-coded MOSFLM/XDS defaults override CLI `-beam_vector`, producing the incident_vec divergence in Attempt #19; this is the root to fix.\n    13→- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_comparison.md — Evidence log shows beam mismatch cascading into wrong `hkl_frac` and `F_latt`; new traces must demonstrate the fix.\n    14→- arch.md:107 — Architecture contract demands Simulator incident beam direction match detector convention; CUSTOM overrides must survive to physics kernels.\n    15→- specs/spec-a-cli.md:58 — Spec confirms `-beam_vector` is part of the CUSTOM flag cluster; CLI parity fails until we honour that mapping end-to-end.\n    16→- specs/spec-a-parallel.md:265 — Selecting any custom vector forces CUSTOM convention; our implementation must keep that side effect intact post-fix.\n    17→- docs/development/testing_strategy.md:82 — Parallel trace SOP obligates before/after artifacts when closing parity gaps; tracing is not optional here.\n    18→- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/trace_summary_orientation_fixed.md — Orientation parity is already clean; the remaining delta isolates to beam/lattice, so H2 is the next logical lever.\n    19→- plans/active/vectorization.md:1 — Long-term goal #2 stays paused until CLI parity stabilises; completing H2 keeps vectorization work from being blocked by upstream physics bugs.\n    20→\n    21→Context Notes:\n    22→- Phase F2 already ports the CUSTOM pix0 transform; do not revisit that logic unless new evidence surfaces.\n    23→- MOSFLM orientation ingestion (Phase G2/G3) is confirmed; expect rotated lattice vectors to match C exactly before your changes.\n    24→- The supervisor command runs with BEAM pivot because distance is set; ensure this remains true post-fix.\n    25→- Oversample is forced to 1; if the simulator infers a different value, document and correct it before proceeding.\n    26→- The harness currently imports `scaled.hkl`; do not switch to `scaled.hkl.1` to avoid Protected Asset issues.\n    27→- Detector basis vectors come from CLI custom inputs; verify the simulator does not recompute them implicitly during the fix.\n    28→- Beam fluence/flux math is already validated; avoid touching scaling while debugging beam direction.\n    29→- Keep polarization disabled while testing to isolate lattice physics; log that choice in the summary.\n    30→- Check that `trace_pixel` remains `(1039, 685)` so parity compares the same pixel.\n    31→- After the fix, expect `incident_vec` to match C within 1e-9 per component; deviations beyond that hint at normalization slip.\n    32→- Document any temporary harness edits so they can be reverted or archived cleanly in later loops.\n    33→- Note that Attempt #19 already stored pre-fix traces; keep file names distinct to avoid confusion.\n    34→\n    35→How-To Map:\n    36→- Create output folders (`mkdir -p reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h`) so new logs do not overwrite Phase G artifacts.\n    37→- Update src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py to fetch `self.detector.beam_vector`, normalise it, and cache it as a tensor with the caller’s device/dtype; keep the old convention defaults as fallbacks when no detector is present.\n    38→- Ensure the beam vector pull happens before torch.compile invocation to avoid graph rebuilds; reuse existing cloning logic in `_compute_physics_for_position`.\n    39→- Add an inline helper (pure function) if needed to normalise the vector without introducing device churn; keep it private to simulator.py.\n    40→- Instrument the fix with lightweight asserts in the harness only (no production prints) to confirm the vector is length-one before/after.\n    41→- Refresh the trace harness: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_py_after_beam_fix.log 2>&1` and diff against the existing C trace (`diff -u reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_g/traces/trace_c.log reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_py_after_beam_fix.log > reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_diff_after_beam_fix.log`).\n    42→- Capture a short markdown summary (`reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/beam_fix_summary.md`) noting incident_vec, hkl_frac, and F_latt deltas before rerunning parity.\n    43→- Add a focused pytest in tests/test_cli_flags.py (e.g., class TestCLIBeamVector) that invokes the CLI parser, constructs Detector/Simulator, and asserts the simulator’s incident vector matches the CLI override; keep execution under one second.\n    44→- Run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIBeamVector::test_custom_beam_vector_propagates -v` and copy the log to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/pytest_beam_vector.log`.\n    45→- After tests, update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt history with artifact paths (`trace_py_after_beam_fix.log`, `trace_diff_after_beam_fix.log`, pytest log) and mark plan task H2 as [D] if criteria met.\n    46→- Leave polarization disabled during checks to isolate beam/lattice behaviour; document this in the summary so later phases know the conditions.\n    47→- Before finishing, stage only intentional files and keep prompts/debug.md untouched; mention any remaining dirty files in the Attempt note if they persist.\n    48→- Re-read plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md after edits to ensure Phase H guidance still matches the work being done.\n    49→- Prepare a brief note for Phase H3 describing any residual mismatches so the next loop can start quickly.\n    50→- Update reports index if new artifact filenames differ from previous conventions.\n    51→- Double-check that CLI argument parsing still routes custom beam vectors correctly by running the parser in isolation (`PYTHONPATH=src python - <<'PY' ...`).\n    52→\n    53→Verification Checklist:\n    54→- Confirm git diff for src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py only touches the beam-direction block and related helpers.\n    55→- Validate `trace_py_after_beam_fix.log` prints `TRACE_PY: incident_vec` matching the C log within tolerance.\n    56→- Ensure the new pytest fails pre-fix and passes post-fix (document the before/after result in the Attempt note).\n    57→- Check that docs/fix_plan.md gains a new Attempt with status + artifact list; no stale placeholders.\n    58→- Verify plan task H2 is toggled to `[D]` once evidence is archived.\n    59→- Confirm `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/beam_fix_summary.md` references all relevant artifacts with relative paths.\n    60→- Make sure no new files appear outside `reports/` and `tests/`; repo hygiene must stay intact.\n    61→- Run `pytest --collect-only -q` if pytest emits collection warnings; log any anomalies.\n    62→- Ensure timestamps in artifacts follow ISO-8601 or match existing naming conventions.\n    63→- Capture any outstanding TODOs for H3/H4 in the summary so supervision continuity holds.\n    64→\n    65→Pitfalls To Avoid:\n    66→- Do not reintroduce `.item()` or `.cpu()` inside compiled physics paths; keep tensors differentiable per Core Rule #9.\n    67→- Maintain device/dtype neutrality—source the beam vector on whatever device the detector currently uses.\n    68→- Avoid adding Python loops; keep the change purely tensor-based so vectorization is preserved.\n    69→- Preserve CUSTOM side effects: if any custom vector is provided, ensure convention stays CUSTOM and no implicit fallback occurs.\n    70→- Respect Protected Assets; never touch files referenced by docs/index.md.\n    71→- Run only the targeted pytest configured above; defer full test suites until the implementation loop that lands a fix.\n    72→- Keep trace harness modifications confined to reports/; production code must not gain debug prints.\n    73→- Ensure the new pytest uses `pytest.mark.parametrize` sparingly to avoid long runtimes; focus on the single supervisor configuration.\n    74→- Watch for normalization drift—unit test should assert `torch.allclose(norm, 1.0, atol=1e-6)`.\n    75→- Update plan + fix_plan promptly; stale coordination docs are considered regressions for supervisor loops.\n    76→- Do not delete or rename `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_*` directories; Protected Assets rule extends via docs/index.md references.\n    77→- Avoid editing scripts under `golden_suite_generator/` during this loop; scope is restricted to PyTorch parity.\n    78→- When writing new tests, import simulator via installed package path (`from nanobrag_torch import ...`) to mirror CLI usage.\n    79→- Avoid committing temporary harness prints;

This involves:\n    16→1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the \"Golden Trace\").\n    17→2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n    18→3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.\n    19→\n    20→This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.\n    21→\n    22→## Debugging Workflow (SOP-4.1)\n    23→\n    24→Follow the specialized PyTorch physics debugging process documented in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (see the Parallel Validation Matrix section):\n    25→\n    26→1. **Identify an On-Peak Pixel:** Run the PyTorch simulation and visually inspect the output image to find the coordinates of a bright pixel on a Bragg peak.\n    27→2. **Generate Golden C Trace:** Add trace printf statements to `nanoBragg.c` around the calculation of interest (e.g., detector geometry, scattering vectors). Recompile with `make -C golden_suite_generator` and run with your test parameters, redirecting stderr to capture the trace log.\n    28→3. **Generate PyTorch Trace:** Create a debug script (e.g., `scripts/debug_beam_pivot_trace.py`) that replicates the exact calculation with matching trace output format.\n    29→4. **Compare Traces:** Use a diff tool (`diff`, `vimdiff`, etc.) to compare the C trace and the PyTorch trace.\n    30→5. **Identify Divergence Point:** Find the first variable where the numerical values differ significantly.

Introduction & Philosophy\n     8→\n     9→This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.\n    10→Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:\n    11→\n    12→1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the \"ground truth\" specification.\n    13→2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.\n    14→3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.\n    15→\n    16→All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.\n    17→\n    18→### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline\n    19→\n    20→- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.\n    21→- **Authoritative smoke runs:** When a change touches tensor math, run the authoritative reproduction command once on CPU and once on CUDA (when available). Capture both logs/metrics and attach them to the fix plan. Treat any `torch.compile` or Dynamo warning about mixed devices as blocking.\n    22→- **Targeted tests:** Prefer parametrised tests that iterate over `device in {\"cpu\", \"cuda\"}` (guarded by `torch.cuda.is_available()`). At minimum, ensure a `gpu_smoke` marker or equivalent pytest node exercises the new logic on CUDA before declaring success.\n    23→- **Helper utilities:** Encapsulate device/dtype harmonisation in small helpers (e.g., `tensor.to(other_tensor)` or `type_as`). Centralise these helpers in reusable modules to keep the rule enforceable across future PyTorch projects.\n    24→- **CI gate:** If CI offers GPU runners, add a fast smoke job that runs the `gpu_smoke` marker (or agreed command) so regressions like CPU↔GPU tensor mixing fail quickly.\n    25→- **Vectorization check:** Confirm `_compute_physics_for_position` and related helpers remain batched across sources/phi/mosaic/oversample; extend broadcast dimensions instead of adding Python loops.\n    26→- **Runtime checklist:** Consult `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` during development and cite it in fix-plan notes for PyTorch changes.\n    27→\n    28→### 1.5 Loop Execution Notes (Do Now + Validation Scripts)\n    29→\n    30→- Do Now must include an exact pytest command: In the supervisor→engineer handoff (`input.md`), include the precise `pytest` node(s) that reproduce the active item. If no test exists, first author the minimal targeted test and then run it.\n    31→- Prefer reusable validation scripts: Place ad‑hoc validations under `scripts/validation/` and reference them from `input.md` rather than embedding Python snippets inline. Keep them portable and invoke via the project’s standard CLI/env.\n    32→- Test cadence per loop: Run targeted tests first; execute the full `pytest` suite at most once per engineer turn (end of loop) when code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, use `pytest --collect-only -q` to verify import/collection.\n    33→\n    34→## 2. Configuration Parity\n    35→\n    36→**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before implementing any test that compares against C-code output, you **MUST** ensure exact configuration parity. All golden test cases must be generated with commands that are verifiably equivalent to the PyTorch test configurations.\n    37→\n    38→**Authoritative Reference:** See the **[C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./c_to_pytorch_config_map.md)** for:\n    39→- Complete parameter mappings\n    40→- Implicit conventions (pivot modes, beam adjustments, rotation axes)\n    41→- Common configuration bugs and prevention strategies\n    42→\n    43→Configuration mismatches are the most common source of test failures. Always verify:\n    44→- Pivot mode (BEAM vs SAMPLE) based on parameter implications\n    45→- Convention-specific adjustments (e.g., MOSFLM's 0.5 pixel offset)\n    46→- Default rotation axes for each convention\n    47→- Proper unit conversions at boundaries\n    48→ - Explicit convention selection: tests and harnesses MUST pass `-convention` (or equivalent API flag) to avoid implicit CUSTOM switching when vector parameters are present\n    49→\n    50→\n    51→## 2.1 Ground Truth: Parallel Trace-Driven Validation\n    52→\n    53→The foundation of our testing strategy is a \"Golden Suite\" of test data. Crucially, final-output comparison is insufficient for effective debugging. Our strategy is therefore centered on **Parallel Trace-Driven Validation**.\n    54→\n    55→For each test case, the Golden Suite must contain three components:\n    56→1. **Golden Output Image:** The final .bin file from the C code.\n    57→2. **Golden C-Code Trace Log:** A detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the C code for a specific on-peak pixel.\n    58→3. **PyTorch Trace Log:** An identical, step-by-step log from the PyTorch implementation for the same pixel.\n    59→\n    60→This allows for direct, line-by-line comparison of the entire physics calculation, making it possible to pinpoint the exact line of code where a divergence occurs.\n    61→### 2.2 Instrumenting the C Code\n    62→\n    63→The `nanoBragg.c` source in `golden_suite_generator/` must be instrumented with a `-dump_pixel <slow> <fast>` command-line flag. When run with this flag, the program must write a detailed log file (`<test_case_name>_C_trace.log`) containing key intermediate variables (e.g., `scattering_vector`, `h`, `k`, `l`, `F_cell`, `F_latt`, `omega_pixel`, `polar`) for the specified pixel.

This single test validates the entire chain of component calculations.\n   370→\n   371→### 3.4 Integration Tests (`tests/test_simulator.py`)\n   372→\n   373→**Target:** The end-to-end `Simulator.run()` method.  \n   374→**Methodology:** For each test case, create a test that compares the final PyTorch image tensor against the golden `.bin` file using `torch.allclose`. This test should only be expected to pass after the Parallel Trace Comparison test passes.\n   375→\n   376→**Primary Validation Tool:** The main script for running end-to-end parallel validation against the C-code reference is `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py`. This script automates the execution of both the PyTorch and C implementations, generates comparison plots, and computes quantitative correlation metrics. It relies on `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` to manage the C-code execution.\n   377→\n   378→## 4. Tier 2: Gradient Correctness Testing\n   379→\n   380→**Goal:** To prove that the automatic differentiation capabilities are mathematically correct.\n   381→\n   382→### 4.1 Gradient Checks (`tests/test_gradients.py`)\n   383→\n   384→*   **Target:** All parameters intended for refinement.\n   385→*   **Methodology:** We will use PyTorch's built-in numerical gradient checker, `torch.autograd.gradcheck`. For each parameter, a test will be created that:\n   386→    1.  Sets up a minimal, fast-to-run simulation scenario.\n   387→    2.  Defines a function that takes the parameter tensor as input and returns a scalar loss.\n   388→    3.  Calls `gradcheck` on this function and its input.\n   389→*   **Requirement:** The following parameters (at a minimum) must pass `gradcheck`:\n   390→    *   **Crystal:** `cell_a`, `cell_gamma`, `misset_rot_x`\n   391→    *   **Detector:** `distance_mm`, `Fbeam_mm`\n   392→    *   **Beam:** `lambda_A`\n   393→    *   **Model:** `mosaic_spread_rad`, `fluence`\n   394→\n   395→### 4.2 Multi-Tier Gradient Testing\n   396→\n   397→**Comprehensive gradient testing requires multiple levels of verification:**\n   398→\n   399→#### 4.2.1 Unit-Level Gradient Tests\n   400→- **Target:** Individual components like `get_rotated_real_vectors`\n   401→- **Purpose:** Verify gradients flow correctly through isolated functions\n   402→- **Example:**\n   403→  ```python\n   404→  def test_rotation_gradients():\n   405→      phi_start = torch.tensor(10.0, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float64)\n   406→      config = CrystalConfig(phi_start_deg=phi_start)\n   407→      rotated_vectors = crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors(config)\n   408→      assert rotated_vectors[0].requires_grad\n   409→      assert torch.autograd.gradcheck(lambda x: crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors(\n   410→          CrystalConfig(phi_start_deg=x))[0].sum(), phi_start)\n   411→  ```\n   412→\n   413→#### 4.2.2 Integration-Level Gradient Tests\n   414→- **Target:** End-to-end `Simulator.run()` method\n   415→- **Purpose:** Verify gradients flow through complete simulation chain\n   416→- **Critical:** All configuration parameters must be tensors to preserve gradient flow\n   417→\n   418→#### 4.2.3 Gradient Stability Tests\n   419→- **Target:** Parameter ranges and edge cases\n   420→- **Purpose:** Verify gradients remain stable across realistic parameter variations\n   421→- **Example:**\n   422→  ```python\n   423→  def test_gradient_stability():\n   424→      for phi_val in [0.0, 45.0, 90.0, 180.0]:\n   425→          phi_start = torch.tensor(phi_val, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float64)\n   426→          config = CrystalConfig(phi_start_deg=phi_start)\n   427→          result = simulator.run_with_config(config)\n   428→          assert result.requires_grad\n   429→  ```\n   430→\n   431→#### 4.2.4 Gradient Flow Debugging\n   432→- **Purpose:** Systematic approach to diagnose gradient breaks\n   433→- **Methodology:**\n   434→  1. **Isolation:** Create minimal test case with `requires_grad=True`\n   435→  2. **Tracing:** Check `requires_grad` at each computation step\n   436→  3. **Break Point Identification:** Find where gradients are lost\n   437→  4. **Common Causes:**\n   438→     - `.item()` calls on differentiable tensors (detaches from computation graph)\n   439→     - `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints (known PyTorch limitation)\n   440→     - Manual tensor overwriting instead of functional computation\n   441→     - Using `.detach()` or `.numpy()` on tensors that need gradients\n   442→\n   443→## 5. Tier 3: Scientific Validation Testing\n   444→\n   445→**Goal:** To validate the model against objective physical principles, independent of the original C code.\n   446→\n   447→### 5.1 First Principles Tests (`tests/test_validation.py`)\n   448→\n   449→*   **Target:** The fundamental geometry and physics of the simulation.\n   450→*   **Methodology:**\n   451→    *   **`test_bragg_spot_position`:**\n   452→        1.  Configure a simple case: cubic cell, beam along Z, detector on XY plane, no rotations.\n   453→        2.  Analytically calculate the exact (x,y) position of a low-index reflection (e.g., (1,0,0)) using the Bragg equation and simple trigonometry.\n   454→        3.  Run the simulation.\n   455→        4.  Find the coordinates of the brightest pixel in the output image using `torch.argmax`.\n   456→        5.  Assert that the simulated spot position is within one pixel of the analytically calculated position.\n   457→    *   **`test_polarization_limits`:**\n   458→        1.  Configure a reflection to be at exactly 90 degrees 2-theta.\n   459→        2.  Run the simulation with polarization set to horizontal. Assert the spot intensity is near maximum.\n   460→        3.  Run again with polarization set to vertical. Assert the spot intensity is near zero.\n   461→\n   462→## 6. Tooling & Benchmark Hygiene\n   463→\n   464→- **Directory layout:** Place benchmarks, profilers, and ad-hoc tooling under `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py`). Do not add standalone executables to the repo root.\n   465→- **Environment parity:** All tooling must honour the same environment contract as the tests (`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, `NB_C_BIN` precedence, editable install). Scripts SHOULD exit with a non-zero status if prerequisites are missing.\n   466→- **Plan integration:** When a benchmark exposes a regression, log the command, metrics, and artifact path under `docs/fix_plan.md` › `## Suite Failures` or the relevant tracking section.\n   467→- **Generalisation:** These expectations apply to any PyTorch project you touch—structure tooling predictably, rely on documented env vars, and keep benchmark commands discoverable through project docs.\n   468→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"272e64f0-9538-41da-90c4-5bdd661bb0df","uuid":"549dffae-17c8-4498-8677-ae13c1b5b6b4"}

This document will save you 4-8 hours by identifying common issues:\n    91→    - Unit system confusion (Detector uses meters internally, not Angstroms)\n    92→    - MOSFLM convention axis swap and +0.5 pixel offset\n    93→    - Undocumented CUSTOM convention switching\n    94→    - Known C code logging bugs\n    95→    - **Failure to read this checklist will result in DAYS of unnecessary debugging!**\n    96→\n    97→0.  **Configuration Parity is Mandatory:** Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult the [C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md). This document is the single source of truth for all parameter mappings and implicit C-code conventions. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:\n    98→    - Implicit pivot mode logic (e.g., `-twotheta` implies SAMPLE pivot)\n    99→    - Convention-dependent beam center calculations (MOSFLM adds 0.5 pixel adjustment)\n   100→    - Rotation axis defaults (MOSFLM uses Y-axis, XDS uses X-axis for twotheta)\n   101→    - Unit conversions (mm→m, degrees→radians)\n   102→\n   103→0.  **Instrumentation / Tracing Discipline:** Never re-derive physics or duplicate algorithms in trace/debug code. Instrumentation must reuse the production helpers or cached intermediates so traces reflect the exact values the main path computed (see [Architecture Hub](./docs/architecture/README.md#⚠️-trace-instrumentation-rule)). Parallel \"trace-only\" implementations inevitably drift and make parity debugging unreliable.\n   104→\n   105→1.  **Units (canonical in spec/arch):** Use the conversions and detector hybrid exception exactly as defined in `specs/spec-a.md` (Units & Geometry) and summarized in `arch.md` and `docs/architecture/detector.md`.\n   106→\n   107→2.  **Crystallographic Convention (by design):** Compute h,k,l via real‑space dot (see `specs/spec-a.md` Physics for the authoritative statement).\n   108→\n   109→3.  **Differentiability:** Follow `arch.md` Differentiability Guidelines (no `.item()` on grad tensors, avoid `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints, derive via functions/properties) and require `torch.autograd.gradcheck` for parameters.\n   110→\n   111→4.  **Coordinate System & Image Orientation:** This project uses a `(slow, fast)` pixel indexing convention, consistent with `matplotlib.imshow(origin='lower')` and `fabio`.\n   112→    -   **Action:** Ensure all `torch.meshgrid` calls use `indexing=\"ij\"` to produce `(slow, fast)` grids.\n   113→    -   **Verification:** When comparing to external images (like the Golden Suite), always confirm the axis orientation. A 90-degree rotation in the diff image is a classic sign of an axis swap.\n   114→\n   115→5.  **Parallel Trace Debugging is Mandatory:** All debugging of physics discrepancies **MUST** begin with a parallel trace comparison.\n   116→    -   **Action:** Generate a step-by-step log from the instrumented C code and an identical log from the PyTorch script (`scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`). Compare these two files to find the first line where they numerically diverge. **Before comparing, consult the component contract in `docs/architecture/` to verify the expected units of all variables in the trace log.**\n   117→    -   **Reference:** See `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` for the strategy and `docs/debugging/debugging.md` for the detailed workflow.\n   118→    -   **Key Scripts:** The primary script for end-to-end validation is `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py`. It uses helper modules `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` to execute the C code and `scripts/smv_parser.py` to read the output images. For single-pixel, step-by-step debugging, use `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n   119→\n   120→6.  **PyTorch Environment Variable:** All PyTorch code execution **MUST** set the environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to prevent MKL library conflicts.\n   121→    -   **Action:** Either set `os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'TRUE'` in Python before importing torch, or prefix command-line calls with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.\n   122→    -   **Reason:** Prevents \"Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libiomp5.dylib already initialized\" crashes when multiple libraries (PyTorch, NumPy) load MKL runtime.\n   123→    -   **Verification:** All Python scripts and tests that import torch must include this environment variable setting.\n   124→\n   125→7.  **Differentiable Programming Principles:** All PyTorch code **MUST** maintain computational graph connectivity for gradient flow.\n   126→    -   **Action:** Avoid functions that explicitly detach tensors from the computation graph within a differentiable code path.\n   127→    -   **Forbidden:** Using `.item()`, `.numpy()`, or `.detach()` on a tensor that requires a gradient, as this will sever the gradient path.\n   128→    -   **Correct:** Pass tensors directly through the computation pipeline. Use Python-level control flow (like `isinstance`) to handle different input types gracefully, but ensure the core operations are performed on tensors.\n   129→    -   **Known Limitation:** Be aware that some PyTorch functions, like `torch.linspace`, do not propagate gradients to their `start` and `end` arguments. In such cases, a manual, differentiable implementation using basic tensor operations (e.g., `torch.arange`) is required.\n   130→    -   **Verification:** All differentiable parameters must have passing `torch.autograd.gradcheck` tests.\n   131→\n   132→8.  **Preserve C-Code References Until Feature-Complete:** C-code quotes in docstrings serve as a roadmap for unimplemented features. They **MUST NOT** be removed until the corresponding feature is fully implemented, tested, and validated.\n   133→    -   **Action:** When implementing a feature described by a C-code quote, leave the quote in place. Once the feature is complete and all its tests (including integration and gradient tests) are passing, the quote may be updated or removed if it no longer adds value beyond the implemented code.\n   134→    -   **Example:** A docstring for an unimplemented function should retain its C-code reference. A docstring for a partially implemented function (e.g., `phi` rotation is done but `misset` is not) should retain the C-code reference for the unimplemented part, clearly marked as \"Future Work\".\n   135→    -   **Verification:** Before removing any C-code reference, confirm that the functionality it describes is covered by a passing test in the test suite.\n   136→\n   137→9.  **Never Use `.item()` on Differentiable Tensors:** The `.item()` method **MUST NOT** be used on any tensor that needs to remain differentiable.\n   138→    -   **Action:** Pass tensors directly to configuration objects and functions instead of extracting scalar values.\n   139→    -   **Forbidden:** `config = Config(param=tensor.item())` - This permanently severs the computation graph.\n   140→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=tensor)` - Preserves gradient flow.\n   141→    -   **Verification:** Any use of `.item()` must be followed by verification that the tensor is not needed for gradient computation.\n   142→\n   143→9.  **Avoid `torch.linspace` for Gradient-Critical Code:** `torch.linspace` does not preserve gradients from tensor endpoints.\n   144→    -   **Action:** Use manual tensor arithmetic for differentiable range generation: `start + step_size * torch.arange(...)`.\n   145→    -   **Forbidden:** `torch.linspace(start_tensor, end_tensor, steps)` where `start_tensor` or `end_tensor` require gradients.\n   146→    -   **Correct:** `start_tensor + (end_tensor - start_tensor) * torch.arange(steps) / (steps - 1)`.\n   147→    -   **Verification:** Check that generated ranges preserve `requires_grad=True` when input tensors require gradients.\n   148→\n   149→10. **Boundary Enforcement for Type Safety:** Use clean architectural boundaries to handle tensor/scalar conversions.\n   150→    -   **Action:** Core methods assume tensor inputs; type conversions happen at call sites.\n   151→    -   **Forbidden:** `isinstance(param, torch.Tensor)` checks inside core computational methods.\n   152→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=torch.tensor(value))` at boundaries, `def core_method(tensor_param)` in implementation.\n   153→    -   **Verification:** Core methods should not contain type checking logic; all parameters should be tensors with consistent device/dtype.\n   154→\n   155→11. **C-Code Reference Template (MANDATORY FOR ALL PORTED FUNCTIONS):**\n   156→    -   **Action:** When implementing ANY function that ports logic from nanoBragg.c, you MUST:\n   157→        1. FIRST create the function stub with the docstring template below\n   158→        2. THEN fill in the C-code reference BEFORE writing any implementation\n   159→        3.

It provides a direct, in-code link between the new implementation and its ground-truth reference, which is essential for debugging and verification. Failure to include this reference is considered an implementation error.\n   181→\n   182→12. **Critical Data Flow Convention: The Misset Rotation Pipeline**\n   183→\n   184→    **This rule is non-negotiable and describes a non-standard data flow that MUST be replicated exactly.** The static misset orientation is integrated into the lattice vector calculation in a specific sequence.\n   185→\n   186→    The correct, end-to-end data flow is:\n   187→    1.  Calculate the **base** real (`a,b,c`) and reciprocal (`a*,b*,c*`) vectors from the six unit cell parameters in a canonical orientation.\n   188→    2.  Apply the static misset rotation matrix to **only the reciprocal vectors** (`a*,b*,c*`).\n   189→    3.  **Crucially, recalculate the real-space vectors (`a,b,c`) from the newly rotated reciprocal vectors** using the standard crystallographic relationship (e.g., `a = (b* x c*) * V`).\n   190→    4.  These recalculated, misset-aware real-space vectors are then passed to the dynamic rotation pipeline (`get_rotated_real_vectors`) and are ultimately used in the simulator's Miller index calculation (`h = S·a`).\n   191→\n   192→    **Rationale:** This specific sequence is how `nanoBragg.c` ensures the static orientation is correctly propagated. Any deviation will cause the simulation to fail validation against the golden test cases.\n   193→\n   194→13. **Reciprocal Vector Recalculation for Self-Consistency**\n   195→\n   196→    **The C-code performs a circular recalculation that MUST be replicated for exact metric duality.** After building initial reciprocal vectors and calculating real vectors from them, the C-code recalculates the reciprocal vectors using the standard formula.\n   197→\n   198→    The complete sequence is:\n   199→    1. Build initial reciprocal vectors using the default orientation convention\n   200→    2. Calculate real vectors from reciprocal: `a = (b* × c*) × V`\n   201→    3. **Recalculate reciprocal vectors from real**: `a* = (b × c) / V_actual`\n   202→    4. **Use actual volume**: `V_actual = a · (b × c)` instead of the formula volume\n   203→\n   204→    **Critical:** The volume from the actual vectors differs slightly (~0.6% for triclinic cells) from the formula volume. Using V_actual ensures perfect metric duality (a·a* = 1 exactly).\n   205→\n   206→    **Verification:** The `test_metric_duality` test must pass with `rtol=1e-12`.\n   207→\n   208→14. **Mandatory Component Contracts:** For any non-trivial component port (e.g., `Detector`, `Crystal`), the first step of the implementation phase **MUST** be to author (or consult, if it exists) a complete technical specification in `docs/architecture/[component_name].md`. This contract is the authoritative source for all conventions, units, and logic flows. Implementation must not begin until this document is complete.\n   209→\n   210→15. **Detector Geometry Conventions:** The Detector component follows specific conventions that **MUST** be preserved:\n   211→    -   **Coordinate System:** Lab frame with beam along +X axis, right-handed system, sample at origin\n   212→    -   **Pixel Indexing:** `(slow, fast)` order using `torch.meshgrid(..., indexing=\"ij\")`\n   213→    -   **Pixel Reference:** Integer indices refer to pixel **leading edge/corner**, not center\n   214→    -   **Rotation Order:** detector_rotx → detector_roty → detector_rotz → detector_twotheta\n   215→    -   **Convention Dependency:** MOSFLM vs XDS affects initial basis vectors and twotheta axis\n   216→    -   **Unit Handling:** User config in mm/degrees, internal calculations in Angstroms/radians\n   217→    -   **Pivot Modes:** BEAM pivot (around beam spot) vs SAMPLE pivot (around sample position)\n   218→    -   **Verification:** All detector tests must pass, including basis vector orthonormality and gradient flow\n   219→\n   220→16. **PyTorch Device & Dtype Neutrality:** Implementation MUST work for CPU and GPU tensors and for all supported dtypes without silent device transfers.\n   221→    -   **Action:** Accept tensors on whatever device/dtype the caller provides; use helper utilities (`to()`/`type_as()`) to coerce internal temporaries to the dominant device/dtype instead of hard-coding `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` or allocating new CPU tensors mid-pipeline.\n   222→    -   **Verification:** Add (or update) smoke tests that exercise both CPU and CUDA execution whenever a code path touches tensor math; at minimum, run the authoritative command once with `device=cpu` and once with `device=cuda` (when available) before marking work complete. Treat any Dynamo/compile warnings about mixed devices as failures to resolve immediately.\n   223→    -   **Forbidden:** Leaving datasets, constants, or configuration tensors on default CPU while multiplying by GPU intermediates; relying on implicit device promotion; assuming float64/CPU execution in production paths.\n   224→    -   **Scope:** This applies across the project and to any future PyTorch work you undertake—make code device/dtype agnostic by default.\n   225→\n   226→17. **Tooling & Benchmark Placement:** Benchmark, profiling, and diagnostic scripts SHALL live under structured tooling directories (`scripts/benchmarks/`, `scripts/profiling/`, etc.) and follow the repo’s CLI/env conventions.\n   227→    -   **Action:** When creating or modifying benchmarking utilities, place them under `scripts/…`, require `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, resolve binaries via the documented precedence, and record authoritative commands in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or the relevant tooling index).\n   228→    -   **Forbidden:** Dropping standalone benchmarking files in the repo root or bypassing the editable-install expectation with ad-hoc `sys.path` tweaks.\n   229→    -   **Verification:** Update `docs/fix_plan.md` (Suite/Tooling section) with reproduction commands and results every time a benchmark uncovers an issue; ensure CI/docs reference the canonical script location.\n   230→\n   231→## Crystallographic Conventions\n   232→\n   233→This project adheres to the `|G| = 1/d` convention, where `G = h*a* + k*b* + l*c*`. This is equivalent to the `|Q| = 2π/d` convention where `Q = 2πG`. All tests and calculations must be consistent with this standard.\n   234→\n   235→**Default Orientation Matrix**: The project uses the nanoBragg.c convention for constructing the default orientation of reciprocal lattice vectors from cell parameters:\n   236→- a* is placed purely along the x-axis\n   237→- b* is placed in the x-y plane  \n   238→- c* fills out 3D space\n   239→\n   240→This specific orientation must be maintained for consistency with the C-code implementation.\n   241→\n   242→## Golden Test Case Specification (`simple_cubic`)\n   243→\n   244→**The exact `nanoBragg.c` commands used to generate all golden reference data are centrally documented in `tests/golden_data/README.md`. That file is the single source of truth for reproducing the test suite.**\n   245→\n   246→The following parameters for the `simple_cubic` case are provided for quick reference and context. These are the ground truth for the baseline validation milestone.\n   247→\n   248→* **Detector Size:** `1024 x 1024` pixels\n   249→* **Pixel Size:** `0.1` mm\n   250→* **Detector Distance:** `100` mm\n   251→* **Beam Center:** `(512.5, 512.5)` pixels (derived from detector size and beam position)\n   252→* **Wavelength (`lambda`):** `6.2` Å\n   253→* **Crystal Cell:** `100 x 100 x 100` Å, `90, 90, 90` degrees\n   254→* **Crystal Size (`-N`):** `5 x 5 x 5` cells\n   255→* **Default Structure Factor (`-default_F`):** `100`\n   256→\n   257→## Repository Overview\n   258→\n   259→This repository contains **nanoBragg**, a C-based diffraction simulator for nanocrystals, along with comprehensive documentation for a planned PyTorch port.

handle type conversions at call sites only\n   344→   - **Forbidden:** `isinstance(param, torch.Tensor)` checks inside computational methods\n   345→   - **Correct:** Convert scalars to tensors at API boundaries, maintain tensors throughout core\n   346→   - **Benefit:** Clean architecture while preserving gradient flow\n   347→\n   348→5. **Avoid Gradient-Breaking Operations**\n   349→   - **Forbidden in gradient paths:**\n   350→     - `.detach()` — explicitly breaks gradient connection\n   351→     - `.numpy()` — converts to NumPy array, losing autograd\n   352→     - `.cpu()` without maintaining graph — can break device consistency\n   353→   - **Allowed:** These operations are safe in non-differentiable contexts (logging, visualization)\n   354→\n   355→### Testing Requirements\n   356→\n   357→**Every differentiable parameter MUST have:**\n   358→1. **Unit-level gradient test:** Verify gradients flow through isolated functions\n   359→2. **Integration gradient test:** Verify end-to-end gradient flow through complete simulation\n   360→3. **Stability test:** Verify gradients remain stable across parameter variations\n   361→4. **Use `torch.autograd.gradcheck`:** With `dtype=torch.float64` for numerical precision (note: gradient tests explicitly override to float64 for accuracy, even though default dtype is float32)\n   362→\n   363→### Common Pitfalls and Solutions\n   364→\n   365→| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |\n   366→|---------|---------|----------|\n   367→| Using `.item()` in config | Gradients are None | Pass tensors directly |\n   368→| `torch.linspace` with tensor bounds | No gradient on start/end | Manual arithmetic |\n   369→| Overwriting derived attributes | Stale gradients | Use @property methods |\n   370→| Type checks in core methods | Complex branching | Boundary enforcement |\n   371→| In-place operations | Runtime errors | Use out-of-place ops |\n   372→\n   373→### Architecture Implications\n   374→\n   375→- **Config objects:** Must accept both scalars and tensors, preserving tensor types\n   376→- **Model classes:** Use @property for all derived geometric/crystallographic quantities\n   377→- **Simulator:** Maintain tensor operations throughout;

(2) Multi-source polarization continues to reuse only the first source direction, leaving secondary sources unpolarized and violating AT-SRC-001 (`simulator.py:775-822` and `simulator.py:894-950`). (3) The `steps` normalization still divides by `source_weights.sum()` so intensities average instead of summing (`simulator.py:687-695`). (4) ROI masks and external masks are rebuilt from scratch on every run, causing allocator churn and keeping CPU benchmarks slower than C even after warm caches (`simulator.py:611-629`).\n   164→    Next Actions: Re-open plan tasks P3.0/P3.0b/P3.0c/P3.4 in code, implement guarded seeding + per-source polarization + post-sum weighting before normalization, then hoist ROI/misset tensors ahead of re-running benchmarks.

(2) `roi_mask = torch.ones(...)` (`simulator.py:618-635`) and `detector.get_pixel_coords().to(...)` rebuild large tensors per call, blocking P3.4’s allocator goals. (3) The revised `source_norm = n_sources` path needs validation with a weighted multi-source test to ensure it matches C output. \n   179→    Next Actions: Ralph to execute plan tasks P3.0b (per-source polarization) and P3.0c (normalization validation with weighted sources) with new trace/benchmark artifacts, then deliver P3.4 ROI/misset caching before re-running P3.2/P3.3 benchmarks.\n   180→  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #16 — Result: supervisor audit (galph loop AZ). Reviewed `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2604-3278` and confirmed the C implementation ignores `source_I` during the accumulation loop (it only seeds `I` before `I = I_bg`).

Re-executed CPU benchmarks after P3.0/P3.0b/P3.4 landed; archived summary under `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/cpu/`. Warm runs now show 256² 4.07× faster than C and 512² within tolerance (0.82× slower), but 1024² remains 2.43× slower (0.41× speedup). Cache setup stayed <50 ms (4376–6428× faster). Correlations ≥0.9999999999366 throughout.\n   191→    Metrics: CPU warm timings — 256²: 0.003 s vs C 0.012 s; 512²: 0.025 s vs C 0.020 s; 1024²: 0.099 s vs C 0.041 s. Tests: 43 passed, 1 skipped.\n   192→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/cpu/P3.2_summary.md`; `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/cpu/benchmark_results.json`; log referenced in summary (`/tmp/cpu_benchmark_20250930-213314.log`).\n   193→    Observations/Hypotheses: Small/medium grids improved, but large CPU detector still violates ≤1.5× goal. Need CUDA results plus weighted-source parity before Phase 3 closure. P3.0c remains the gating prerequisite for final benchmarking memo.\n   194→    Next Actions: Run P3.3 CUDA benchmarks once cudagraph blocker is cleared; finish P3.0c weighted-source validation before issuing the Phase 3 decision (P3.5).\n   195→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #19 — Result: partial (P3.3 CUDA benchmarks captured; weighting unresolved). Added `torch.compiler.cudagraph_mark_step_begin()` in `_compute_physics_for_position` wrapper to fix CUDA graphs aliasing, then collected CUDA benchmarks (`reports/benchmarks/20250930-220739/`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220755/`). Warm GPU runs now beat C (256² 1.55×, 512² 1.69×, 1024² 3.33× faster) with cache setup ≤18 ms and correlation ≥0.999999999912. CPU 1024² deficit from Attempt #18 persists.\n   196→    Metrics: CUDA warm timings — 256²: 0.00683 s vs C 0.01061 s (1.55×); 512²: 0.00769 s vs C 0.01298 s (1.69×); 1024²: 0.01211 s vs C 0.04031 s (3.33×). CUDA grad smoke: `distance_mm.grad = -70.37`. Tests: 43 passed, 1 skipped.\n   197→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220739/benchmark_results.json`; `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220755/benchmark_results.json`; fix in `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (commit e617ccb).\n   198→    Next Actions: Execute P3.0c weighted-source parity checklist (two-source unequal weights) and capture regression evidence before rerunning P3.2/P3.3 benchmarks; investigate 1024² CPU hotspot once parity decision recorded.\n   199→  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #20 — Result: supervisor audit (no code change). Verified multi-source vectorization now applies Kahn factors per source, but normalization still divides by `n_sources` after applying optional weights. C ignores input weights entirely, so PyTorch currently undercounts unequal-weight cases (average of weights instead of sum). ROI/pixel coordinate caching (`Simulator.__init__`:534-564) confirmed effective; allocator churn persists primarily from per-run ROI `.to()` copies. CPU benchmarks remain >2× slower at 1024² despite cache fixes.\n   200→    Metrics: Analysis only.\n   201→    Artifacts: n/a (findings documented in plan + galph_memory).\n   202→    Observations/Hypotheses: Need concrete reproduction showing the mismatch before altering normalization semantics; benchmarking without parity evidence risks drawing false conclusions.\n   203→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #21 — Result: success (Phase B complete). Executed remaining Phase B tasks: marked B3 skipped (would require gprof recompilation; deemed optional), completed B5 eager-mode profiling at 1024². Results: PyTorch eager warm 0.082s vs C 0.052s (1.64× slower), profiler trace captured.\n   204→    Metrics: 1024² eager mode 1.64× slower than C; significantly slower than compiled mode (0.082s vs ~0.565s at 4096² from B4).\n   205→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-025010/` with Chrome trace in profile_1024x1024/trace.json; plan updated with B3/B5 completion in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md`.\n   206→    Observations/Hypotheses: Eager mode profiling confirms torch.compile provides substantial performance benefit. Structure-factor advanced indexing cost visible in trace. Phase B diagnostics now complete; all profiling evidence collected for Phase C decision.\n   207→    Next Actions: Review Phase B findings (B4 shows 1.11-1.15× performance, within 10% of ≤1.2× target). Decide whether to proceed to Phase C diagnostics or close plan as target nearly achieved.\n   208→    Observations/Hypotheses: Without parity evidence, the plan closure claim in commit e8742d7 is unsupported; Phase 3 cannot end until unequal-weight cases either match C or a deliberate contract change is documented. CPU 1024² still 2.43× slower, so we lack data to justify deferring Phase 4.\n   209→    Next Actions: Deliver P3.0c artifacts (two-source unequal weights) per plan guidance, fix normalization semantics, then rerun CPU/CUDA benchmarks (P3.2/P3.3) before issuing the Phase 3 memo (P3.5).\n   210→    Observations/Hypotheses: PERF-PYTORCH-005 cudagraph guard clears blocker, but Phase 3 exit still gated by P3.0c weighted-source parity and CPU 1024² slowdown. `BeamConfig.source_weights` docstring still claims weights are ignored—update documentation once parity decision lands. Need nb-compare + pytest artifacts for unequal weights before considering P3.0c closed.\n   211→    Next Actions: Execute P3.0c weighted-source validation (two-source unequal weights, CPU+CUDA, nb-compare + pytest), then revisit CPU 1024² deficit in the Phase 3 memo (P3.5). Update plan table to link new CUDA artifacts once parity evidence is captured.\n   212→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #21 — Result: P3.0c COMPLETE. Validated weighted multi-source normalization on CPU and CUDA with 2 sources (weights 2.0 & 3.0, λ 6.2Å & 8.0Å). PyTorch correctly implements `steps / n_sources` normalization per AT-SRC-001. Discovered C code ignores `source_I` weights during accumulation (line 2616 overwrites weight with `I_bg`), making C↔Py weighted parity impossible. CPU/CUDA self-consistency verified (rel diff <2e-6).\n   213→    Metrics: CPU total=8.914711e-05, CUDA total=8.914727e-05, rel_diff=1.80e-06 (<0.01%).\n   214→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/{P3.0c_summary.md, validation_results.json, weighted_sources.txt, validate_weighted_source_normalization.py}`.\n   215→    Observations/Hypotheses: PyTorch applies weights as multiplicative factors per-source before averaging; C ignores them entirely. PyTorch behavior is spec-compliant and more flexible. Semantic difference documented but not a bug. P3.0c blocker cleared; CPU/CUDA benchmarks (P3.2/P3.3) can proceed; Phase 3 decision (P3.5) unblocked.\n   216→    Next Actions: Mark P3.0c as `[X]` in plan; proceed with Phase 3 memo (P3.5) incorporating existing CPU/CUDA benchmark data and the 1024² CPU deficit analysis.\n   217→  * [2025-10-10] Attempt #22 (supervisor loop BD) — Result: invalidates Attempt #21. `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` mutates `simulator.source_directions/weights/wavelengths`, but the simulator only uses `_source_*` tensors populated from `BeamConfig` during `__init__`. The run therefore fell back to the single-source branch, so the recorded CPU/CUDA totals do not exercise unequal weights. Weighted-source parity evidence remains outstanding.\n   218→    Metrics: Analysis only (confirmed `_source_directions is None` after running the script).\n   219→    Artifacts: n/a — findings logged here and in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (P3.0c row).\n   220→    Observations/Hypotheses: Need a harness that feeds multi-source tensors through `BeamConfig` (or directly updates `_source_*` caches) before instantiating `Simulator`. Until that exists, P3.0c cannot close nor can Phase 3 be declared complete.\n   221→    Next Actions: Repair the validation script, regenerate CPU/CUDA results with unequal weights, archive outputs under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-multi-source-normalization/`, then resume P3.2/P3.3 and P3.5.\n   222→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #26 (ralph loop) — Result: P3.0c COMPLETE (validated). Fixed validation script to use repo-relative path (line 168-174), resolved FileNotFoundError. Re-ran validation successfully with weighted sources (2.0 & 3.0 weights, λ 6.2Å & 8.0Å) plumbed through BeamConfig constructor.\n   223→    Metrics: CPU total=5.750597e-05, CUDA total=5.750608e-05, rel_diff=1.771353e-06 (<0.0002% vs threshold 0.01%). Multi-source caching verified: directions shape torch.Size([2,3]), wavelengths [6.2Å, 8.0Å], weights [2.0, 3.0].\n   224→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/validation_results.json`; corrected `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` (Path-based output).\n   225→    Observations/Hypotheses: Validation now exercises BeamConfig-based source injection, confirming _source_* tensors are properly cached during Simulator.__init__. CPU/CUDA self-consistency proven with unequal weights. Phase 3 decision memo can proceed using existing P3.2/P3.3 benchmark data.\n   226→    Next Actions: Mark P3.0c as complete in plan.md; Phase 3 complete—all tasks delivered with valid parity evidence.\n   227→  * [2025-10-11] Attempt #27 (supervisor loop BH) — Result: follow-up required. Commit 0a78312 removed the absolute output path but still hard-codes the directory name (`reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/`), so repeated runs overwrite evidence and Phase A0 remains only partially satisfied. Plan updated to `[P]` with guidance to parameterise the stamp/CLI override before closing the task.\n   228→    Metrics: n/a (analysis only).\n   229→    Artifacts: plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md (A0 row updated).\n   230→    Observations/Hypotheses: Need dynamic stamping (e.g., timestamped directory or CLI argument) so future reruns land under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-.../` per plan expectations. Until then Phase A baseline capture remains blocked.\n   231→    Next Actions: Ralph to extend the script with an `--out` flag or timestamped default, rerun validation, and update plan/fix-plan entries with new artifact paths.\n   232→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #28 (ralph loop BJ) — Result: success. Added timestamped default directory and `--outdir` CLI flag to `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py`.\n   233→    Metrics: Validation run successful (CPU total=5.750597e-05, CUDA total=5.750608e-05, rel_diff=1.771353e-06). Core geometry tests 31/31 passed in 5.26s.\n   234→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-004135-multi-source-normalization/validation_results.json` (timestamped), `reports/benchmarks/custom-test/validation_results.json` (CLI override test).\n   235→    Observations/Hypotheses: Script now defaults to `reports/benchmarks/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-multi-source-normalization/` pattern, ensuring successive runs produce unique directories. CLI flag `--outdir` allows explicit override (relative or absolute paths). Fix unblocks Phase A baseline capture.\n   236→    Next Actions: Mark plan.md task A0 as `[X]` complete. Proceed with A1-A4 baseline benchmarks.\n   237→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #23 (ralph loop BC) — Result: Phase 3 decision memo written BEFORE Attempt #22 invalidation. Wrote comprehensive memo integrating P3.0–P3.4 deliverables and CPU/CUDA benchmarks assuming P3.0c was valid. Recommendation: DEFER Phase 4 (graph optimization) given CUDA meets all targets (1.55–3.33× faster than C across 256²–1024²) and only large CPU detectors (1024²) show deficit (2.4× slower).\n   238→    Metrics: CPU — 256²: 4.07× faster, 512²: 1.23× slower (within tolerance), 1024²: 2.43× slower. CUDA — 256²: 1.55× faster, 512²: 1.69× faster, 1024²: 3.33× faster. Cache: 37–6428× setup speedup. Correlations ≈1.0 throughout.\n   239→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/PHASE_3_DECISION.md` (decision memo - **PROVISIONAL pending P3.0c correction**), `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/cpu/P3.2_summary.md` (CPU), `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220739/benchmark_results.json` (CUDA).\n   240→    Observations/Hypotheses: CUDA performance validates torch.compile effectiveness. 1024² CPU deficit likely stems from memory bandwidth (L3 cache pressure) and C compiler advantage for sequential loops. Production users prioritize GPU for large detectors. Phase 4 graph work has uncertain ROI given CUDA already exceeds targets. **NOTE:** Phase 3 decision memo is PROVISIONAL because Attempt #22 invalidated P3.0c weighted-source validation.\n   241→    Next Actions: Re-execute Attempt #22 corrective actions (fix validation script with BeamConfig-based weights), regenerate P3.0c artifacts, then update Phase 3 decision memo if weighted-source semantics change. Keep memo marked PROVISIONAL until P3.0c re-validated.\n   242→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #24 (ralph loop BD) — Result: P3.0c COMPLETE (corrected). Fixed `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` to properly route weighted sources through `BeamConfig` constructor before instantiating `Simulator`. Script now converts wavelengths from Angstroms to meters, passes all source parameters via `BeamConfig`, and verifies multi-source caching with assertions. Re-ran validation successfully.\n   243→    Metrics: CPU total=5.750597e-05, CUDA total=5.750608e-05, rel_diff=1.771353e-06 (<0.0002% vs threshold 0.01%). Multi-source caching verified: directions shape torch.Size([2,3]), wavelengths [6.2Å, 8.0Å], weights [2.0, 3.0].\n   244→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/P3.0c_summary_corrected.md`, updated `validation_results.json`, corrected `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py`.\n   245→    Observations/Hypotheses: The old Attempt #21 validation was invalid because it set `simulator.source_*` attributes post-construction; these are never read—only `_source_*` caches populated from `BeamConfig` during `__init__` are used. Corrected approach passes sources through BeamConfig before construction, ensuring `_source_directions/_source_wavelengths/_source_weights` are properly cached. CPU/CUDA self-consistency now proven with unequal weights exercised. Phase 3 decision memo can be finalized.\n   246→    Next Actions: Mark P3.0c as `[X]` in plan.md; finalize Phase 3 decision memo (P3.5) removing PROVISIONAL status. Phase 3 complete—all tasks delivered with valid parity evidence.\n   247→  * [2025-10-11] Attempt #25 — Result: diagnostic blockers surfaced. Re-running `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` on macOS fails with `FileNotFoundError` because the script still writes to `/home/ollie/.../validation_results.json`. P3.0c evidence cannot be regenerated until the path is made repo-relative. Warm-run CPU profiling after compile (512² detector, `torch.compile` cached) reports `Torch-Compiled Region` dominating (~3.8 ms) with `aten::mul`/`aten::sum` leading operations. Need eager-mode traces to quantify `Crystal._nearest_neighbor_lookup` advanced indexing cost and to measure the ~200 MB `_cached_pixel_coords_meters` tensor that likely drives the 4096² slowdown. Updated plan Phase A with task A0 (fix script path) and added Phase B task B5 plus Phase C tasks C6/C7 to capture these diagnostics before attempting new optimizations.\n   248→    Metrics: Profiling (512² warm) shows compiled region ≈66 % of CPU time; validation script stack trace terminates at `/home/ollie/.../validation_results.json`.\n   249→    Artifacts: Inline profiling output (no trace saved yet); updated plan `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md`.\n   250→    Observations/Hypotheses: Multi-source tooling must be path-agnostic; structure-factor gather and pixel-coordinate cache size remain top suspects for the 3.4× warm gap.\n   251→    Next Actions: Repair validation script output path (plan task A0), record eager-mode trace per B5, then execute C6/C7 experiments prior to any performance code changes.\n   252→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #29 (loop BK) — Result: Phase A COMPLETE. Executed baseline benchmarks (sizes 512–4096, float32, 5 iterations) capturing C and PyTorch timings simultaneously.\n   253→    Metrics: 4096² warm 1.783s (Py) vs 0.502s (C) → speedup 0.28 (Py 3.55× slower). 2048² warm 0.428s vs 0.136s → speedup 0.32 (Py 3.15× slower). 1024² warm 0.093s vs 0.044s → speedup 0.47 (Py 2.11× slower). 512² warm 0.006s vs 0.014s → speedup 2.22 (Py faster). All correlations = 1.000000. Cache setup speedup 6k–114k×.\n   254→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-005052-cpu-baseline/{benchmark_output.log, results/benchmark_results.json, phase_a_summary.md}`.\n   255→    Observations/Hypotheses: Performance gap at 4096² unchanged from prior benchmarks (was 3.4×, now 3.55×). Small sizes show PyTorch wins; large sizes confirm critical deficit. Cache system highly effective (warm setup <1ms). Deterioration pattern suggests memory bandwidth or allocator churn at scale. Ready for Phase B profiling.\n   256→    Next Actions: Proceed to plan Phase B tasks B1–B5 (capture torch profiler traces for 4096² warm run, eager-mode SF lookup profile, hotspot summary with % CPU time per op).\n   257→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #30 (loop BK) — Result: Phase B tasks B1-B2 COMPLETE. Added profiling instrumentation to `benchmark_detailed.py` and captured 4096² CPU warm trace.\n   258→    Metrics: 4096² warm 0.652s (Py) vs 0.524s (C) → speedup 0.80 (Py **1.25× slower**). Simulation time 0.613s. Cache setup <1ms (109,712× speedup).

Code changes: `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` (added --profile, --keep-artifacts, --disable-compile flags; integrated torch.profiler).\n   260→    Observations/Hypotheses: **CRITICAL FINDING:** Single-iteration profiling run shows PyTorch only 1.25× slower (0.652s vs 0.524s), dramatically better than Phase A baseline (3.55× slower, 1.783s). Possible causes: (1) Measurement variation (5-iteration average vs single run), (2) Improved torch.compile state, (3) Cache/memory layout benefits. **Action required:** Re-run Phase A with `--iterations 1` to validate whether gap is truly ~1.25× (near target) or ~3.5× (needs optimization).\n   261→    Next Actions: (1) Re-run Phase A baseline with single iteration for consistency, (2) Complete Phase B task B4 (extract hotspot % from Chrome trace), (3) Run B5 (eager-mode SF profile at 1024²), (4) Decision point: if validated gap ≤1.2×, skip Phase C/D; if >1.2×, proceed with diagnostic experiments.\n   262→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #31 (loop BL) — Result: Reconciliation study COMPLETE. Resolved 1.25× vs 3.55× measurement discrepancy by executing both 1-iter and 5-iter benchmarks at 4096².\n   263→    Metrics: **Current performance:** 1-iter: Py 0.609s vs C 0.528s (1.15× slower); 5-iter: Py 0.600s vs C 0.538s (1.11× slower). **Phase A baseline (for comparison):** Py 1.783s vs C 0.502s (3.55× slower). **Performance improvement:** 3.1× faster PyTorch (1.743s → 0.565s avg simulation time).\n   264→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-014819-measurement-reconciliation/{reconciliation_summary.md, quick_comparison.md, timeline.md, benchmark_results_1iter.json, benchmark_results_5iter.json}`.\n   265→    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) Iteration count does NOT explain discrepancy—1-iter vs 5-iter differ by only 1.6%. (2) PyTorch improved 3.1× between Phase A (00:50:52) and Phase B (01:01:28), most likely due to warm torch.compile cache state. (3) Current performance 1.11-1.15× slower meets ≤1.2× target (within 10% margin). (4) Phase A baseline appears to be outlier with cold cache state.\n   266→    Next Actions: (1) Mark Phase B task B4 complete with reconciliation summary, (2) Update Phase B decision to reflect **TARGET NEARLY ACHIEVED** status, (3) Consider Phase C/D optional \"polish\" work given proximity to goal.\n   267→  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #32 — Result: supervisor audit (no code change). Detected newly added benchmark set reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/ showing warm speedup_warm=0.299 (PyTorch 1.774s vs C 0.531s) — a return to the original 3.3× slowdown. This contradicts Attempt #31's 1.11× measurements and indicates the improvement is not yet reproducible.\n   268→    Metrics: 4096² warm totals — PyTorch 1.7738s, C 0.5306s.\n   269→    Artifacts: reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/benchmark_results.json; reports/benchmarks/20251001-025010/profile_1024x1024/trace.json (B5 eager profile).\n   270→    Observations/Hypotheses: Warm speedup hinges on cache state; without disciplined B6 reproducibility the plan cannot claim Phase B complete. Need cache-cleared reruns plus analysis contrasting 014819 vs 025148 results.\n   271→    Next Actions: Run B6 with explicit cache clearing notes, capture regression memo comparing both datasets, then update plan tables before entering Phase C.\n   272→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #33 (loop CA) — Result: Phase B task B6 COMPLETE. Reproducibility study confirms stable performance at 1.21× slowdown.\n   273→    Metrics: 10 runs (5-iter averages each): mean speedup 0.8280 ± 0.0326 (PyTorch 1.21× slower), CV=3.9% (high reproducibility), correlation=1.0 (perfect numerical accuracy).\n   274→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-030128-4096-warm-repro/{B6_summary.md, reproducibility_results.json, run1.log...run10.log}`.\n   275→    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) Performance is highly stable (CV<5%) confirming measurements are reliable. (2) Mean slowdown 1.21× exceeds ≤1.2× target by small margin (0.01×). (3) No runs achieved speedup ≥1.0 (range: 0.78–0.88). (4) **Phase B complete—target NOT met, proceed to Phase C diagnostics.** This addresses supervisor's Attempt #32 concern—B6 provides the requested reproducibility data showing stable 1.21× slowdown, not the 3.3× regression detected in 025148. Core geometry tests 31/31 passed.\n   276→    Next Actions: Execute Phase C diagnostic experiments (C1-C7) to identify remaining bottlenecks before considering optimization work in Phase D.\n   277→  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #34 (galph loop CG) — Result: Phase B re-opened. New benchmark log `reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/benchmark_results.json` shows warm speedup≈0.30 (PyTorch 1.7738 s vs C 0.5306 s) even with cache hits, contradicting Attempt #33’s 0.828±0.033 average. Investigation found `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` mutates `NB_DISABLE_COMPILE` when `--disable-compile` is toggled while the simulator actually reads `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`, so the flag is ignored and cached compiled simulators bleed across \"eager\" runs. Because the env var is also unset unconditionally, downstream callers inherit indeterminate compile state and benchmark logs lack mode metadata.\n   278→    Next Actions: (1) Implement Plan task B7 (push/pop `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`, cache keyed by mode, compile-mode metadata).

Traces also show a polarization delta (C Kahn factor ≈0.9126 vs PyTorch 1.0) to revisit after geometry fixes.\n   458→- Next Actions: (1) Execute plan Phase H H2–H4: wire `detector.beam_vector` through `Simulator` to restore incident-beam parity, then diagnose remaining lattice deltas and archive metrics under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/`; (2) After lattice parity improves, rerun Phase F3 parity smoke + update docs/fix_plan Attempts with the narrowed intensity gap; (3) With lattice resolved, proceed to Phase I polarization alignment (tasks I1–I3) and clean up residual artifacts such as `scaled.hkl.1` alongside documentation updates.\n   459→- Attempts History:\n   460→  * [2025-10-05] Phase A Complete — Tasks A1-A3 executed per plan.\n   461→    Metrics: C reference behavior captured for both flags via parallel command execution.\n   462→    Artifacts:\n   463→      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_nonoise.log` - C run WITH -nonoise\n   464→      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/c_with_noise.log` - C run WITHOUT -nonoise\n   465→      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/pix0_trace/trace.log` - pix0 vector analysis\n   466→      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` - Complete Phase A findings\n   467→    Observations/Hypotheses:\n   468→      - `-nonoise` suppresses noise parameters section AND noise image generation (noiseimage.img not written)\n   469→      - Float/int/PGM images still generated when -nonoise is active\n   470→      - C code treats `-pix0_vector` and `-pix0_vector_mm` identically (strstr match, no unit conversion)\n   471→      - **Critical finding:** C code does NOT divide by 1000 for `_mm` suffix; caller must provide pre-scaled values\n   472→      - Both pix0 flags trigger `beam_convention = CUSTOM` side effect\n   473→      - Output pix0_vector: -0.216475836 0.216343050 -0.230192414 (meters)\n   474→  * [2025-10-05] Phase C1 Complete — Task C1 executed (CLI regression tests).\n   475→    Metrics: 18 test cases, 18 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (CPU); 17 passed, 1 skipped (CUDA unavailable in environment).\n   476→    Runtime: 3.34s\n   477→    Artifacts:\n   478→      - `tests/test_cli_flags.py` - 293 lines, 18 comprehensive test cases\n   479→      - `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_c/pytest/test_cli_flags.log` - pytest output log\n   480→    Test Coverage:\n   481→      - ✅ pix0_vector meters alias parsing and config storage\n   482→      - ✅ pix0_vector_mm millimeters alias parsing with conversion to meters (mm * 0.001)\n   483→      - ✅ Equivalence of meters and millimeters aliases (tolerance: 1e-12)\n   484→      - ✅ Mutual exclusivity enforcement (ValueError on dual-flag usage)\n   485→      - ✅ Signed combination parametrization (3 scenarios including negatives, zero, small values)\n   486→      - ✅ Detector override persistence through cache invalidation (CPU)\n   487→      - ✅ Detector override persistence through cache invalidation (CUDA, device check)\n   488→      - ✅ Detector override dtype preservation (float32, float64)\n   489→      - ✅ r_factor=1.0 and close_distance consistency when override provided\n   490→      - ✅ -nonoise suppresses noisefile generation (suppress_noise=True)\n   491→      - ✅ -nonoise doesn't mutate adc default (40.0) or seed handling\n   492→      - ✅ -noisefile without -nonoise enables noise generation (suppress_noise=False)\n   493→      - ✅ -nonoise valid without -noisefile (no-op but accepted)\n   494→      - ✅ pix0 override doesn't mutate custom_beam_vector\n   495→      - ✅ pix0 override triggers CUSTOM convention\n   496→      - ✅ ROI remains unaffected by new flags\n   497→      - ✅ MOSFLM convention preserved when pix0 not specified\n   498→    Observations/Hypotheses:\n   499→      - Parser correctly normalizes both aliases to meter-space tensors in config['pix0_override_m']\n   500→      - DetectorConfig and Detector honor pix0_override_m across device/dtype variations\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.
