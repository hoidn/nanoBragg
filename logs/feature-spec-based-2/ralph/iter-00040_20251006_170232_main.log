Execute the Do Now trace harness; tee stdout to trace_py.stdout for later diffing.\n    17→05. Immediately copy `trace_py.log` to a scratch diff view against the 2025-10-22 baseline to spot unit-fix deltas.\n    18→06. Compute Δpix0, ΔFbeam, ΔSbeam manually (spreadsheet or python) and jot them into attempt log.\n    19→07. Verify the trace still reports the corrected `incident_vec` and rotated reciprocal vectors; flag any regressions.\n    20→08. Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` with the new numeric deltas and tolerance checks.\n    21→09.

Double-check no new binary files (e.g., .npy) were produced—cleanup immediately if so.\n    27→15. Signal completion in Attempts History and pause before touching Phase K2 tasks.\n    28→16. Re-run the harness if stdout shows missing TRACE_PY lines; stale caches can drop signals.\n    29→17. Capture a quick checksum (`shasum`) of trace_py.log and add it to the attempt log for reproducibility.\n    30→18. Note current git commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`) inside the trace README.\n    31→19. Record wall-clock runtime of the harness; large drifts may hint at hidden device switches.\n    32→20. Verify locks on reports directory (no leftover write permissions issues) before proceeding.\n    33→21. Snapshot `env | sort` into the attempt log to document environment variables used.\n    34→22. After editing docs, re-open them to confirm UTF-8 encoding only—no stray BOM characters.\n    35→23. Stage files incrementally and run `git diff --cached` to ensure only evidence files appear.\n    36→24. Draft the docs/fix_plan attempt entry in a scratch buffer before committing to avoid typos.\n    37→25. Re-read the updated plan row to make sure guidance still matches the recorded artifacts.\n    38→\n    39→Priorities & Rationale:\n    40→- plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:127 keeps H5c open; new traces are prerequisite for K2/K3.\n    41→- docs/fix_plan.md:470-517 demands refreshed pix0 evidence plus scaling reruns before normalization continues.\n    42→- reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md:6-18 now warns that current metrics predate Attempt #33.\n    43→- specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120 mandates <5e-5 m pix0 tolerance; we must document compliance.\n    44→\n    45→How-To Map:\n    46→- Export `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` for every python invocation; without it the harness may trip MKL.\n    47→- Run the Do Now command from repo root so relative paths resolve; capture stdout with `tee` to keep a textual artifact.\n    48→- Use `python -m filecmp` or `diff -u` to compare new trace against `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-22/trace_py.log`; record key differences.\n    49→- Update `parity_summary.md` by replacing the dated metrics table with the new numbers, noting pass/fail for pix0, F/S beams, and F_latt.\n    50→- In docs/fix_plan.md, add Attempt #35 under CLI-FLAGS-003 with metrics (Δpix0, ΔFbeam, ΔSbeam, F_latt ratio) plus artifact references.\n    51→- Stage only report/doc updates; leave git tree clean except for these evidence files.\n    52→\n    53→Trace Checklist:\n    54→- pix0_vector_meters (three components) — confirm Δ < 5e-5 m vs C trace.\n    55→- Fbeam/Sbeam scalars — ensure conversion now matches C within tolerance.\n    56→- hkl_frac triplet — verify rounding to (2,2,-13) persists.\n    57→- F_latt_a/b/c and product — expect close agreement with C once K1 fix in place.\n    58→- omega_pixel_sr and polar — note values but defer detailed analysis to Phase K2.\n    59→\n    60→Pitfalls To Avoid:\n    61→- Do not rerun C trace; existing 2025-10-22 artifacts remain the comparator for this loop.\n    62→- Skip pytest/nb-compare entirely—Evidence gate forbids test execution.\n    63→- Resist tweaking simulator code; today is documentation + trace capture only.\n    64→- Avoid creating new directories outside `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/`.\n    65→- Keep device/dtype neutral commentary; trace harness already respects configs.\n    66→- Protect docs/index.md and other protected assets per CLAUDE.md instructions.\n    67→- Document every command in attempt log to maintain reproducibility.\n    68→- If CUDA warms up unexpectedly, note it but do not debug—you’re on CPU path here.\n    69→- Leave NB_RUN_PARALLEL unset so parity pytest stays skipped.\n    70→- Don’t forget to commit/push the updated reports;

The debugging approach is built around a parallel trace comparison between the C code and the PyTorch implementation to ensure correctness and facilitate rapid issue resolution.\n    10→\n    11→## Core Debugging Philosophy\n    12→\n    13→### Parallel Trace Comparison Rule\n    14→\n    15→**CRITICAL:** All debugging of physics discrepancies MUST begin with a parallel trace comparison. This involves:\n    16→1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the \"Golden Trace\").\n    17→2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n    18→3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.\n    19→\n    20→This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.\n    21→\n    22→## Debugging Workflow (SOP-4.1)\n    23→\n    24→Follow the specialized PyTorch physics debugging process documented in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (see the Parallel Validation Matrix section):\n    25→\n    26→1. **Identify an On-Peak Pixel:** Run the PyTorch simulation and visually inspect the output image to find the coordinates of a bright pixel on a Bragg peak.\n    27→2. **Generate Golden C Trace:** Add trace printf statements to `nanoBragg.c` around the calculation of interest (e.g., detector geometry, scattering vectors). Recompile with `make -C golden_suite_generator` and run with your test parameters, redirecting stderr to capture the trace log.\n    28→3. **Generate PyTorch Trace:** Create a debug script (e.g., `scripts/debug_beam_pivot_trace.py`) that replicates the exact calculation with matching trace output format.\n    29→4. **Compare Traces:** Use a diff tool (`diff`, `vimdiff`, etc.) to compare the C trace and the PyTorch trace.\n    30→5. **Identify Divergence Point:** Find the first variable where the numerical values differ significantly. This is the location of the bug.\n    31→6. **Isolate and Fix:** Examine the PyTorch code responsible for calculating the divergent variable. Check for common issues:\n    32→   - Unit conversion errors (e.g., meters vs. Angstroms).\n    33→   - Incorrect physical constants.\n    34→   - Mismatched mathematical formulas or conventions.\n    35→7. **Apply Fix and Re-validate:** Apply the fix and re-run the PyTorch trace. Repeat the comparison until the logs match.\n    36→\n    37→## Debug Script and Trace Management\n    38→\n    39→### Active PyTorch Debug Script\n    40→\n    41→**Script:** `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`  \n    42→**Purpose:** Generates the PyTorch side of the parallel trace comparison.\n    43→\n    44→### Golden C-Code Trace\n    45→\n    46→**Source:** Generated by adding printf statements to `nanoBragg.c` in `golden_suite_generator/`.  \n    47→**Example instrumentation:**\n    48→```c\n    49→/* Add trace output for detector geometry */\n    50→printf(\"TRACE_C: fdet_vector %.15g %.15g %.15g\\n\", fdet_vector[1], fdet_vector[2], fdet_vector[3]);\n    51→printf(\"TRACE_C: pix0_vector %.15g %.15g %.15g\\n\", pix0_vector[1], pix0_vector[2], pix0_vector[3]);\n    52→```\n    53→**Purpose:** Provides the \"ground truth\" intermediate values for the physics calculation.  \n    54→**Management:** Remove trace statements after debugging is complete to avoid cluttering output.\n    55→\n    56→### Trace Schema (names, units, precision)\n    57→\n    58→To ensure deterministic comparison between C and PyTorch traces, use the following conventions:\n    59→\n    60→- Prefixes: `TRACE_C:` for C-code; `TRACE_PY:` for PyTorch.\n    61→- Variable names: keep identical tokens across implementations (e.g., `pix0_vector`, `fdet_vector`, `sdet_vector`, `odet_vector`, `Fbeam`, `Sbeam`, `pixel_pos_meters`, `diffracted_vec`, `scattering_vec_A_inv`, `hkl_frac`, `F_cell`, `F_latt`, `omega_pixel`).\n    62→- Units:\n    63→  -

This document will save you 4-8 hours by identifying common issues:\n    91→    - Unit system confusion (Detector uses meters internally, not Angstroms)\n    92→    - MOSFLM convention axis swap and +0.5 pixel offset\n    93→    - Undocumented CUSTOM convention switching\n    94→    - Known C code logging bugs\n    95→    - **Failure to read this checklist will result in DAYS of unnecessary debugging!**\n    96→\n    97→0.  **Configuration Parity is Mandatory:** Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult the [C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md). This document is the single source of truth for all parameter mappings and implicit C-code conventions. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:\n    98→    - Implicit pivot mode logic (e.g., `-twotheta` implies SAMPLE pivot)\n    99→    - Convention-dependent beam center calculations (MOSFLM adds 0.5 pixel adjustment)\n   100→    - Rotation axis defaults (MOSFLM uses Y-axis, XDS uses X-axis for twotheta)\n   101→    - Unit conversions (mm→m, degrees→radians)\n   102→\n   103→0.  **Instrumentation / Tracing Discipline:** Never re-derive physics or duplicate algorithms in trace/debug code. Instrumentation must reuse the production helpers or cached intermediates so traces reflect the exact values the main path computed (see [Architecture Hub](./docs/architecture/README.md#⚠️-trace-instrumentation-rule)). Parallel \"trace-only\" implementations inevitably drift and make parity debugging unreliable.\n   104→\n   105→1.  **Units (canonical in spec/arch):** Use the conversions and detector hybrid exception exactly as defined in `specs/spec-a.md` (Units & Geometry) and summarized in `arch.md` and `docs/architecture/detector.md`.\n   106→\n   107→2.  **Crystallographic Convention (by design):** Compute h,k,l via real‑space dot (see `specs/spec-a.md` Physics for the authoritative statement).\n   108→\n   109→3.  **Differentiability:** Follow `arch.md` Differentiability Guidelines (no `.item()` on grad tensors, avoid `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints, derive via functions/properties) and require `torch.autograd.gradcheck` for parameters.\n   110→\n   111→4.  **Coordinate System & Image Orientation:** This project uses a `(slow, fast)` pixel indexing convention, consistent with `matplotlib.imshow(origin='lower')` and `fabio`.\n   112→    -   **Action:** Ensure all `torch.meshgrid` calls use `indexing=\"ij\"` to produce `(slow, fast)` grids.\n   113→    -   **Verification:** When comparing to external images (like the Golden Suite), always confirm the axis orientation. A 90-degree rotation in the diff image is a classic sign of an axis swap.\n   114→\n   115→5.  **Parallel Trace Debugging is Mandatory:** All debugging of physics discrepancies **MUST** begin with a parallel trace comparison.\n   116→    -   **Action:** Generate a step-by-step log from the instrumented C code and an identical log from the PyTorch script (`scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`). Compare these two files to find the first line where they numerically diverge. **Before comparing, consult the component contract in `docs/architecture/` to verify the expected units of all variables in the trace log.**\n   117→    -   **Reference:** See `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` for the strategy and `docs/debugging/debugging.md` for the detailed workflow.\n   118→    -   **Key Scripts:** The primary script for end-to-end validation is `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py`. It uses helper modules `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` to execute the C code and `scripts/smv_parser.py` to read the output images. For single-pixel, step-by-step debugging, use `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n   119→\n   120→6.  **PyTorch Environment Variable:** All PyTorch code execution **MUST** set the environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to prevent MKL library conflicts.\n   121→    -   **Action:** Either set `os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'TRUE'` in Python before importing torch, or prefix command-line calls with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.\n   122→    -   **Reason:** Prevents \"Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libiomp5.dylib already initialized\" crashes when multiple libraries (PyTorch, NumPy) load MKL runtime.\n   123→    -   **Verification:** All Python scripts and tests that import torch must include this environment variable setting.\n   124→\n   125→7.  **Differentiable Programming Principles:** All PyTorch code **MUST** maintain computational graph connectivity for gradient flow.\n   126→    -   **Action:** Avoid functions that explicitly detach tensors from the computation graph within a differentiable code path.\n   127→    -   **Forbidden:** Using `.item()`, `.numpy()`, or `.detach()` on a tensor that requires a gradient, as this will sever the gradient path.\n   128→    -   **Correct:** Pass tensors directly through the computation pipeline. Use Python-level control flow (like `isinstance`) to handle different input types gracefully, but ensure the core operations are performed on tensors.\n   129→    -   **Known Limitation:** Be aware that some PyTorch functions, like `torch.linspace`, do not propagate gradients to their `start` and `end` arguments. In such cases, a manual, differentiable implementation using basic tensor operations (e.g., `torch.arange`) is required.\n   130→    -   **Verification:** All differentiable parameters must have passing `torch.autograd.gradcheck` tests.\n   131→\n   132→8.  **Preserve C-Code References Until Feature-Complete:** C-code quotes in docstrings serve as a roadmap for unimplemented features. They **MUST NOT** be removed until the corresponding feature is fully implemented, tested, and validated.\n   133→    -   **Action:** When implementing a feature described by a C-code quote, leave the quote in place. Once the feature is complete and all its tests (including integration and gradient tests) are passing, the quote may be updated or removed if it no longer adds value beyond the implemented code.\n   134→    -   **Example:** A docstring for an unimplemented function should retain its C-code reference. A docstring for a partially implemented function (e.g., `phi` rotation is done but `misset` is not) should retain the C-code reference for the unimplemented part, clearly marked as \"Future Work\".\n   135→    -   **Verification:** Before removing any C-code reference, confirm that the functionality it describes is covered by a passing test in the test suite.\n   136→\n   137→9.  **Never Use `.item()` on Differentiable Tensors:** The `.item()` method **MUST NOT** be used on any tensor that needs to remain differentiable.\n   138→    -   **Action:** Pass tensors directly to configuration objects and functions instead of extracting scalar values.\n   139→    -   **Forbidden:** `config = Config(param=tensor.item())` - This permanently severs the computation graph.\n   140→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=tensor)` - Preserves gradient flow.\n   141→    -   **Verification:** Any use of `.item()` must be followed by verification that the tensor is not needed for gradient computation.\n   142→\n   143→9.  **Avoid `torch.linspace` for Gradient-Critical Code:** `torch.linspace` does not preserve gradients from tensor endpoints.\n   144→    -   **Action:** Use manual tensor arithmetic for differentiable range generation: `start + step_size * torch.arange(...)`.\n   145→    -   **Forbidden:** `torch.linspace(start_tensor, end_tensor, steps)` where `start_tensor` or `end_tensor` require gradients.\n   146→    -   **Correct:** `start_tensor + (end_tensor - start_tensor) * torch.arange(steps) / (steps - 1)`.\n   147→    -   **Verification:** Check that generated ranges preserve `requires_grad=True` when input tensors require gradients.\n   148→\n   149→10. **Boundary Enforcement for Type Safety:** Use clean architectural boundaries to handle tensor/scalar conversions.\n   150→    -   **Action:** Core methods assume tensor inputs; type conversions happen at call sites.\n   151→    -   **Forbidden:** `isinstance(param, torch.Tensor)` checks inside core computational methods.\n   152→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=torch.tensor(value))` at boundaries, `def core_method(tensor_param)` in implementation.\n   153→    -   **Verification:** Core methods should not contain type checking logic; all parameters should be tensors with consistent device/dtype.\n   154→\n   155→11. **C-Code Reference Template (MANDATORY FOR ALL PORTED FUNCTIONS):**\n   156→    -   **Action:** When implementing ANY function that ports logic from nanoBragg.c, you MUST:\n   157→        1. FIRST create the function stub with the docstring template below\n   158→        2. THEN fill in the C-code reference BEFORE writing any implementation\n   159→        3. ONLY THEN proceed with the Python implementation\n   160→    -   **Template:**\n   161→        ```python\n   162→        def function_name(self, ...):\n   163→            \"\"\"\n   164→            Brief description of function purpose.\n   165→            \n   166→            C-Code Implementation Reference (from nanoBragg.c, lines XXXX-YYYY):\n   167→            ```c\n   168→            [PASTE EXACT C-CODE HERE - DO NOT PARAPHRASE]\n   169→            ```\n   170→            \n   171→            Args:\n   172→                ...\n   173→            Returns:\n   174→                ...\n   175→            \"\"\"\n   176→            # Implementation goes here\n   177→        ```\n   178→    -   **Forbidden:** Writing the implementation before adding the C-code reference\n   179→    -   **Verification:** Before marking any implementation task complete, verify C-code reference exists\n   180→    -   **Rationale:** This is not just for human readability; it is a critical part of our trace-driven validation strategy. It provides a direct, in-code link between the new implementation and its ground-truth reference, which is essential for debugging and verification. Failure to include this reference is considered an implementation error.\n   181→\n   182→12. **Critical Data Flow Convention: The Misset Rotation Pipeline**\n   183→\n   184→    **This rule is non-negotiable and describes a non-standard data flow that MUST be replicated exactly.** The static misset orientation is integrated into the lattice vector calculation in a specific sequence.\n   185→\n   186→    The correct, end-to-end data flow is:\n   187→    1.  Calculate the **base** real (`a,b,c`) and reciprocal (`a*,b*,c*`) vectors from the six unit cell parameters in a canonical orientation.\n   188→    2.  Apply the static misset rotation matrix to **only the reciprocal vectors** (`a*,b*,c*`).\n   189→    3.  **Crucially, recalculate the real-space vectors (`a,b,c`) from the newly rotated reciprocal vectors** using the standard crystallographic relationship (e.g., `a = (b* x c*) * V`).\n   190→    4.  These recalculated, misset-aware real-space vectors are then passed to the dynamic rotation pipeline (`get_rotated_real_vectors`) and are ultimately used in the simulator's Miller index calculation (`h = S·a`).\n   191→\n   192→    **Rationale:** This specific sequence is how `nanoBragg.c` ensures the static orientation is correctly propagated. Any deviation will cause the simulation to fail validation against the golden test cases.\n   193→\n   194→13. **Reciprocal Vector Recalculation for Self-Consistency**\n   195→\n   196→    **The C-code performs a circular recalculation that MUST be replicated for exact metric duality.** After building initial reciprocal vectors and calculating real vectors from them, the C-code recalculates the reciprocal vectors using the standard formula.\n   197→\n   198→    The complete sequence is:\n   199→    1. Build initial reciprocal vectors using the default orientation convention\n   200→    2. Calculate real vectors from reciprocal: `a = (b* × c*) × V`\n   201→    3. **Recalculate reciprocal vectors from real**: `a* = (b × c) / V_actual`\n   202→    4. **Use actual volume**: `V_actual = a · (b × c)` instead of the formula volume\n   203→\n   204→    **Critical:** The volume from the actual vectors differs slightly (~0.6% for triclinic cells) from the formula volume. Using V_actual ensures perfect metric duality (a·a* = 1 exactly).\n   205→\n   206→    **Verification:** The `test_metric_duality` test must pass with `rtol=1e-12`.\n   207→\n   208→14. **Mandatory Component Contracts:** For any non-trivial component port (e.g., `Detector`, `Crystal`), the first step of the implementation phase **MUST** be to author (or consult, if it exists) a complete technical specification in `docs/architecture/[component_name].md`. This contract is the authoritative source for all conventions, units, and logic flows. Implementation must not begin until this document is complete.\n   209→\n   210→15. **Detector Geometry Conventions:** The Detector component follows specific conventions that **MUST** be preserved:\n   211→    -   **Coordinate System:** Lab frame with beam along +X axis, right-handed system, sample at origin\n   212→    -   **Pixel Indexing:** `(slow, fast)` order using `torch.meshgrid(..., indexing=\"ij\")`\n   213→    -   **Pixel Reference:** Integer indices refer to pixel **leading edge/corner**, not center\n   214→    -   **Rotation Order:** detector_rotx → detector_roty → detector_rotz → detector_twotheta\n   215→    -   **Convention Dependency:** MOSFLM vs XDS affects initial basis vectors and twotheta axis\n   216→    -   **Unit Handling:** User config in mm/degrees, internal calculations in Angstroms/radians\n   217→    -   **Pivot Modes:** BEAM pivot (around beam spot) vs SAMPLE pivot (around sample position)\n   218→    -   **Verification:** All detector tests must pass, including basis vector orthonormality and gradient flow\n   219→\n   220→16. **PyTorch Device & Dtype Neutrality:** Implementation MUST work for CPU and GPU tensors and for all supported dtypes without silent device transfers.\n   221→    -   **Action:** Accept tensors on whatever device/dtype the caller provides; use helper utilities (`to()`/`type_as()`) to coerce internal temporaries to the dominant device/dtype instead of hard-coding `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` or allocating new CPU tensors mid-pipeline.\n   222→    -   **Verification:** Add (or update) smoke tests that exercise both CPU and CUDA execution whenever a code path touches tensor math; at minimum, run the authoritative command once with `device=cpu` and once with `device=cuda` (when available) before marking work complete. Treat any Dynamo/compile warnings about mixed devices as failures to resolve immediately.\n   223→    -   **Forbidden:** Leaving datasets, constants, or configuration tensors on default CPU while multiplying by GPU intermediates; relying on implicit device promotion; assuming float64/CPU execution in production paths.\n   224→    -   **Scope:** This applies across the project and to any future PyTorch work you undertake—make code device/dtype agnostic by default.\n   225→\n   226→17. **Tooling & Benchmark Placement:** Benchmark, profiling, and diagnostic scripts SHALL live under structured tooling directories (`scripts/benchmarks/`, `scripts/profiling/`, etc.) and follow the repo’s CLI/env conventions.\n   227→    -   **Action:** When creating or modifying benchmarking utilities, place them under `scripts/…`, require `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, resolve binaries via the documented precedence, and record authoritative commands in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or the relevant tooling index).\n   228→    -   **Forbidden:** Dropping standalone benchmarking files in the repo root or bypassing the editable-install expectation with ad-hoc `sys.path` tweaks.\n   229→    -   **Verification:** Update `docs/fix_plan.md` (Suite/Tooling section) with reproduction commands and results every time a benchmark uncovers an issue; ensure CI/docs reference the canonical script location.\n   230→\n   231→## Crystallographic Conventions\n   232→\n   233→This project adheres to the `|G| = 1/d` convention, where `G = h*a* + k*b* + l*c*`. This is equivalent to the `|Q| = 2π/d` convention where `Q = 2πG`. All tests and calculations must be consistent with this standard.\n   234→\n   235→**Default Orientation Matrix**: The project uses the nanoBragg.c convention for constructing the default orientation of reciprocal lattice vectors from cell parameters:\n   236→- a* is placed purely along the x-axis\n   237→- b* is placed in the x-y plane  \n   238→- c* fills out 3D space\n   239→\n   240→This specific orientation must be maintained for consistency with the C-code implementation.\n   241→\n   242→## Golden Test Case Specification (`simple_cubic`)\n   243→\n   244→**The exact `nanoBragg.c` commands used to generate all golden reference data are centrally documented in `tests/golden_data/README.md`.

batch operations for efficiency\n   378→- **Utils:** Implement gradient-safe versions of standard operations (ranges, interpolation)\n   379→\n   380→### Debugging Gradient Issues\n   381→\n   382→1. **Check requires_grad:** Verify input tensors have `requires_grad=True`\n   383→2. **Print computation graph:** Use `torchviz` or `tensorboard` to visualize graph\n   384→3. **Isolate breaks:** Binary search through operations to find where gradients stop\n   385→4. **Use retain_graph:** For debugging multiple backward passes\n   386→5. **Check autograd.grad:** Manually compute gradients for specific tensors\n   387→\n   388→### Reference Documentation\n   389→\n   390→For comprehensive details and examples:\n   391→- **Lessons learned:** `docs/development/lessons_in_differentiability.md` — real debugging cases and solutions\n   392→- **Design principles:** `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` — architectural patterns for differentiability\n   393→- **Testing strategy:** `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — Tier 2 gradient correctness methodology\n   394→- **Parameter trace:** `docs/architecture/parameter_trace_analysis.md` — understanding gradient flow paths\n   395→\n   396→### Verification Checklist\n   397→\n   398→- [ ] All `.item()` calls verified as non-differentiable paths\n   399→- [ ] No `torch.linspace` with gradient-requiring endpoints\n   400→- [ ] All derived properties use @property or functional patterns\n   401→- [ ] Type conversions happen only at boundaries\n   402→- [ ] `torch.autograd.gradcheck` passes for all parameters\n   403→- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end gradient flow\n   404→\n   405→**Remember:** Breaking differentiability breaks the fundamental value proposition of the PyTorch port — the ability to optimize physical parameters via gradient descent.\n   406→\n   407→## 16) Developer Notes\n   408→\n   409→- Maintain strict separation between geometry (meters) and physics (Å). Convert once at the interface.\n   410→- **Preserve differentiability at all costs:** Follow Section 15 guidelines religiously. This is non-negotiable for optimization capabilities.\n   411→- Cache only pure-geometry outputs; invalidate on config changes; keep unit tests focused and vectorized.\n   412→- Keep acceptance tests in specs/spec-b.md up-to-date with behavior; use them as the primary source of truth.\n   413→- **Before implementing any differentiable feature:** Review `docs/development/lessons_in_differentiability.md` to avoid known pitfalls.\n   414→- **Use @property pattern:** For all derived quantities (reciprocal vectors, rotated bases, etc.) to maintain gradient flow.\n   415→- **Test gradients early and often:** Don't wait until integration; verify gradients at the unit level first.\n   416→- **SAMPLE vs BEAM pivot tolerances:** BEAM pivot preserves beam center exactly (1e-6 tolerance), SAMPLE pivot has geometric constraints leading to ~3.5e-2 tolerance with large rotations. This matches C-code behavior.\n   417→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code.

Introduction & Philosophy\n     8→\n     9→This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.\n    10→Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:\n    11→\n    12→1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the \"ground truth\" specification.\n    13→2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.\n    14→3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.\n    15→\n    16→All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.\n    17→\n    18→### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline\n    19→\n    20→- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.\n    21→- **Authoritative smoke runs:** When a change touches tensor math, run the authoritative reproduction command once on CPU and once on CUDA (when available). Capture both logs/metrics and attach them to the fix plan. Treat any `torch.compile` or Dynamo warning about mixed devices as blocking.\n    22→- **Targeted tests:** Prefer parametrised tests that iterate over `device in {\"cpu\", \"cuda\"}` (guarded by `torch.cuda.is_available()`). At minimum, ensure a `gpu_smoke` marker or equivalent pytest node exercises the new logic on CUDA before declaring success.\n    23→- **Helper utilities:** Encapsulate device/dtype harmonisation in small helpers (e.g., `tensor.to(other_tensor)` or `type_as`). Centralise these helpers in reusable modules to keep the rule enforceable across future PyTorch projects.\n    24→- **CI gate:** If CI offers GPU runners, add a fast smoke job that runs the `gpu_smoke` marker (or agreed command) so regressions like CPU↔GPU tensor mixing fail quickly.\n    25→- **Vectorization check:** Confirm `_compute_physics_for_position` and related helpers remain batched across sources/phi/mosaic/oversample; extend broadcast dimensions instead of adding Python loops.\n    26→- **Runtime checklist:** Consult `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` during development and cite it in fix-plan notes for PyTorch changes.\n    27→\n    28→### 1.5 Loop Execution Notes (Do Now + Validation Scripts)\n    29→\n    30→- Do Now must include an exact pytest command: In the supervisor→engineer handoff (`input.md`), include the precise `pytest` node(s) that reproduce the active item. If no test exists, first author the minimal targeted test and then run it.\n    31→- Prefer reusable validation scripts: Place ad‑hoc validations under `scripts/validation/` and reference them from `input.md` rather than embedding Python snippets inline. Keep them portable and invoke via the project’s standard CLI/env.\n    32→- Test cadence per loop: Run targeted tests first; execute the full `pytest` suite at most once per engineer turn (end of loop) when code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, use `pytest --collect-only -q` to verify import/collection.\n    33→\n    34→## 2. Configuration Parity\n    35→\n    36→**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before implementing any test that compares against C-code output, you **MUST** ensure exact configuration parity. All golden test cases must be generated with commands that are verifiably equivalent to the PyTorch test configurations.\n    37→\n    38→**Authoritative Reference:** See the **[C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./c_to_pytorch_config_map.md)** for:\n    39→- Complete parameter mappings\n    40→- Implicit conventions (pivot modes, beam adjustments, rotation axes)\n    41→- Common configuration bugs and prevention strategies\n    42→\n    43→Configuration mismatches are the most common source of test failures. Always verify:\n    44→- Pivot mode (BEAM vs SAMPLE) based on parameter implications\n    45→- Convention-specific adjustments (e.g., MOSFLM's 0.5 pixel offset)\n    46→- Default rotation axes for each convention\n    47→- Proper unit conversions at boundaries\n    48→ - Explicit convention selection: tests and harnesses MUST pass `-convention` (or equivalent API flag) to avoid implicit CUSTOM switching when vector parameters are present\n    49→\n    50→\n    51→## 2.1 Ground Truth: Parallel Trace-Driven Validation\n    52→\n    53→The foundation of our testing strategy is a \"Golden Suite\" of test data. Crucially, final-output comparison is insufficient for effective debugging. Our strategy is therefore centered on **Parallel Trace-Driven Validation**.\n    54→\n    55→For each test case, the Golden Suite must contain three components:\n    56→1. **Golden Output Image:** The final .bin file from the C code.\n    57→2. **Golden C-Code Trace Log:** A detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the C code for a specific on-peak pixel.\n    58→3. **PyTorch Trace Log:** An identical, step-by-step log from the PyTorch implementation for the same pixel.\n    59→\n    60→This allows for direct, line-by-line comparison of the entire physics calculation, making it possible to pinpoint the exact line of code where a divergence occurs.\n    61→### 2.2 Instrumenting the C Code\n    62→\n    63→The `nanoBragg.c` source in `golden_suite_generator/` must be instrumented with a `-dump_pixel <slow> <fast>` command-line flag. When run with this flag, the program must write a detailed log file (`<test_case_name>_C_trace.log`) containing key intermediate variables (e.g., `scattering_vector`, `h`, `k`, `l`, `F_cell`, `F_latt`, `omega_pixel`, `polar`) for the specified pixel. This provides the ground truth for component-level testing.\n    64→\n    65→### 2.3 Golden Test Cases\n    66→\n    67→The following test cases will be defined, and all three artifacts (image, C trace, PyTorch trace) will be generated and stored in `tests/golden_data/`.\n    68→\n    69→| Test Case Name | Description | Purpose |\n    70→| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    71→| `simple_cubic` | A 100Å cubic cell, single wavelength, no mosaicity, no oscillation. | The \"hello world\" test for basic geometry and spot calculation. |\n    72→| `triclinic_P1` | A low-symmetry triclinic cell with misset orientation. | To stress-test the reciprocal space and geometry calculations. |\n    73→| `simple_cubic_mosaic` | The `simple_cubic` case with mosaic spread. | To test the mosaic domain implementation. |\n    74→| `cubic_tilted_detector` | Cubic cell with rotated and tilted detector. | To test general detector geometry implementation. |\n    75→\n    76→### 2.4 Canonical Generation Commands\n    77→\n    78→**⚠️ CRITICAL:** The following commands are the **single source of truth** for reproducing the golden data.

For each parameter, a test will be created that:\n   386→    1.  Sets up a minimal, fast-to-run simulation scenario.\n   387→    2.  Defines a function that takes the parameter tensor as input and returns a scalar loss.\n   388→    3.  Calls `gradcheck` on this function and its input.\n   389→*   **Requirement:** The following parameters (at a minimum) must pass `gradcheck`:\n   390→    *   **Crystal:** `cell_a`, `cell_gamma`, `misset_rot_x`\n   391→    *   **Detector:** `distance_mm`, `Fbeam_mm`\n   392→    *   **Beam:** `lambda_A`\n   393→    *   **Model:** `mosaic_spread_rad`, `fluence`\n   394→\n   395→### 4.2 Multi-Tier Gradient Testing\n   396→\n   397→**Comprehensive gradient testing requires multiple levels of verification:**\n   398→\n   399→#### 4.2.1 Unit-Level Gradient Tests\n   400→- **Target:** Individual components like `get_rotated_real_vectors`\n   401→- **Purpose:** Verify gradients flow correctly through isolated functions\n   402→- **Example:**\n   403→  ```python\n   404→  def test_rotation_gradients():\n   405→      phi_start = torch.tensor(10.0, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float64)\n   406→      config = CrystalConfig(phi_start_deg=phi_start)\n   407→      rotated_vectors = crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors(config)\n   408→      assert rotated_vectors[0].requires_grad\n   409→      assert torch.autograd.gradcheck(lambda x: crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors(\n   410→          CrystalConfig(phi_start_deg=x))[0].sum(), phi_start)\n   411→  ```\n   412→\n   413→#### 4.2.2 Integration-Level Gradient Tests\n   414→- **Target:** End-to-end `Simulator.run()` method\n   415→- **Purpose:** Verify gradients flow through complete simulation chain\n   416→- **Critical:** All configuration parameters must be tensors to preserve gradient flow\n   417→\n   418→#### 4.2.3 Gradient Stability Tests\n   419→- **Target:** Parameter ranges and edge cases\n   420→- **Purpose:** Verify gradients remain stable across realistic parameter variations\n   421→- **Example:**\n   422→  ```python\n   423→  def test_gradient_stability():\n   424→      for phi_val in [0.0, 45.0, 90.0, 180.0]:\n   425→          phi_start = torch.tensor(phi_val, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float64)\n   426→          config = CrystalConfig(phi_start_deg=phi_start)\n   427→          result = simulator.run_with_config(config)\n   428→          assert result.requires_grad\n   429→  ```\n   430→\n   431→#### 4.2.4 Gradient Flow Debugging\n   432→- **Purpose:** Systematic approach to diagnose gradient breaks\n   433→- **Methodology:**\n   434→  1. **Isolation:** Create minimal test case with `requires_grad=True`\n   435→  2. **Tracing:** Check `requires_grad` at each computation step\n   436→  3. **Break Point Identification:** Find where gradients are lost\n   437→  4. **Common Causes:**\n   438→     - `.item()` calls on differentiable tensors (detaches from computation graph)\n   439→     - `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints (known PyTorch limitation)\n   440→     - Manual tensor overwriting instead of functional computation\n   441→     - Using `.detach()` or `.numpy()` on tensors that need gradients\n   442→\n   443→## 5.

Configure a simple case: cubic cell, beam along Z, detector on XY plane, no rotations.\n   453→        2.  Analytically calculate the exact (x,y) position of a low-index reflection (e.g., (1,0,0)) using the Bragg equation and simple trigonometry.\n   454→        3.  Run the simulation.\n   455→        4.  Find the coordinates of the brightest pixel in the output image using `torch.argmax`.\n   456→        5.  Assert that the simulated spot position is within one pixel of the analytically calculated position.\n   457→    *   **`test_polarization_limits`:**\n   458→        1.  Configure a reflection to be at exactly 90 degrees 2-theta.\n   459→        2.  Run the simulation with polarization set to horizontal. Assert the spot intensity is near maximum.\n   460→        3.  Run again with polarization set to vertical. Assert the spot intensity is near zero.\n   461→\n   462→## 6. Tooling & Benchmark Hygiene\n   463→\n   464→- **Directory layout:** Place benchmarks, profilers, and ad-hoc tooling under `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py`). Do not add standalone executables to the repo root.\n   465→- **Environment parity:** All tooling must honour the same environment contract as the tests (`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, `NB_C_BIN` precedence, editable install). Scripts SHOULD exit with a non-zero status if prerequisites are missing.\n   466→- **Plan integration:** When a benchmark exposes a regression, log the command, metrics, and artifact path under `docs/fix_plan.md` › `## Suite Failures` or the relevant tracking section.\n   467→- **Generalisation:** These expectations apply to any PyTorch project you touch—structure tooling predictably, rely on documented env vars, and keep benchmark commands discoverable through project docs.\n   468→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Pivot mode (SAMPLE) calculation differs from C despite identical detector_pivot setting\n  2. Custom vector projection math has a unit conversion error\n  3. MOSFLM +0.5 pixel offset applied at wrong stage in pix0 calculation\n  4. Beam-center values used in pix0 calculation come from a different source than those fixed in H5e\n\n### Phase K Readiness Assessment\n⚠️ **BLOCKED** - The 1.1mm pix0 error will cascade into:\n- Incorrect Miller index calculations (h/k/l off by several tenths)\n- Invalid F_latt comparisons (already evident: C values unknown, PyTorch=64.949)\n- Unreliable intensity scaling validation\n\n**Recommendation:** **Pause Phase K work and open Phase H6 to resolve pix0 discrepancy before resuming normalization.**\n\n## Next Steps (Proposed Phase H6)\n\n1. **H6a - Instrument pix0 calculation path:**\n   - Add targeted printf statements in `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector()` showing:\n     - Input beam_center values (pre- and post-conversion)\n     - Pivot mode logic flow\n     - MOSFLM offset application\n     - Final pix0 components\n\n2. **H6b - Generate comparative pix0 trace:**\n   - Run instrumented Python with same parameters as C\n   - Identify first divergence point in pix0 calculation chain\n\n3. **H6c - Fix root cause:**\n   - Apply corrective logic based on divergence analysis\n   - Verify ΔF, ΔS, ΔO all fall below 50μm threshold\n\n4. **H6d - Rerun H5c:**\n   - Capture post-H6c PyTorch traces\n   - Confirm pix0 parity before Phase K resumes\n\n## Verification Status\n\n✅ **Trace captured** — 2025-10-24 PyTorch trace in `py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout`\n✅ **Delta analysis complete** — Metrics computed and documented above\n⚠️ **Parity NOT achieved** — Pix0 errors exceed threshold (ΔF=-1136μm, ΔS=+139μm)\n⚠️ **Attempt #33 ineffective** — Beam-center fix did not impact pix0 calculation\n🔄 **Phase H6 required** — Additional debugging needed before Phase K can proceed\n\n## Artifacts\n\n- **C Baseline Trace:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`\n- **PyTorch Trace (2025-10-24):** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout`\n- **C Precedence Proof:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`\n- **Implementation Notes:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/implementation_notes.md`\n- **Delta Analysis:** Inline above (Pix0 Vector Comparison table)\n\n## References\n- Plan checkpoint: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H5/H5c\n- Fix plan entry: `docs/fix_plan.md` §[CLI-FLAGS-003] Attempt #35 (this loop)\n- Unit fix commit: Attempt #33 (commit 831b670, H5e task)\n- Custom-vector revert: Attempt #31 (H5b task)\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":375,"cache_read_input_tokens":97799,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":375,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4ffad1ef-7ae5-4a19-a609-0a88630ac89e","uuid":"a395da1f-a85e-435a-9fd5-d9643212ce50"}

Pix0 deltas identical to 2025-10-22 baseline, indicating the underlying pix0 discrepancy remains unresolved.**\n\n### Code Changes (Prior Work)\n**File:** `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`\n\n1. **H5b - Restored custom-vector guard** (Attempt #31, lines ≈518-540):\n   - Added `has_custom_vectors = any([...])` helper mirroring C precedence.\n   - Gated pix0 override projection with `if pix0_override_tensor is not None and not has_custom_vectors:`.\n   - Refreshed comments to cite `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`.\n\n2. **H5e - Beam-center unit correction** (Attempt #33, lines 490-515):\n   - Changed BEAM pivot Fbeam/Sbeam calculation to use `self.config.beam_center_f / 1000.0` instead of pixel-based values.\n   - Addressed observed 1.1mm ΔF error from 2025-10-22 trace analysis.\n   - **Result: Unit fix confirmed effective for CLI tests but did NOT impact pix0 vector in custom-vector scenarios.**\n\n### Regression Test Results\n**Command:** `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_flags.py::TestCLIPix0Override -v`\n\n**Results:** ✅ **4 passed** (H5b revert validation)\n✅ **26 passed** (H5e unit fix validation, all CLI flags)\n\n## Parity Metrics (Phase H5c — 2025-10-24 Post-Attempt #33)\n\n**Command:**\n```bash\nexport NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg\nexport KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE\nexport PYTHONPATH=src\npython reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py \\\n  --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log\n```\n\n**Pixel:** (slow=1039, fast=685)\n**C Baseline:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`\n**Threshold:** <5e-5 m (<50 μm per component)\n\n### Pix0 Vector Comparison\n\n| Component | C Value (m) | PyTorch (2025-10-24) | Delta (m) | Delta (μm) | Status |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|------------|--------|\n| pix0_S | -0.216475836205 | -0.216336513669 | +1.393e-04 | +139.3 | ⚠️ **FAIL** |\n| pix0_F | 0.216343050492 | 0.215206681073 | -1.136e-03 | -1136.4 | ⚠️ **FAIL** |\n| pix0_O | -0.230192414301 | -0.230198008547 | -5.594e-06 | -5.6 | ✅ **PASS** |\n| **Magnitude** | — | — | **1.145e-03** | **1144.9** | ⚠️ **FAIL** |\n\n### Detector Basis Vectors\n\n| Vector | C Value | PyTorch Value | Delta | Status |\n|--------|---------|---------------|-------|--------|\n| fdet | 0.999982, -0.005998, -0.000118 | 0.999982, -0.005998, -0.000118 | 0.0 | ✅ **PASS** |\n| sdet | -0.005998, -0.99997, -0.004913 | -0.005998, -0.99997, -0.004913 | 0.0 | ✅ **PASS** |\n\n### Physics Calculation Metrics\n\n| Variable | C Value | PyTorch Value (2025-10-24) | Delta | Notes |\n|----------|---------|----------------------------|-------|-------|\n| hkl_frac | (not logged) | (2.098, 2.017, -12.871) | N/A | ⏳ Awaiting C instrumentation |\n| hkl_rounded | (not logged) | (2, 2, -13) | N/A | |\n| F_latt_a | (not logged) | -3.294 | N/A | ⏳ Phase K1 parity |\n| F_latt_b | (not logged) | 10.815 | N/A | |\n| F_latt_c | (not logged) | -1.823 | N/A | |\n| F_latt (product) | (not logged) | 64.949 | N/A | |\n| F_cell | (not logged) | 300.58 | N/A | HKL interpolation value |\n| I_before_scaling | (not logged) | 3.811e8 | N/A | |\n| I_pixel_final | (not logged) | 0.003838 | N/A | |\n| omega_pixel_sr | (not logged) | 4.169e-07 | N/A | |\n| polar | (not logged) | 1.0 | N/A | Confirms Attempt #26 fix |\n\n### Critical Findings\n\n1. **⚠️ Attempt #33 Had NO Impact on Pix0:**\n   - Pix0 deltas are **identical** to 2025-10-22 baseline (before Attempt #33).\n   - ΔF remains at -1136.4 μm (1.136 mm), ΔS at +139.3 μm.\n   - This indicates the beam-center mm→m fix targeted a **different code path** than the one computing pix0 in custom-vector scenarios.\n\n2. **✅ Detector Basis Vectors Match Perfectly:**\n   - fdet and sdet vectors identical to C, confirming detector orientation is correct.\n   - Rotation matrix application validated.\n\n3. **⚠️ Pix0 Discrepancy Root Cause Unknown:**\n   - The 1.1mm fast-axis error persists despite:\n     - Custom-vector guard restoration (H5b)\n     - Beam-center unit conversion fix (H5e)\n     - All CLI tests passing\n   - Hypothesis: Pix0 calculation in `_calculate_pix0_vector()` may have a **separate unit conversion or pivot-mode logic error** not addressed by H5e.\n\n4. **🔍 Missing C Instrumentation:**\n   - F_latt components, fractional h/k/l, and per-pixel intensities not logged in C trace.\n   - Phase K1 will require additional C printf statements for lattice factor validation.\n\n## Immediate Analysis & Recommendations\n\n### Pix0 Delta Pattern Analysis\nThe persistent error pattern (S: +139μm, F: -1136μm, O: -5.6μm) suggests:\n- **Systematic bias in fast-axis calculation** (10× larger than slow-axis error)\n- Likely causes:\n  1. Pivot mode (SAMPLE) calculation differs from C despite identical detector_pivot setting\n  2. Custom vector projection math has a unit conversion error\n  3. MOSFLM +0.5 pixel offset applied at wrong stage in pix0 calculation\n  4. Beam-center values used in pix0 calculation come from a different source than those fixed in H5e\n\n### Phase K Readiness Assessment\n⚠️ **BLOCKED** - The 1.1mm pix0 error will cascade into:\n- Incorrect Miller index calculations (h/k/l off by several tenths)\n- Invalid F_latt comparisons (already evident: C values unknown, PyTorch=64.949)\n- Unreliable intensity scaling validation\n\n**Recommendation:** **Pause Phase K work and open Phase H6 to resolve pix0 discrepancy before resuming normalization.**\n\n## Next Steps (Proposed Phase H6)\n\n1. **H6a - Instrument pix0 calculation path:**\n   - Add targeted printf statements in `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector()` showing:\n     - Input beam_center values (pre- and post-conversion)\n     - Pivot mode logic flow\n     - MOSFLM offset application\n     - Final pix0 components\n\n2. **H6b - Generate comparative pix0 trace:**\n   - Run instrumented Python with same parameters as C\n   - Identify first divergence point in pix0 calculation chain\n\n3. **H6c - Fix root cause:**\n   - Apply corrective logic based on divergence analysis\n   - Verify ΔF, ΔS, ΔO all fall below 50μm threshold\n\n4. **H6d - Rerun H5c:**\n   - Capture post-H6c PyTorch traces\n   - Confirm pix0 parity before Phase K resumes\n\n## Verification Status\n\n✅ **Trace captured** — 2025-10-24 PyTorch trace in `py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout`\n✅ **Delta analysis complete** — Metrics computed and documented above\n⚠️ **Parity NOT achieved** — Pix0 errors exceed threshold (ΔF=-1136μm, ΔS=+139μm)\n⚠️ **Attempt #33 ineffective** — Beam-center fix did not impact pix0 calculation\n🔄 **Phase H6 required** — Additional debugging needed before Phase K can proceed\n\n## Artifacts\n\n- **C Baseline Trace:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`\n- **PyTorch Trace (2025-10-24):** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout`\n- **C Precedence Proof:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_precedence_2025-10-22.md`\n- **Implementation Notes:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/implementation_notes.md`\n- **Delta Analysis:** Inline above (Pix0 Vector Comparison table)\n\n## References\n- Plan checkpoint: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase H5/H5c\n- Fix plan entry: `docs/fix_plan.md` §[CLI-FLAGS-003] Attempt #35 (this loop)\n- Unit fix commit: Attempt #33 (commit 831b670, H5e task)\n- Custom-vector revert: Attempt #31 (H5b task)\nEOFDOC\ncp /tmp/parity_summary_new.md reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md\necho \"File updated successfully\"","description":"Update parity summary with H5c findings"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6424,"cache_read_input_tokens":104854,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6424,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4ffad1ef-7ae5-4a19-a609-0a88630ac89e","uuid":"53e3592d-7f6a-4a1f-8533-1b37db2ef1bf"}

Attempt #33's beam-center mm→m fix had NO impact on pix0 calculation in custom-vector scenarios.\n\n### docs/fix_plan.md Delta\n**Added:** Attempt #35 entry documenting:\n- Evidence capture complete (H5c task)\n- Pix0 parity NOT achieved (ΔF=-1136μm, ΔS=+139μm)\n- Attempt #33 ineffective for custom-vector path\n- Hypothesis: `_calculate_pix0_vector()` has separate unit conversion or pivot-mode error\n- Next actions: **Phase H6 required** before Phase K can proceed\n\n### CLAUDE.md Updates\nNone required (evidence-only loop; no new commands or quirks discovered).\n\n### arch.md Updates\nNone required. Existing ADR-01 (Hybrid Unit System) and ADR-02 (Rotation Order) remain accurate. Pix0 discrepancy is an implementation bug, not an architectural decision.\n\n**Proposed arch.md note (for Phase H6):**\n> ADR-XX: Pix0 calculation in custom-vector scenarios requires separate validation path. The `_calculate_pix0_vector()` method uses distinct logic from `_configure_geometry()` and must explicitly convert beam-center values from mm→m when computing pix0 from custom detector vectors.\n\n### Next Most-Important Item\n**Phase H6 (new) — Pix0 Discrepancy Root Cause Analysis**\n\nPriority: **HIGH** (blocks Phase K normalization work)\n\nTasks:\n1. **H6a:** Instrument `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector()` with targeted print statements showing beam-center values, pivot logic, MOSFLM offset application\n2. **H6b:** Generate comparative pix0 trace (Python vs C), identify first divergence point\n3. **H6c:** Fix root cause based on divergence analysis\n4. **H6d:** Rerun H5c to confirm ΔF, ΔS, ΔO all below 50μm threshold\n\n**Rationale:** The 1.1mm pix0 error will cascade into incorrect Miller index calculations and invalidate all Phase K lattice factor comparisons. Must be resolved before normalization work can proceed.\n\n---\n\n## Loop Self-Checklist\n\n✅ **Module/layer check:** Evidence-only loop (no code changes); documentation updates only\n✅ **Spec sections quoted:** plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:127 (H5c task); specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120 (pix0 tolerance)\n✅ **Backpressure:** Evidence loop; no test execution required per input.md directive\n✅ **Full pytest run:** NOT APPLICABLE (evidence-only loop; test suite verification deferred to implementation loops)\n✅ **New problems documented:** Phase H6 added to docs/fix_plan.md (pix0 discrepancy must be resolved)\n✅ **Evidence pointers:** All artifacts documented with file:line references in parity_summary.md and fix_plan.md\n✅ **Scope:** Single module (evidence/documentation); no code changes, stayed within evidence gate"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":169,"cache_read_input_tokens":129133,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":169,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4ffad1ef-7ae5-4a19-a609-0a88630ac89e","uuid":"21fe3ed0-0c4c-42e1-a778-1e17fe80ed96"}

Diff against the 2025-10-22 C trace, refresh `parity_summary.md` with `|Δpix0| < 5e-5 m` and `F_latt` ratio within 1e-3, and log Attempt #35 before resuming Phase K.\n\n### Arch.md ADR Alignment\n- **ADR-01 (Hybrid Unit System):** Confirmed detector geometry uses meters internally; pix0 values compared at meter-level precision.\n- **ADR-02 (Rotation Order):** Basis vectors (fdet/sdet) match C exactly, validating rotation application.\n- **Spec parity threshold (specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120):** <5e-5 m (<50 μm) per pix0 component.\n\n### Search Summary\n**Evidence-only loop - no code search performed.** Artifacts:\n- C baseline trace: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/c_traces/2025-10-22/with_override.log`\n- PyTorch trace harness: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py` (existing)\n- Updated parity summary: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md`\n\n### Changes/Artifacts\n**Files Modified:**\n- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/parity_summary.md` — Updated with 2025-10-24 metrics, Phase H6 proposal\n- `docs/fix_plan.md` — Added Attempt #35 entry\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout` — Fresh PyTorch trace\n- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/README.md` — Trace command, environment, analysis\n- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/git_context.txt` — Git commit hash/log\n- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/env_snapshot.txt` — Environment variables\n- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.stdout.sha256` — Checksum\n\n### Test/Example Workflow\n**Command Executed:**\n```bash\nexport NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg\nexport KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE\nexport PYTHONPATH=src\npython reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h/trace_harness.py \\\n  --out reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_h5/py_traces/2025-10-24/trace_py.log\n```\n\n**Result:** Trace harness completed successfully (~3s runtime). No pytest execution (evidence-only loop per input.md).\n\n**Pix0 Delta Analysis:**\n| Component | C Value (m) | PyTorch (2025-10-24) | Delta (μm) | Status |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------------|------------|--------|\n| pix0_F | 0.216343050492 | 0.215206681073 | -1136.4 | ⚠️ FAIL |\n| pix0_S | -0.216475836205 | -0.216336513669 | +139.3 | ⚠️ FAIL |\n| pix0_O | -0.230192414301 | -0.230198008547 | -5.6 | ✅ PASS |\n\n**Critical Finding:** Pix0 deltas **identical** to 2025-10-22 baseline (before Attempt #33). Attempt #33's beam-center mm→m fix had NO impact on pix0 calculation in custom-vector scenarios.\n\n### docs/fix_plan.md Delta\n**Added:** Attempt #35 entry documenting:\n- Evidence capture complete (H5c task)\n- Pix0 parity NOT achieved (ΔF=-1136μm, ΔS=+139μm)\n- Attempt #33 ineffective for custom-vector path\n- Hypothesis: `_calculate_pix0_vector()` has separate unit conversion or pivot-mode error\n- Next actions: **Phase H6 required** before Phase K can proceed\n\n### CLAUDE.md Updates\nNone required (evidence-only loop; no new commands or quirks discovered).\n\n### arch.md Updates\nNone required. Existing ADR-01 (Hybrid Unit System) and ADR-02 (Rotation Order) remain accurate. Pix0 discrepancy is an implementation bug, not an architectural decision.\n\n**Proposed arch.md note (for Phase H6):**\n> ADR-XX: Pix0 calculation in custom-vector scenarios requires separate validation path. The `_calculate_pix0_vector()` method uses distinct logic from `_configure_geometry()` and must explicitly convert beam-center values from mm→m when computing pix0 from custom detector vectors.\n\n### Next Most-Important Item\n**Phase H6 (new) — Pix0 Discrepancy Root Cause Analysis**\n\nPriority: **HIGH** (blocks Phase K normalization work)\n\nTasks:\n1. **H6a:** Instrument `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector()` with targeted print statements showing beam-center values, pivot logic, MOSFLM offset application\n2. **H6b:** Generate comparative pix0 trace (Python vs C), identify first divergence point\n3. **H6c:** Fix root cause based on divergence analysis\n4. **H6d:** Rerun H5c to confirm ΔF, ΔS, ΔO all below 50μm threshold\n\n**Rationale:** The 1.1mm pix0 error will cascade into incorrect Miller index calculations and invalidate all Phase K lattice factor comparisons. Must be resolved before normalization work can proceed.\n\n---\n\n## Loop Self-Checklist\n\n✅ **Module/layer check:** Evidence-only loop (no code changes); documentation updates only\n✅ **Spec sections quoted:** plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md:127 (H5c task); specs/spec-a-core.md:70-120 (pix0 tolerance)\n✅ **Backpressure:** Evidence loop; no test execution required per input.md directive\n✅ **Full pytest run:** NOT APPLICABLE (evidence-only loop; test suite verification deferred to implementation loops)\n✅ **New problems documented:** Phase H6 added to docs/fix_plan.md (pix0 discrepancy must be resolved)\n✅ **Evidence pointers:** All artifacts documented with file:line references in parity_summary.md and fix_plan.md\n✅ **Scope:** Single module (evidence/documentation); no code changes, stayed within evidence gate","session_id":"4ffad1ef-7ae5-4a19-a609-0a88630ac89e","total_cost_usd":2.0540626,"usage":{"input_tokens":23235,"cache_creation_input_tokens":123870,"cache_read_input_tokens":3621109,"output_tokens":26810,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":123870}},"modelUsage":{"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022":{"inputTokens":31313,"outputTokens":1578,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0313624,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":23235,"outputTokens":26810,"cacheReadInputTokens":3621109,"cacheCreationInputTokens":123870,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.0227002,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"5871fc90-b4e9-4ba8-af8d-2aea7d5e9a5d"}
