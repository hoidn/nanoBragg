This involves:\n    16→1. Generating a detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the original C code for a specific pixel (the \"Golden Trace\").\n    17→2. Generating an identical log from the PyTorch implementation using `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n    18→3. Comparing these two logs line-by-line to find the first point of divergence.\n    19→\n    20→This methodology is mandatory to avoid guesswork and ensure bugs are found deterministically.\n    21→\n    22→## Debugging Workflow (SOP-4.1)\n    23→\n    24→Follow the specialized PyTorch physics debugging process documented in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (see the Parallel Validation Matrix section):\n    25→\n    26→1. **Identify an On-Peak Pixel:** Run the PyTorch simulation and visually inspect the output image to find the coordinates of a bright pixel on a Bragg peak.\n    27→2. **Generate Golden C Trace:** Add trace printf statements to `nanoBragg.c` around the calculation of interest (e.g., detector geometry, scattering vectors). Recompile with `make -C golden_suite_generator` and run with your test parameters, redirecting stderr to capture the trace log.\n    28→3. **Generate PyTorch Trace:** Create a debug script (e.g., `scripts/debug_beam_pivot_trace.py`) that replicates the exact calculation with matching trace output format.\n    29→4. **Compare Traces:** Use a diff tool (`diff`, `vimdiff`, etc.) to compare the C trace and the PyTorch trace.\n    30→5. **Identify Divergence Point:** Find the first variable where the numerical values differ significantly. This is the location of the bug.\n    31→6. **Isolate and Fix:** Examine the PyTorch code responsible for calculating the divergent variable. Check for common issues:\n    32→   - Unit conversion errors (e.g., meters vs. Angstroms).\n    33→   - Incorrect physical constants.\n    34→   - Mismatched mathematical formulas or conventions.\n    35→7. **Apply Fix and Re-validate:** Apply the fix and re-run the PyTorch trace.

This document will save you 4-8 hours by identifying common issues:\n    91→    - Unit system confusion (Detector uses meters internally, not Angstroms)\n    92→    - MOSFLM convention axis swap and +0.5 pixel offset\n    93→    - Undocumented CUSTOM convention switching\n    94→    - Known C code logging bugs\n    95→    - **Failure to read this checklist will result in DAYS of unnecessary debugging!**\n    96→\n    97→0.  **Configuration Parity is Mandatory:** Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult the [C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md). This document is the single source of truth for all parameter mappings and implicit C-code conventions. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:\n    98→    - Implicit pivot mode logic (e.g., `-twotheta` implies SAMPLE pivot)\n    99→    - Convention-dependent beam center calculations (MOSFLM adds 0.5 pixel adjustment)\n   100→    - Rotation axis defaults (MOSFLM uses Y-axis, XDS uses X-axis for twotheta)\n   101→    - Unit conversions (mm→m, degrees→radians)\n   102→\n   103→0.  **Instrumentation / Tracing Discipline:** Never re-derive physics or duplicate algorithms in trace/debug code. Instrumentation must reuse the production helpers or cached intermediates so traces reflect the exact values the main path computed (see [Architecture Hub](./docs/architecture/README.md#⚠️-trace-instrumentation-rule)). Parallel \"trace-only\" implementations inevitably drift and make parity debugging unreliable.\n   104→\n   105→1.  **Units (canonical in spec/arch):** Use the conversions and detector hybrid exception exactly as defined in `specs/spec-a.md` (Units & Geometry) and summarized in `arch.md` and `docs/architecture/detector.md`.\n   106→\n   107→2.  **Crystallographic Convention (by design):** Compute h,k,l via real‑space dot (see `specs/spec-a.md` Physics for the authoritative statement).\n   108→\n   109→3.  **Differentiability:** Follow `arch.md` Differentiability Guidelines (no `.item()` on grad tensors, avoid `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints, derive via functions/properties) and require `torch.autograd.gradcheck` for parameters.\n   110→\n   111→4.  **Coordinate System & Image Orientation:** This project uses a `(slow, fast)` pixel indexing convention, consistent with `matplotlib.imshow(origin='lower')` and `fabio`.\n   112→    -   **Action:** Ensure all `torch.meshgrid` calls use `indexing=\"ij\"` to produce `(slow, fast)` grids.\n   113→    -   **Verification:** When comparing to external images (like the Golden Suite), always confirm the axis orientation. A 90-degree rotation in the diff image is a classic sign of an axis swap.\n   114→\n   115→5.  **Parallel Trace Debugging is Mandatory:** All debugging of physics discrepancies **MUST** begin with a parallel trace comparison.\n   116→    -   **Action:** Generate a step-by-step log from the instrumented C code and an identical log from the PyTorch script (`scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`). Compare these two files to find the first line where they numerically diverge. **Before comparing, consult the component contract in `docs/architecture/` to verify the expected units of all variables in the trace log.**\n   117→    -   **Reference:** See `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` for the strategy and `docs/debugging/debugging.md` for the detailed workflow.\n   118→    -   **Key Scripts:** The primary script for end-to-end validation is `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py`. It uses helper modules `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` to execute the C code and `scripts/smv_parser.py` to read the output images. For single-pixel, step-by-step debugging, use `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n   119→\n   120→6.  **PyTorch Environment Variable:** All PyTorch code execution **MUST** set the environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to prevent MKL library conflicts.\n   121→    -   **Action:** Either set `os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'TRUE'` in Python before importing torch, or prefix command-line calls with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.\n   122→    -   **Reason:** Prevents \"Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libiomp5.dylib already initialized\" crashes when multiple libraries (PyTorch, NumPy) load MKL runtime.\n   123→    -   **Verification:** All Python scripts and tests that import torch must include this environment variable setting.\n   124→\n   125→7.  **Differentiable Programming Principles:** All PyTorch code **MUST** maintain computational graph connectivity for gradient flow.\n   126→    -   **Action:** Avoid functions that explicitly detach tensors from the computation graph within a differentiable code path.\n   127→    -   **Forbidden:** Using `.item()`, `.numpy()`, or `.detach()` on a tensor that requires a gradient, as this will sever the gradient path.\n   128→    -   **Correct:** Pass tensors directly through the computation pipeline. Use Python-level control flow (like `isinstance`) to handle different input types gracefully, but ensure the core operations are performed on tensors.\n   129→    -   **Known Limitation:** Be aware that some PyTorch functions, like `torch.linspace`, do not propagate gradients to their `start` and `end` arguments. In such cases, a manual, differentiable implementation using basic tensor operations (e.g., `torch.arange`) is required.\n   130→    -   **Verification:** All differentiable parameters must have passing `torch.autograd.gradcheck` tests.\n   131→\n   132→8.  **Preserve C-Code References Until Feature-Complete:** C-code quotes in docstrings serve as a roadmap for unimplemented features. They **MUST NOT** be removed until the corresponding feature is fully implemented, tested, and validated.\n   133→    -   **Action:** When implementing a feature described by a C-code quote, leave the quote in place. Once the feature is complete and all its tests (including integration and gradient tests) are passing, the quote may be updated or removed if it no longer adds value beyond the implemented code.\n   134→    -   **Example:** A docstring for an unimplemented function should retain its C-code reference. A docstring for a partially implemented function (e.g., `phi` rotation is done but `misset` is not) should retain the C-code reference for the unimplemented part, clearly marked as \"Future Work\".\n   135→    -   **Verification:** Before removing any C-code reference, confirm that the functionality it describes is covered by a passing test in the test suite.\n   136→\n   137→9.  **Never Use `.item()` on Differentiable Tensors:** The `.item()` method **MUST NOT** be used on any tensor that needs to remain differentiable.\n   138→    -   **Action:** Pass tensors directly to configuration objects and functions instead of extracting scalar values.\n   139→    -   **Forbidden:** `config = Config(param=tensor.item())` - This permanently severs the computation graph.\n   140→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=tensor)` - Preserves gradient flow.\n   141→    -   **Verification:** Any use of `.item()` must be followed by verification that the tensor is not needed for gradient computation.\n   142→\n   143→9.  **Avoid `torch.linspace` for Gradient-Critical Code:** `torch.linspace` does not preserve gradients from tensor endpoints.\n   144→    -   **Action:** Use manual tensor arithmetic for differentiable range generation: `start + step_size * torch.arange(...)`.\n   145→    -   **Forbidden:** `torch.linspace(start_tensor, end_tensor, steps)` where `start_tensor` or `end_tensor` require gradients.\n   146→    -   **Correct:** `start_tensor + (end_tensor - start_tensor) * torch.arange(steps) / (steps - 1)`.\n   147→    -   **Verification:** Check that generated ranges preserve `requires_grad=True` when input tensors require gradients.\n   148→\n   149→10. **Boundary Enforcement for Type Safety:** Use clean architectural boundaries to handle tensor/scalar conversions.\n   150→    -   **Action:** Core methods assume tensor inputs; type conversions happen at call sites.\n   151→    -   **Forbidden:** `isinstance(param, torch.Tensor)` checks inside core computational methods.\n   152→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=torch.tensor(value))` at boundaries, `def core_method(tensor_param)` in implementation.\n   153→    -   **Verification:** Core methods should not contain type checking logic; all parameters should be tensors with consistent device/dtype.\n   154→\n   155→11. **C-Code Reference Template (MANDATORY FOR ALL PORTED FUNCTIONS):**\n   156→    -   **Action:** When implementing ANY function that ports logic from nanoBragg.c, you MUST:\n   157→        1. FIRST create the function stub with the docstring template below\n   158→        2. THEN fill in the C-code reference BEFORE writing any implementation\n   159→        3. ONLY THEN proceed with the Python implementation\n   160→    -   **Template:**\n   161→        ```python\n   162→        def function_name(self, ...):\n   163→            \"\"\"\n   164→            Brief description of function purpose.\n   165→            \n   166→            C-Code Implementation Reference (from nanoBragg.c, lines XXXX-YYYY):\n   167→            ```c\n   168→            [PASTE EXACT C-CODE HERE - DO NOT PARAPHRASE]\n   169→            ```\n   170→            \n   171→            Args:\n   172→                ...\n   173→            Returns:\n   174→                ...\n   175→            \"\"\"\n   176→            # Implementation goes here\n   177→        ```\n   178→    -   **Forbidden:** Writing the implementation before adding the C-code reference\n   179→    -   **Verification:** Before marking any implementation task complete, verify C-code reference exists\n   180→    -   **Rationale:** This is not just for human readability; it is a critical part of our trace-driven validation strategy. It provides a direct, in-code link between the new implementation and its ground-truth reference, which is essential for debugging and verification. Failure to include this reference is considered an implementation error.\n   181→\n   182→12. **Critical Data Flow Convention: The Misset Rotation Pipeline**\n   183→\n   184→    **This rule is non-negotiable and describes a non-standard data flow that MUST be replicated exactly.** The static misset orientation is integrated into the lattice vector calculation in a specific sequence.\n   185→\n   186→    The correct, end-to-end data flow is:\n   187→    1.  Calculate the **base** real (`a,b,c`) and reciprocal (`a*,b*,c*`) vectors from the six unit cell parameters in a canonical orientation.\n   188→    2.  Apply the static misset rotation matrix to **only the reciprocal vectors** (`a*,b*,c*`).\n   189→    3.  **Crucially, recalculate the real-space vectors (`a,b,c`) from the newly rotated reciprocal vectors** using the standard crystallographic relationship (e.g., `a = (b* x c*) * V`).\n   190→    4.  These recalculated, misset-aware real-space vectors are then passed to the dynamic rotation pipeline (`get_rotated_real_vectors`) and are ultimately used in the simulator's Miller index calculation (`h = S·a`).\n   191→\n   192→    **Rationale:** This specific sequence is how `nanoBragg.c` ensures the static orientation is correctly propagated. Any deviation will cause the simulation to fail validation against the golden test cases.\n   193→\n   194→13. **Reciprocal Vector Recalculation for Self-Consistency**\n   195→\n   196→    **The C-code performs a circular recalculation that MUST be replicated for exact metric duality.** After building initial reciprocal vectors and calculating real vectors from them, the C-code recalculates the reciprocal vectors using the standard formula.\n   197→\n   198→    The complete sequence is:\n   199→    1. Build initial reciprocal vectors using the default orientation convention\n   200→    2. Calculate real vectors from reciprocal: `a = (b* × c*) × V`\n   201→    3. **Recalculate reciprocal vectors from real**: `a* = (b × c) / V_actual`\n   202→    4. **Use actual volume**: `V_actual = a · (b × c)` instead of the formula volume\n   203→\n   204→    **Critical:** The volume from the actual vectors differs slightly (~0.6% for triclinic cells) from the formula volume. Using V_actual ensures perfect metric duality (a·a* = 1 exactly).\n   205→\n   206→    **Verification:** The `test_metric_duality` test must pass with `rtol=1e-12`.\n   207→\n   208→14. **Mandatory Component Contracts:** For any non-trivial component port (e.g., `Detector`, `Crystal`), the first step of the implementation phase **MUST** be to author (or consult, if it exists) a complete technical specification in `docs/architecture/[component_name].md`. This contract is the authoritative source for all conventions, units, and logic flows. Implementation must not begin until this document is complete.\n   209→\n   210→15. **Detector Geometry Conventions:** The Detector component follows specific conventions that **MUST** be preserved:\n   211→    -   **Coordinate System:** Lab frame with beam along +X axis, right-handed system, sample at origin\n   212→    -   **Pixel Indexing:** `(slow, fast)` order using `torch.meshgrid(..., indexing=\"ij\")`\n   213→    -   **Pixel Reference:** Integer indices refer to pixel **leading edge/corner**, not center\n   214→    -   **Rotation Order:** detector_rotx → detector_roty → detector_rotz → detector_twotheta\n   215→    -   **Convention Dependency:** MOSFLM vs XDS affects initial basis vectors and twotheta axis\n   216→    -   **Unit Handling:** User config in mm/degrees, internal calculations in Angstroms/radians\n   217→    -   **Pivot Modes:** BEAM pivot (around beam spot) vs SAMPLE pivot (around sample position)\n   218→    -   **Verification:** All detector tests must pass, including basis vector orthonormality and gradient flow\n   219→\n   220→16. **PyTorch Device & Dtype Neutrality:** Implementation MUST work for CPU and GPU tensors and for all supported dtypes without silent device transfers.\n   221→    -   **Action:** Accept tensors on whatever device/dtype the caller provides; use helper utilities (`to()`/`type_as()`) to coerce internal temporaries to the dominant device/dtype instead of hard-coding `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` or allocating new CPU tensors mid-pipeline.\n   222→    -   **Verification:** Add (or update) smoke tests that exercise both CPU and CUDA execution whenever a code path touches tensor math; at minimum, run the authoritative command once with `device=cpu` and once with `device=cuda` (when available) before marking work complete. Treat any Dynamo/compile warnings about mixed devices as failures to resolve immediately.\n   223→    -   **Forbidden:** Leaving datasets, constants, or configuration tensors on default CPU while multiplying by GPU intermediates; relying on implicit device promotion; assuming float64/CPU execution in production paths.\n   224→    -   **Scope:** This applies across the project and to any future PyTorch work you undertake—make code device/dtype agnostic by default.\n   225→\n   226→17. **Tooling & Benchmark Placement:** Benchmark, profiling, and diagnostic scripts SHALL live under structured tooling directories (`scripts/benchmarks/`, `scripts/profiling/`, etc.) and follow the repo’s CLI/env conventions.\n   227→    -   **Action:** When creating or modifying benchmarking utilities, place them under `scripts/…`, require `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, resolve binaries via the documented precedence, and record authoritative commands in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or the relevant tooling index).\n   228→    -   **Forbidden:** Dropping standalone benchmarking files in the repo root or bypassing the editable-install expectation with ad-hoc `sys.path` tweaks.\n   229→    -   **Verification:** Update `docs/fix_plan.md` (Suite/Tooling section) with reproduction commands and results every time a benchmark uncovers an issue; ensure CI/docs reference the canonical script location.\n   230→\n   231→## Crystallographic Conventions\n   232→\n   233→This project adheres to the `|G| = 1/d` convention, where `G = h*a* + k*b* + l*c*`. This is equivalent to the `|Q| = 2π/d` convention where `Q = 2πG`. All tests and calculations must be consistent with this standard.\n   234→\n   235→**Default Orientation Matrix**: The project uses the nanoBragg.c convention for constructing the default orientation of reciprocal lattice vectors from cell parameters:\n   236→- a* is placed purely along the x-axis\n   237→- b* is placed in the x-y plane  \n   238→- c* fills out 3D space\n   239→\n   240→This specific orientation must be maintained for consistency with the C-code implementation.\n   241→\n   242→## Golden Test Case Specification (`simple_cubic`)\n   243→\n   244→**The exact `nanoBragg.c` commands used to generate all golden reference data are centrally documented in `tests/golden_data/README.md`.

Introduction & Philosophy\n     8→\n     9→This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.\n    10→Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:\n    11→\n    12→1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the \"ground truth\" specification.\n    13→2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.\n    14→3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.\n    15→\n    16→All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.\n    17→\n    18→### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline\n    19→\n    20→- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.\n    21→- **Authoritative smoke runs:** When a change touches tensor math, run the authoritative reproduction command once on CPU and once on CUDA (when available). Capture both logs/metrics and attach them to the fix plan. Treat any `torch.compile` or Dynamo warning about mixed devices as blocking.\n    22→- **Targeted tests:** Prefer parametrised tests that iterate over `device in {\"cpu\", \"cuda\"}` (guarded by `torch.cuda.is_available()`). At minimum, ensure a `gpu_smoke` marker or equivalent pytest node exercises the new logic on CUDA before declaring success.\n    23→- **Helper utilities:** Encapsulate device/dtype harmonisation in small helpers (e.g., `tensor.to(other_tensor)` or `type_as`). Centralise these helpers in reusable modules to keep the rule enforceable across future PyTorch projects.\n    24→- **CI gate:** If CI offers GPU runners, add a fast smoke job that runs the `gpu_smoke` marker (or agreed command) so regressions like CPU↔GPU tensor mixing fail quickly.\n    25→- **Vectorization check:** Confirm `_compute_physics_for_position` and related helpers remain batched across sources/phi/mosaic/oversample; extend broadcast dimensions instead of adding Python loops.\n    26→- **Runtime checklist:** Consult `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` during development and cite it in fix-plan notes for PyTorch changes.\n    27→\n    28→### 1.5 Loop Execution Notes (Do Now + Validation Scripts)\n    29→\n    30→- Do Now must include an exact pytest command: In the supervisor→engineer handoff (`input.md`), include the precise `pytest` node(s) that reproduce the active item. If no test exists, first author the minimal targeted test and then run it.\n    31→- Prefer reusable validation scripts: Place ad‑hoc validations under `scripts/validation/` and reference them from `input.md` rather than embedding Python snippets inline. Keep them portable and invoke via the project’s standard CLI/env.\n    32→- Test cadence per loop: Run targeted tests first; execute the full `pytest` suite at most once per engineer turn (end of loop) when code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, use `pytest --collect-only -q` to verify import/collection.\n    33→\n    34→## 2. Configuration Parity\n    35→\n    36→**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before implementing any test that compares against C-code output, you **MUST** ensure exact configuration parity. All golden test cases must be generated with commands that are verifiably equivalent to the PyTorch test configurations.\n    37→\n    38→**Authoritative Reference:** See the **[C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./c_to_pytorch_config_map.md)** for:\n    39→- Complete parameter mappings\n    40→- Implicit conventions (pivot modes, beam adjustments, rotation axes)\n    41→- Common configuration bugs and prevention strategies\n    42→\n    43→Configuration mismatches are the most common source of test failures. Always verify:\n    44→- Pivot mode (BEAM vs SAMPLE) based on parameter implications\n    45→- Convention-specific adjustments (e.g., MOSFLM's 0.5 pixel offset)\n    46→- Default rotation axes for each convention\n    47→- Proper unit conversions at boundaries\n    48→ - Explicit convention selection: tests and harnesses MUST pass `-convention` (or equivalent API flag) to avoid implicit CUSTOM switching when vector parameters are present\n    49→\n    50→\n    51→## 2.1 Ground Truth: Parallel Trace-Driven Validation\n    52→\n    53→The foundation of our testing strategy is a \"Golden Suite\" of test data. Crucially, final-output comparison is insufficient for effective debugging. Our strategy is therefore centered on **Parallel Trace-Driven Validation**.\n    54→\n    55→For each test case, the Golden Suite must contain three components:\n    56→1. **Golden Output Image:** The final .bin file from the C code.\n    57→2. **Golden C-Code Trace Log:** A detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the C code for a specific on-peak pixel.\n    58→3. **PyTorch Trace Log:** An identical, step-by-step log from the PyTorch implementation for the same pixel.\n    59→\n    60→This allows for direct, line-by-line comparison of the entire physics calculation, making it possible to pinpoint the exact line of code where a divergence occurs.\n    61→### 2.2 Instrumenting the C Code\n    62→\n    63→The `nanoBragg.c` source in `golden_suite_generator/` must be instrumented with a `-dump_pixel <slow> <fast>` command-line flag. When run with this flag, the program must write a detailed log file (`<test_case_name>_C_trace.log`) containing key intermediate variables (e.g., `scattering_vector`, `h`, `k`, `l`, `F_cell`, `F_latt`, `omega_pixel`, `polar`) for the specified pixel. This provides the ground truth for component-level testing.\n    64→\n    65→### 2.3 Golden Test Cases\n    66→\n    67→The following test cases will be defined, and all three artifacts (image, C trace, PyTorch trace) will be generated and stored in `tests/golden_data/`.\n    68→\n    69→| Test Case Name | Description | Purpose |\n    70→| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    71→| `simple_cubic` | A 100Å cubic cell, single wavelength, no mosaicity, no oscillation. | The \"hello world\" test for basic geometry and spot calculation. |\n    72→| `triclinic_P1` | A low-symmetry triclinic cell with misset orientation. | To stress-test the reciprocal space and geometry calculations. |\n    73→| `simple_cubic_mosaic` | The `simple_cubic` case with mosaic spread. | To test the mosaic domain implementation. |\n    74→| `cubic_tilted_detector` | Cubic cell with rotated and tilted detector. | To test general detector geometry implementation. |\n    75→\n    76→### 2.4 Canonical Generation Commands\n    77→\n    78→**⚠️ CRITICAL:** The following commands are the **single source of truth** for reproducing the golden data.

Tooling & Benchmark Hygiene\n   463→\n   464→- **Directory layout:** Place benchmarks, profilers, and ad-hoc tooling under `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py`). Do not add standalone executables to the repo root.\n   465→- **Environment parity:** All tooling must honour the same environment contract as the tests (`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, `NB_C_BIN` precedence, editable install). Scripts SHOULD exit with a non-zero status if prerequisites are missing.\n   466→- **Plan integration:** When a benchmark exposes a regression, log the command, metrics, and artifact path under `docs/fix_plan.md` › `## Suite Failures` or the relevant tracking section.\n   467→- **Generalisation:** These expectations apply to any PyTorch project you touch—structure tooling predictably, rely on documented env vars, and keep benchmark commands discoverable through project docs.\n   468→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious.

Update `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` §VG-1 with dual-mode thresholds\n2. Update `docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md` to reference this analysis\n3. Ensure `tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py` documents the relaxed tolerance for c-parity\n4. Proceed to Phase C5 (summary & log attempt in `docs/fix_plan.md`)\n\n## Artifacts\n\nAll artifacts stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/`:\n- `trace_py_c_parity_float32.log` / `trace_py_c_parity_float64.log` / `trace_py_spec_float32.log`\n- `env_*.json` / `config_*.json` — environment and configuration snapshots\n- Per-φ traces: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/per_phi/reports/.../20251201_dtype_probe/*_per_phi.json`\n- `delta_metrics.json` — structured summary for downstream automation\n- `commands.txt` — exact reproduction commands\n- `sha256.txt` — checksums for all artifacts\n\n## Next Actions (Phase C5)\n\n1. Update diagnosis.md with VG-1 dual-mode thresholds\n2. Update verified_c_bugs.md with parity shim availability note\n3. Log this attempt in `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempts History\n4. Mark Phase C4 tasks C4b/C4c/C4d as [D] in plan\n5.
