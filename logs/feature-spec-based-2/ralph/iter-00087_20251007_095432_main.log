Introduction & Philosophy\n     8→\n     9→This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of nanoBragg. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a correct, verifiable, and trustworthy scientific tool.\n    10→Our testing philosophy is a three-tiered hybrid approach, designed to build confidence layer by layer:\n    11→\n    12→1. **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the \"ground truth\" specification.\n    13→2. **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound.\n    14→3. **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles.\n    15→\n    16→All tests will be implemented using the PyTest framework.\n    17→\n    18→### 1.4 PyTorch Device & Dtype Discipline\n    19→\n    20→- **Device-neutral code:** Every PyTorch path MUST operate correctly on both CPU and CUDA tensors and across supported dtypes. Do not hard-code `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` calls, create CPU-only constants, or assume float64 execution when the caller may supply float32/half tensors.\n    21→- **Authoritative smoke runs:** When a change touches tensor math, run the authoritative reproduction command once on CPU and once on CUDA (when available). Capture both logs/metrics and attach them to the fix plan. Treat any `torch.compile` or Dynamo warning about mixed devices as blocking.\n    22→- **Targeted tests:** Prefer parametrised tests that iterate over `device in {\"cpu\", \"cuda\"}` (guarded by `torch.cuda.is_available()`). At minimum, ensure a `gpu_smoke` marker or equivalent pytest node exercises the new logic on CUDA before declaring success.\n    23→- **Helper utilities:** Encapsulate device/dtype harmonisation in small helpers (e.g., `tensor.to(other_tensor)` or `type_as`). Centralise these helpers in reusable modules to keep the rule enforceable across future PyTorch projects.\n    24→- **CI gate:** If CI offers GPU runners, add a fast smoke job that runs the `gpu_smoke` marker (or agreed command) so regressions like CPU↔GPU tensor mixing fail quickly.\n    25→- **Vectorization check:** Confirm `_compute_physics_for_position` and related helpers remain batched across sources/phi/mosaic/oversample; extend broadcast dimensions instead of adding Python loops.\n    26→- **Runtime checklist:** Consult `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` during development and cite it in fix-plan notes for PyTorch changes.\n    27→\n    28→### 1.5 Loop Execution Notes (Do Now + Validation Scripts)\n    29→\n    30→- Do Now must include an exact pytest command: In the supervisor→engineer handoff (`input.md`), include the precise `pytest` node(s) that reproduce the active item. If no test exists, first author the minimal targeted test and then run it.\n    31→- Prefer reusable validation scripts: Place ad‑hoc validations under `scripts/validation/` and reference them from `input.md` rather than embedding Python snippets inline. Keep them portable and invoke via the project’s standard CLI/env.\n    32→- Test cadence per loop: Run targeted tests first; execute the full `pytest` suite at most once per engineer turn (end of loop) when code changed. For prompt/docs‑only loops, use `pytest --collect-only -q` to verify import/collection.\n    33→\n    34→## 2. Configuration Parity\n    35→\n    36→**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before implementing any test that compares against C-code output, you **MUST** ensure exact configuration parity. All golden test cases must be generated with commands that are verifiably equivalent to the PyTorch test configurations.\n    37→\n    38→**Authoritative Reference:** See the **[C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./c_to_pytorch_config_map.md)** for:\n    39→- Complete parameter mappings\n    40→- Implicit conventions (pivot modes, beam adjustments, rotation axes)\n    41→- Common configuration bugs and prevention strategies\n    42→\n    43→Configuration mismatches are the most common source of test failures. Always verify:\n    44→- Pivot mode (BEAM vs SAMPLE) based on parameter implications\n    45→- Convention-specific adjustments (e.g., MOSFLM's 0.5 pixel offset)\n    46→- Default rotation axes for each convention\n    47→- Proper unit conversions at boundaries\n    48→ - Explicit convention selection: tests and harnesses MUST pass `-convention` (or equivalent API flag) to avoid implicit CUSTOM switching when vector parameters are present\n    49→\n    50→\n    51→## 2.1 Ground Truth: Parallel Trace-Driven Validation\n    52→\n    53→The foundation of our testing strategy is a \"Golden Suite\" of test data. Crucially, final-output comparison is insufficient for effective debugging. Our strategy is therefore centered on **Parallel Trace-Driven Validation**.\n    54→\n    55→For each test case, the Golden Suite must contain three components:\n    56→1. **Golden Output Image:** The final .bin file from the C code.\n    57→2. **Golden C-Code Trace Log:** A detailed, step-by-step log of intermediate variables from the C code for a specific on-peak pixel.\n    58→3. **PyTorch Trace Log:** An identical, step-by-step log from the PyTorch implementation for the same pixel.\n    59→\n    60→This allows for direct, line-by-line comparison of the entire physics calculation, making it possible to pinpoint the exact line of code where a divergence occurs.\n    61→### 2.2 Instrumenting the C Code\n    62→\n    63→The `nanoBragg.c` source in `golden_suite_generator/` must be instrumented with a `-dump_pixel <slow> <fast>` command-line flag. When run with this flag, the program must write a detailed log file (`<test_case_name>_C_trace.log`) containing key intermediate variables (e.g., `scattering_vector`, `h`, `k`, `l`, `F_cell`, `F_latt`, `omega_pixel`, `polar`) for the specified pixel.

This test should only be expected to pass after the Parallel Trace Comparison test passes.\n   375→\n   376→**Primary Validation Tool:** The main script for running end-to-end parallel validation against the C-code reference is `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py`. This script automates the execution of both the PyTorch and C implementations, generates comparison plots, and computes quantitative correlation metrics. It relies on `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` to manage the C-code execution.\n   377→\n   378→## 4.

Tooling & Benchmark Hygiene\n   463→\n   464→- **Directory layout:** Place benchmarks, profilers, and ad-hoc tooling under `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py`). Do not add standalone executables to the repo root.\n   465→- **Environment parity:** All tooling must honour the same environment contract as the tests (`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, `NB_C_BIN` precedence, editable install). Scripts SHOULD exit with a non-zero status if prerequisites are missing.\n   466→- **Plan integration:** When a benchmark exposes a regression, log the command, metrics, and artifact path under `docs/fix_plan.md` › `## Suite Failures` or the relevant tracking section.\n   467→- **Generalisation:** These expectations apply to any PyTorch project you touch—structure tooling predictably, rely on documented env vars, and keep benchmark commands discoverable through project docs.\n   468→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"41050c03-3cd7-4a51-aacc-a90151a036bb","uuid":"e2bf04b9-f6a5-4fc0-a4c3-e7c835e69866"}

This document will save you 4-8 hours by identifying common issues:\n    91→    - Unit system confusion (Detector uses meters internally, not Angstroms)\n    92→    - MOSFLM convention axis swap and +0.5 pixel offset\n    93→    - Undocumented CUSTOM convention switching\n    94→    - Known C code logging bugs\n    95→    - **Failure to read this checklist will result in DAYS of unnecessary debugging!**\n    96→\n    97→0.  **Configuration Parity is Mandatory:** Before writing any test or implementation that involves C-code validation, you **MUST** consult the [C-CLI to PyTorch Configuration Map](./docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md). This document is the single source of truth for all parameter mappings and implicit C-code conventions. Failure to ensure 1:1 configuration parity is the most common source of bugs, particularly with:\n    98→    - Implicit pivot mode logic (e.g., `-twotheta` implies SAMPLE pivot)\n    99→    - Convention-dependent beam center calculations (MOSFLM adds 0.5 pixel adjustment)\n   100→    - Rotation axis defaults (MOSFLM uses Y-axis, XDS uses X-axis for twotheta)\n   101→    - Unit conversions (mm→m, degrees→radians)\n   102→\n   103→0.  **Instrumentation / Tracing Discipline:** Never re-derive physics or duplicate algorithms in trace/debug code. Instrumentation must reuse the production helpers or cached intermediates so traces reflect the exact values the main path computed (see [Architecture Hub](./docs/architecture/README.md#⚠️-trace-instrumentation-rule)). Parallel \"trace-only\" implementations inevitably drift and make parity debugging unreliable.\n   104→\n   105→1.  **Units (canonical in spec/arch):** Use the conversions and detector hybrid exception exactly as defined in `specs/spec-a.md` (Units & Geometry) and summarized in `arch.md` and `docs/architecture/detector.md`.\n   106→\n   107→2.  **Crystallographic Convention (by design):** Compute h,k,l via real‑space dot (see `specs/spec-a.md` Physics for the authoritative statement).\n   108→\n   109→3.  **Differentiability:** Follow `arch.md` Differentiability Guidelines (no `.item()` on grad tensors, avoid `torch.linspace` with tensor endpoints, derive via functions/properties) and require `torch.autograd.gradcheck` for parameters.\n   110→\n   111→4.  **Coordinate System & Image Orientation:** This project uses a `(slow, fast)` pixel indexing convention, consistent with `matplotlib.imshow(origin='lower')` and `fabio`.\n   112→    -   **Action:** Ensure all `torch.meshgrid` calls use `indexing=\"ij\"` to produce `(slow, fast)` grids.\n   113→    -   **Verification:** When comparing to external images (like the Golden Suite), always confirm the axis orientation. A 90-degree rotation in the diff image is a classic sign of an axis swap.\n   114→\n   115→5.  **Parallel Trace Debugging is Mandatory:** All debugging of physics discrepancies **MUST** begin with a parallel trace comparison.\n   116→    -   **Action:** Generate a step-by-step log from the instrumented C code and an identical log from the PyTorch script (`scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`). Compare these two files to find the first line where they numerically diverge. **Before comparing, consult the component contract in `docs/architecture/` to verify the expected units of all variables in the trace log.**\n   117→    -   **Reference:** See `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` for the strategy and `docs/debugging/debugging.md` for the detailed workflow.\n   118→    -   **Key Scripts:** The primary script for end-to-end validation is `scripts/verify_detector_geometry.py`. It uses helper modules `scripts/c_reference_runner.py` to execute the C code and `scripts/smv_parser.py` to read the output images. For single-pixel, step-by-step debugging, use `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py`.\n   119→\n   120→6.  **PyTorch Environment Variable:** All PyTorch code execution **MUST** set the environment variable `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` to prevent MKL library conflicts.\n   121→    -   **Action:** Either set `os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'TRUE'` in Python before importing torch, or prefix command-line calls with `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`.\n   122→    -   **Reason:** Prevents \"Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libiomp5.dylib already initialized\" crashes when multiple libraries (PyTorch, NumPy) load MKL runtime.\n   123→    -   **Verification:** All Python scripts and tests that import torch must include this environment variable setting.\n   124→\n   125→7.  **Differentiable Programming Principles:** All PyTorch code **MUST** maintain computational graph connectivity for gradient flow.\n   126→    -   **Action:** Avoid functions that explicitly detach tensors from the computation graph within a differentiable code path.\n   127→    -   **Forbidden:** Using `.item()`, `.numpy()`, or `.detach()` on a tensor that requires a gradient, as this will sever the gradient path.\n   128→    -   **Correct:** Pass tensors directly through the computation pipeline. Use Python-level control flow (like `isinstance`) to handle different input types gracefully, but ensure the core operations are performed on tensors.\n   129→    -   **Known Limitation:** Be aware that some PyTorch functions, like `torch.linspace`, do not propagate gradients to their `start` and `end` arguments. In such cases, a manual, differentiable implementation using basic tensor operations (e.g., `torch.arange`) is required.\n   130→    -   **Verification:** All differentiable parameters must have passing `torch.autograd.gradcheck` tests.\n   131→\n   132→8.  **Preserve C-Code References Until Feature-Complete:** C-code quotes in docstrings serve as a roadmap for unimplemented features. They **MUST NOT** be removed until the corresponding feature is fully implemented, tested, and validated.\n   133→    -   **Action:** When implementing a feature described by a C-code quote, leave the quote in place. Once the feature is complete and all its tests (including integration and gradient tests) are passing, the quote may be updated or removed if it no longer adds value beyond the implemented code.\n   134→    -   **Example:** A docstring for an unimplemented function should retain its C-code reference. A docstring for a partially implemented function (e.g., `phi` rotation is done but `misset` is not) should retain the C-code reference for the unimplemented part, clearly marked as \"Future Work\".\n   135→    -   **Verification:** Before removing any C-code reference, confirm that the functionality it describes is covered by a passing test in the test suite.\n   136→\n   137→9.  **Never Use `.item()` on Differentiable Tensors:** The `.item()` method **MUST NOT** be used on any tensor that needs to remain differentiable.\n   138→    -   **Action:** Pass tensors directly to configuration objects and functions instead of extracting scalar values.\n   139→    -   **Forbidden:** `config = Config(param=tensor.item())` - This permanently severs the computation graph.\n   140→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=tensor)` - Preserves gradient flow.\n   141→    -   **Verification:** Any use of `.item()` must be followed by verification that the tensor is not needed for gradient computation.\n   142→\n   143→9.  **Avoid `torch.linspace` for Gradient-Critical Code:** `torch.linspace` does not preserve gradients from tensor endpoints.\n   144→    -   **Action:** Use manual tensor arithmetic for differentiable range generation: `start + step_size * torch.arange(...)`.\n   145→    -   **Forbidden:** `torch.linspace(start_tensor, end_tensor, steps)` where `start_tensor` or `end_tensor` require gradients.\n   146→    -   **Correct:** `start_tensor + (end_tensor - start_tensor) * torch.arange(steps) / (steps - 1)`.\n   147→    -   **Verification:** Check that generated ranges preserve `requires_grad=True` when input tensors require gradients.\n   148→\n   149→10. **Boundary Enforcement for Type Safety:** Use clean architectural boundaries to handle tensor/scalar conversions.\n   150→    -   **Action:** Core methods assume tensor inputs; type conversions happen at call sites.\n   151→    -   **Forbidden:** `isinstance(param, torch.Tensor)` checks inside core computational methods.\n   152→    -   **Correct:** `config = Config(param=torch.tensor(value))` at boundaries, `def core_method(tensor_param)` in implementation.\n   153→    -   **Verification:** Core methods should not contain type checking logic; all parameters should be tensors with consistent device/dtype.\n   154→\n   155→11. **C-Code Reference Template (MANDATORY FOR ALL PORTED FUNCTIONS):**\n   156→    -   **Action:** When implementing ANY function that ports logic from nanoBragg.c, you MUST:\n   157→        1. FIRST create the function stub with the docstring template below\n   158→        2. THEN fill in the C-code reference BEFORE writing any implementation\n   159→        3. ONLY THEN proceed with the Python implementation\n   160→    -   **Template:**\n   161→        ```python\n   162→        def function_name(self, ...):\n   163→            \"\"\"\n   164→            Brief description of function purpose.\n   165→            \n   166→            C-Code Implementation Reference (from nanoBragg.c, lines XXXX-YYYY):\n   167→            ```c\n   168→            [PASTE EXACT C-CODE HERE - DO NOT PARAPHRASE]\n   169→            ```\n   170→            \n   171→            Args:\n   172→                ...\n   173→            Returns:\n   174→                ...\n   175→            \"\"\"\n   176→            # Implementation goes here\n   177→        ```\n   178→    -   **Forbidden:** Writing the implementation before adding the C-code reference\n   179→    -   **Verification:** Before marking any implementation task complete, verify C-code reference exists\n   180→    -   **Rationale:** This is not just for human readability; it is a critical part of our trace-driven validation strategy. It provides a direct, in-code link between the new implementation and its ground-truth reference, which is essential for debugging and verification. Failure to include this reference is considered an implementation error.\n   181→\n   182→12. **Critical Data Flow Convention: The Misset Rotation Pipeline**\n   183→\n   184→    **This rule is non-negotiable and describes a non-standard data flow that MUST be replicated exactly.** The static misset orientation is integrated into the lattice vector calculation in a specific sequence.\n   185→\n   186→    The correct, end-to-end data flow is:\n   187→    1.  Calculate the **base** real (`a,b,c`) and reciprocal (`a*,b*,c*`) vectors from the six unit cell parameters in a canonical orientation.\n   188→    2.  Apply the static misset rotation matrix to **only the reciprocal vectors** (`a*,b*,c*`).\n   189→    3.  **Crucially, recalculate the real-space vectors (`a,b,c`) from the newly rotated reciprocal vectors** using the standard crystallographic relationship (e.g., `a = (b* x c*) * V`).\n   190→    4.  These recalculated, misset-aware real-space vectors are then passed to the dynamic rotation pipeline (`get_rotated_real_vectors`) and are ultimately used in the simulator's Miller index calculation (`h = S·a`).\n   191→\n   192→    **Rationale:** This specific sequence is how `nanoBragg.c` ensures the static orientation is correctly propagated. Any deviation will cause the simulation to fail validation against the golden test cases.\n   193→\n   194→13. **Reciprocal Vector Recalculation for Self-Consistency**\n   195→\n   196→    **The C-code performs a circular recalculation that MUST be replicated for exact metric duality.** After building initial reciprocal vectors and calculating real vectors from them, the C-code recalculates the reciprocal vectors using the standard formula.\n   197→\n   198→    The complete sequence is:\n   199→    1. Build initial reciprocal vectors using the default orientation convention\n   200→    2. Calculate real vectors from reciprocal: `a = (b* × c*) × V`\n   201→    3. **Recalculate reciprocal vectors from real**: `a* = (b × c) / V_actual`\n   202→    4. **Use actual volume**: `V_actual = a · (b × c)` instead of the formula volume\n   203→\n   204→    **Critical:** The volume from the actual vectors differs slightly (~0.6% for triclinic cells) from the formula volume. Using V_actual ensures perfect metric duality (a·a* = 1 exactly).\n   205→\n   206→    **Verification:** The `test_metric_duality` test must pass with `rtol=1e-12`.\n   207→\n   208→14. **Mandatory Component Contracts:** For any non-trivial component port (e.g., `Detector`, `Crystal`), the first step of the implementation phase **MUST** be to author (or consult, if it exists) a complete technical specification in `docs/architecture/[component_name].md`. This contract is the authoritative source for all conventions, units, and logic flows. Implementation must not begin until this document is complete.\n   209→\n   210→15. **Detector Geometry Conventions:** The Detector component follows specific conventions that **MUST** be preserved:\n   211→    -   **Coordinate System:** Lab frame with beam along +X axis, right-handed system, sample at origin\n   212→    -   **Pixel Indexing:** `(slow, fast)` order using `torch.meshgrid(..., indexing=\"ij\")`\n   213→    -   **Pixel Reference:** Integer indices refer to pixel **leading edge/corner**, not center\n   214→    -   **Rotation Order:** detector_rotx → detector_roty → detector_rotz → detector_twotheta\n   215→    -   **Convention Dependency:** MOSFLM vs XDS affects initial basis vectors and twotheta axis\n   216→    -   **Unit Handling:** User config in mm/degrees, internal calculations in Angstroms/radians\n   217→    -   **Pivot Modes:** BEAM pivot (around beam spot) vs SAMPLE pivot (around sample position)\n   218→    -   **Verification:** All detector tests must pass, including basis vector orthonormality and gradient flow\n   219→\n   220→16. **PyTorch Device & Dtype Neutrality:** Implementation MUST work for CPU and GPU tensors and for all supported dtypes without silent device transfers.\n   221→    -   **Action:** Accept tensors on whatever device/dtype the caller provides; use helper utilities (`to()`/`type_as()`) to coerce internal temporaries to the dominant device/dtype instead of hard-coding `.cpu()`/`.cuda()` or allocating new CPU tensors mid-pipeline.\n   222→    -   **Verification:** Add (or update) smoke tests that exercise both CPU and CUDA execution whenever a code path touches tensor math; at minimum, run the authoritative command once with `device=cpu` and once with `device=cuda` (when available) before marking work complete. Treat any Dynamo/compile warnings about mixed devices as failures to resolve immediately.\n   223→    -   **Forbidden:** Leaving datasets, constants, or configuration tensors on default CPU while multiplying by GPU intermediates; relying on implicit device promotion; assuming float64/CPU execution in production paths.\n   224→    -   **Scope:** This applies across the project and to any future PyTorch work you undertake—make code device/dtype agnostic by default.\n   225→\n   226→17. **Tooling & Benchmark Placement:** Benchmark, profiling, and diagnostic scripts SHALL live under structured tooling directories (`scripts/benchmarks/`, `scripts/profiling/`, etc.) and follow the repo’s CLI/env conventions.\n   227→    -   **Action:** When creating or modifying benchmarking utilities, place them under `scripts/…`, require `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`, resolve binaries via the documented precedence, and record authoritative commands in `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (or the relevant tooling index).\n   228→    -   **Forbidden:** Dropping standalone benchmarking files in the repo root or bypassing the editable-install expectation with ad-hoc `sys.path` tweaks.\n   229→    -   **Verification:** Update `docs/fix_plan.md` (Suite/Tooling section) with reproduction commands and results every time a benchmark uncovers an issue; ensure CI/docs reference the canonical script location.\n   230→\n   231→## Crystallographic Conventions\n   232→\n   233→This project adheres to the `|G| = 1/d` convention, where `G = h*a* + k*b* + l*c*`. This is equivalent to the `|Q| = 2π/d` convention where `Q = 2πG`. All tests and calculations must be consistent with this standard.\n   234→\n   235→**Default Orientation Matrix**: The project uses the nanoBragg.c convention for constructing the default orientation of reciprocal lattice vectors from cell parameters:\n   236→- a* is placed purely along the x-axis\n   237→- b* is placed in the x-y plane  \n   238→- c* fills out 3D space\n   239→\n   240→This specific orientation must be maintained for consistency with the C-code implementation.\n   241→\n   242→## Golden Test Case Specification (`simple_cubic`)\n   243→\n   244→**The exact `nanoBragg.c` commands used to generate all golden reference data are centrally documented in `tests/golden_data/README.md`.

Both paths use `self.incident_beam_direction` (global) instead of per-source `incident_dirs_batched`. Multi-source runs compute incorrect polarization factors. Fix requires either (1) passing `incident_dirs_batched` to polarization in multi-source branch, or (2) moving polarization inside `compute_physics_for_position`.\n   136→    Next Actions: Fix P3.0b by refactoring polarization to use per-source incident directions; recommend approach (1) for minimal disruption.

Re-reviewed post-dtype-default commits (`fcbb93a`, `904dc9b`, `b06a6d6`, `8c2ceb4`) and confirmed Phase 3 blockers remain unresolved despite checklist boxes being marked complete.\n   163→    Metrics: Analysis only.\n   164→    Artifacts: n/a (code review only; see citations below).\n   165→    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) `Simulator.__init__` still calls `.to(...)` on `beam_config.source_wavelengths`/`source_weights` without guarding for `None`, so divergence configs that rely on auto-generated tensors crash immediately (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:427-441`). (2) Multi-source polarization continues to reuse only the first source direction, leaving secondary sources unpolarized and violating AT-SRC-001 (`simulator.py:775-822` and `simulator.py:894-950`). (3) The `steps` normalization still divides by `source_weights.sum()` so intensities average instead of summing (`simulator.py:687-695`). (4) ROI masks and external masks are rebuilt from scratch on every run, causing allocator churn and keeping CPU benchmarks slower than C even after warm caches (`simulator.py:611-629`).\n   166→    Next Actions: Re-open plan tasks P3.0/P3.0b/P3.0c/P3.4 in code, implement guarded seeding + per-source polarization + post-sum weighting before normalization, then hoist ROI/misset tensors ahead of re-running benchmarks. Only after those fixes land should Ralph resume P3.2/P3.3 measurements.\n   167→  * [2025-10-06] Attempt #13 — Result: supervisor audit (galph loop AS). Confirmed that current HEAD still averages multi-source intensities via `steps` (dividing by `source_weights.sum()`/`n_sources`) and applies polarization using only the primary source (`incident_dirs_batched[0]`) in both oversample and pixel-center paths (`src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:714-779, 879-944`). ROI mask reconstruction (`simulator.py:626-642`) and repeated `.to()` conversions on cached detector grids persist, so allocator churn remains a CPU bottleneck. No benchmarks or traces executed this loop.\n   168→    Metrics: Analysis only.\n   169→    Artifacts: None — findings recorded in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (Phase 3 notes) and galph_memory.md (2025-10-06 loop AS entry).\n   170→    Observations/Hypotheses: Physics semantics unchanged since Attempt #12; Ralph must land P3.0b/P3.0c fixes before new performance data is meaningful. ROI/misset caching (P3.4) and source guard rails remain prerequisites to re-running P3.2/P3.3 benchmarks.\n   171→    Next Actions: Same as Attempt #12 — execute plan tasks P3.0b/P3.0c/P3.4 under `prompts/debug.md`, capturing 3-source C/Py traces and refreshed CPU benchmarks once fixes land.\n   172→  * [2025-10-07] Attempt #14 — Result: supervisor audit. Reconciled AT-SRC-001 in `specs/spec-a-core.md` with current simulator behavior; confirmed `steps` must divide by the **count** of sources (not the sum of weights) and that ROI mask regeneration at `simulator.py:611-705` remains a CPU bottleneck. Updated `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` Phase 3 table with spec citations, explicit reproduction commands (`pytest tests/test_multi_source_integration.py::test_multi_source_intensity_normalization`, `nb-compare --sourcefile ...`) and profiler artifact expectations.\n   173→    Metrics: Analysis only.\n   174→    Artifacts: plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md (Phase 3 table stamped 2025-10-07), galph_memory.md (loop entry pending at close of supervisor run).\n   175→    Observations/Hypotheses: Current code still violates AT-SRC-001 normalization and per-source polarization; ROI/misset tensors and detector constants are rebuilt each run, explaining persistent allocator churn in CPU benchmarks. These must be corrected before any new performance numbers are credible.\n   176→    Next Actions: Ralph to execute updated plan tasks P3.0–P3.0c (multi-source defaults, per-source polarization, normalization) and P3.4 (ROI/misset caching) with the new artifact targets before rerunning P3.2/P3.3 benchmarks.\n   177→  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #15 — Result: supervisor audit. Re-read `Simulator.run`/`compute_physics_for_position` and confirmed multi-source polarization still collapses to the primary source direction (`incident_dirs_batched[0]`) in both oversample and pixel-center paths; ROI mask allocation and detector grid `.to()` casts re-run every invocation. New `source_norm = n_sources` logic is present but unverified against C weighting.\n   178→    Metrics: Analysis only.\n   179→    Artifacts: None (findings logged in galph_memory.md — 2025-10-08 loop AY entry).\n   180→    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) Polarization should be computed per-source before reduction; current broadcast turns Kahn factors into an average. (2) `roi_mask = torch.ones(...)` (`simulator.py:618-635`) and `detector.get_pixel_coords().to(...)` rebuild large tensors per call, blocking P3.4’s allocator goals. (3) The revised `source_norm = n_sources` path needs validation with a weighted multi-source test to ensure it matches C output. \n   181→    Next Actions: Ralph to execute plan tasks P3.0b (per-source polarization) and P3.0c (normalization validation with weighted sources) with new trace/benchmark artifacts, then deliver P3.4 ROI/misset caching before re-running P3.2/P3.3 benchmarks.\n   182→  * [2025-10-08] Attempt #16 — Result: supervisor audit (galph loop AZ). Reviewed `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:2604-3278` and confirmed the C implementation ignores `source_I` during the accumulation loop (it only seeds `I` before `I = I_bg`). PyTorch’s current weighted reduction therefore diverges from C semantics for non-uniform source weights. Collected evidence by tracing the C loop and cross-checking with `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:300-360`.\n   183→    Metrics: Analysis only.\n   184→    Artifacts: plan update in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (P3.0c guidance refreshed 2025-10-08); galph_memory.md (loop AZ entry pending).\n   185→    Observations/Hypotheses: Need to reconcile weighting semantics—either adopt C’s behavior (ignore weights) or document/validate a new contract. Weighted parity artifacts (nb-compare + pytest) are still outstanding and must drive the decision before benchmarking.\n   186→    Next Actions: Execute updated P3.0c tasks: build two-source weighted comparison, capture C vs PyTorch metrics, and decide on the correct weighting model. Block P3.2/P3.3 benchmarking until this parity evidence exists.\n   187→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #17 — Result: partial (P3.2 complete; P3.3 blocked). Executed fresh CPU benchmarks after P3.0–P3.4 physics fixes completed. CPU results show excellent cache performance (4469-6433× setup speedup) and 256² meeting targets (3.24× faster warm), but 512²/1024² still lag C (0.78× and 0.43× speedup respectively). CUDA benchmarks blocked by `RuntimeError: Error: accessing tensor output of CUDAGraphs that has been overwritten` in polarization reshape views. Attempted `.contiguous()` fix insufficient; requires `.clone()` instead.\n   188→    Metrics: CPU: 256²=3.24× faster (warm), 512²=C 1.28× faster, 1024²=C 2.33× faster; corr≥0.99999 all sizes. CUDA: execution error, benchmarks incomplete.\n   189→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-212505/benchmark_results.json` (CPU only); CUDA artifacts missing due to blocker.\n   190→    Observations/Hypotheses: CPU warm runs improved significantly vs Attempt #9 but still violate ≤1.5× criterion for larger sizes. CUDA graphs incompatible with reshape views even after `.contiguous()`; need explicit `.clone()` at lines 320-321, 344-347, 858 in `simulator.py`. Partial fix applied (`.contiguous()` added) but error persists because CUDA graphs requires full tensor copy, not just memory layout guarantee.\n   191→    Next Actions: (1) Replace `.contiguous()` with `.clone()` in polarization paths and rerun CUDA benchmarks (P3.3). (2) After CUDA data collected, analyze combined CPU+CUDA results and decide P3.5 (proceed to Phase 4 or close out).\n   192→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #18 — Result: partial (P3.2 rerun complete; 1024² CPU still slow). Re-executed CPU benchmarks after P3.0/P3.0b/P3.4 landed; archived summary under `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/cpu/`. Warm runs now show 256² 4.07× faster than C and 512² within tolerance (0.82× slower), but 1024² remains 2.43× slower (0.41× speedup). Cache setup stayed <50 ms (4376–6428× faster). Correlations ≥0.9999999999366 throughout.\n   193→    Metrics: CPU warm timings — 256²: 0.003 s vs C 0.012 s; 512²: 0.025 s vs C 0.020 s; 1024²: 0.099 s vs C 0.041 s.

Need CUDA results plus weighted-source parity before Phase 3 closure. P3.0c remains the gating prerequisite for final benchmarking memo.\n   196→    Next Actions: Run P3.3 CUDA benchmarks once cudagraph blocker is cleared; finish P3.0c weighted-source validation before issuing the Phase 3 decision (P3.5).\n   197→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #19 — Result: partial (P3.3 CUDA benchmarks captured; weighting unresolved). Added `torch.compiler.cudagraph_mark_step_begin()` in `_compute_physics_for_position` wrapper to fix CUDA graphs aliasing, then collected CUDA benchmarks (`reports/benchmarks/20250930-220739/`, `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220755/`). Warm GPU runs now beat C (256² 1.55×, 512² 1.69×, 1024² 3.33× faster) with cache setup ≤18 ms and correlation ≥0.999999999912.

Verified multi-source vectorization now applies Kahn factors per source, but normalization still divides by `n_sources` after applying optional weights. C ignores input weights entirely, so PyTorch currently undercounts unequal-weight cases (average of weights instead of sum). ROI/pixel coordinate caching (`Simulator.__init__`:534-564) confirmed effective; allocator churn persists primarily from per-run ROI `.to()` copies.

Decide whether to proceed to Phase C diagnostics or close plan as target nearly achieved.\n   210→    Observations/Hypotheses: Without parity evidence, the plan closure claim in commit e8742d7 is unsupported; Phase 3 cannot end until unequal-weight cases either match C or a deliberate contract change is documented. CPU 1024² still 2.43× slower, so we lack data to justify deferring Phase 4.\n   211→    Next Actions: Deliver P3.0c artifacts (two-source unequal weights) per plan guidance, fix normalization semantics, then rerun CPU/CUDA benchmarks (P3.2/P3.3) before issuing the Phase 3 memo (P3.5).\n   212→    Observations/Hypotheses: PERF-PYTORCH-005 cudagraph guard clears blocker, but Phase 3 exit still gated by P3.0c weighted-source parity and CPU 1024² slowdown. `BeamConfig.source_weights` docstring still claims weights are ignored—update documentation once parity decision lands. Need nb-compare + pytest artifacts for unequal weights before considering P3.0c closed.\n   213→    Next Actions: Execute P3.0c weighted-source validation (two-source unequal weights, CPU+CUDA, nb-compare + pytest), then revisit CPU 1024² deficit in the Phase 3 memo (P3.5). Update plan table to link new CUDA artifacts once parity evidence is captured.\n   214→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #21 — Result: P3.0c COMPLETE. Validated weighted multi-source normalization on CPU and CUDA with 2 sources (weights 2.0 & 3.0, λ 6.2Å & 8.0Å). PyTorch correctly implements `steps / n_sources` normalization per AT-SRC-001. Discovered C code ignores `source_I` weights during accumulation (line 2616 overwrites weight with `I_bg`), making C↔Py weighted parity impossible. CPU/CUDA self-consistency verified (rel diff <2e-6).\n   215→    Metrics: CPU total=8.914711e-05, CUDA total=8.914727e-05, rel_diff=1.80e-06 (<0.01%).\n   216→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/{P3.0c_summary.md, validation_results.json, weighted_sources.txt, validate_weighted_source_normalization.py}`.\n   217→    Observations/Hypotheses: PyTorch applies weights as multiplicative factors per-source before averaging; C ignores them entirely. PyTorch behavior is spec-compliant and more flexible. Semantic difference documented but not a bug. P3.0c blocker cleared; CPU/CUDA benchmarks (P3.2/P3.3) can proceed; Phase 3 decision (P3.5) unblocked.\n   218→    Next Actions: Mark P3.0c as `[X]` in plan; proceed with Phase 3 memo (P3.5) incorporating existing CPU/CUDA benchmark data and the 1024² CPU deficit analysis.\n   219→  * [2025-10-10] Attempt #22 (supervisor loop BD) — Result: invalidates Attempt #21. `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` mutates `simulator.source_directions/weights/wavelengths`, but the simulator only uses `_source_*` tensors populated from `BeamConfig` during `__init__`. The run therefore fell back to the single-source branch, so the recorded CPU/CUDA totals do not exercise unequal weights. Weighted-source parity evidence remains outstanding.\n   220→    Metrics: Analysis only (confirmed `_source_directions is None` after running the script).\n   221→    Artifacts: n/a — findings logged here and in `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` (P3.0c row).\n   222→    Observations/Hypotheses: Need a harness that feeds multi-source tensors through `BeamConfig` (or directly updates `_source_*` caches) before instantiating `Simulator`. Until that exists, P3.0c cannot close nor can Phase 3 be declared complete.\n   223→    Next Actions: Repair the validation script, regenerate CPU/CUDA results with unequal weights, archive outputs under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-multi-source-normalization/`, then resume P3.2/P3.3 and P3.5.\n   224→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #26 (ralph loop) — Result: P3.0c COMPLETE (validated). Fixed validation script to use repo-relative path (line 168-174), resolved FileNotFoundError. Re-ran validation successfully with weighted sources (2.0 & 3.0 weights, λ 6.2Å & 8.0Å) plumbed through BeamConfig constructor.\n   225→    Metrics: CPU total=5.750597e-05, CUDA total=5.750608e-05, rel_diff=1.771353e-06 (<0.0002% vs threshold 0.01%). Multi-source caching verified: directions shape torch.Size([2,3]), wavelengths [6.2Å, 8.0Å], weights [2.0, 3.0].\n   226→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/validation_results.json`; corrected `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` (Path-based output).\n   227→    Observations/Hypotheses: Validation now exercises BeamConfig-based source injection, confirming _source_* tensors are properly cached during Simulator.__init__. CPU/CUDA self-consistency proven with unequal weights. Phase 3 decision memo can proceed using existing P3.2/P3.3 benchmark data.\n   228→    Next Actions: Mark P3.0c as complete in plan.md; Phase 3 complete—all tasks delivered with valid parity evidence.\n   229→  * [2025-10-11] Attempt #27 (supervisor loop BH) — Result: follow-up required. Commit 0a78312 removed the absolute output path but still hard-codes the directory name (`reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/`), so repeated runs overwrite evidence and Phase A0 remains only partially satisfied. Plan updated to `[P]` with guidance to parameterise the stamp/CLI override before closing the task.\n   230→    Metrics: n/a (analysis only).\n   231→    Artifacts: plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md (A0 row updated).\n   232→    Observations/Hypotheses: Need dynamic stamping (e.g., timestamped directory or CLI argument) so future reruns land under `reports/benchmarks/<date>-.../` per plan expectations. Until then Phase A baseline capture remains blocked.\n   233→    Next Actions: Ralph to extend the script with an `--out` flag or timestamped default, rerun validation, and update plan/fix-plan entries with new artifact paths.\n   234→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #28 (ralph loop BJ) — Result: success. Added timestamped default directory and `--outdir` CLI flag to `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py`.\n   235→    Metrics: Validation run successful (CPU total=5.750597e-05, CUDA total=5.750608e-05, rel_diff=1.771353e-06). Core geometry tests 31/31 passed in 5.26s.\n   236→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-004135-multi-source-normalization/validation_results.json` (timestamped), `reports/benchmarks/custom-test/validation_results.json` (CLI override test).\n   237→    Observations/Hypotheses: Script now defaults to `reports/benchmarks/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-multi-source-normalization/` pattern, ensuring successive runs produce unique directories. CLI flag `--outdir` allows explicit override (relative or absolute paths). Fix unblocks Phase A baseline capture.\n   238→    Next Actions: Mark plan.md task A0 as `[X]` complete. Proceed with A1-A4 baseline benchmarks.\n   239→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #23 (ralph loop BC) — Result: Phase 3 decision memo written BEFORE Attempt #22 invalidation. Wrote comprehensive memo integrating P3.0–P3.4 deliverables and CPU/CUDA benchmarks assuming P3.0c was valid. Recommendation: DEFER Phase 4 (graph optimization) given CUDA meets all targets (1.55–3.33× faster than C across 256²–1024²) and only large CPU detectors (1024²) show deficit (2.4× slower).\n   240→    Metrics: CPU — 256²: 4.07× faster, 512²: 1.23× slower (within tolerance), 1024²: 2.43× slower. CUDA — 256²: 1.55× faster, 512²: 1.69× faster, 1024²: 3.33× faster. Cache: 37–6428× setup speedup. Correlations ≈1.0 throughout.\n   241→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/PHASE_3_DECISION.md` (decision memo - **PROVISIONAL pending P3.0c correction**), `reports/benchmarks/20250930-perf-summary/cpu/P3.2_summary.md` (CPU), `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220739/benchmark_results.json` (CUDA).\n   242→    Observations/Hypotheses: CUDA performance validates torch.compile effectiveness. 1024² CPU deficit likely stems from memory bandwidth (L3 cache pressure) and C compiler advantage for sequential loops. Production users prioritize GPU for large detectors. Phase 4 graph work has uncertain ROI given CUDA already exceeds targets. **NOTE:** Phase 3 decision memo is PROVISIONAL because Attempt #22 invalidated P3.0c weighted-source validation.\n   243→    Next Actions: Re-execute Attempt #22 corrective actions (fix validation script with BeamConfig-based weights), regenerate P3.0c artifacts, then update Phase 3 decision memo if weighted-source semantics change. Keep memo marked PROVISIONAL until P3.0c re-validated.\n   244→  * [2025-09-30] Attempt #24 (ralph loop BD) — Result: P3.0c COMPLETE (corrected). Fixed `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` to properly route weighted sources through `BeamConfig` constructor before instantiating `Simulator`. Script now converts wavelengths from Angstroms to meters, passes all source parameters via `BeamConfig`, and verifies multi-source caching with assertions. Re-ran validation successfully.\n   245→    Metrics: CPU total=5.750597e-05, CUDA total=5.750608e-05, rel_diff=1.771353e-06 (<0.0002% vs threshold 0.01%). Multi-source caching verified: directions shape torch.Size([2,3]), wavelengths [6.2Å, 8.0Å], weights [2.0, 3.0].\n   246→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/P3.0c_summary_corrected.md`, updated `validation_results.json`, corrected `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py`.\n   247→    Observations/Hypotheses: The old Attempt #21 validation was invalid because it set `simulator.source_*` attributes post-construction; these are never read—only `_source_*` caches populated from `BeamConfig` during `__init__` are used. Corrected approach passes sources through BeamConfig before construction, ensuring `_source_directions/_source_wavelengths/_source_weights` are properly cached. CPU/CUDA self-consistency now proven with unequal weights exercised. Phase 3 decision memo can be finalized.\n   248→    Next Actions: Mark P3.0c as `[X]` in plan.md; finalize Phase 3 decision memo (P3.5) removing PROVISIONAL status. Phase 3 complete—all tasks delivered with valid parity evidence.\n   249→  * [2025-10-11] Attempt #25 — Result: diagnostic blockers surfaced. Re-running `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py` on macOS fails with `FileNotFoundError` because the script still writes to `/home/ollie/.../validation_results.json`. P3.0c evidence cannot be regenerated until the path is made repo-relative. Warm-run CPU profiling after compile (512² detector, `torch.compile` cached) reports `Torch-Compiled Region` dominating (~3.8 ms) with `aten::mul`/`aten::sum` leading operations. Need eager-mode traces to quantify `Crystal._nearest_neighbor_lookup` advanced indexing cost and to measure the ~200 MB `_cached_pixel_coords_meters` tensor that likely drives the 4096² slowdown. Updated plan Phase A with task A0 (fix script path) and added Phase B task B5 plus Phase C tasks C6/C7 to capture these diagnostics before attempting new optimizations.\n   250→    Metrics: Profiling (512² warm) shows compiled region ≈66 % of CPU time; validation script stack trace terminates at `/home/ollie/.../validation_results.json`.\n   251→    Artifacts: Inline profiling output (no trace saved yet); updated plan `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md`.\n   252→    Observations/Hypotheses: Multi-source tooling must be path-agnostic; structure-factor gather and pixel-coordinate cache size remain top suspects for the 3.4× warm gap.\n   253→    Next Actions: Repair validation script output path (plan task A0), record eager-mode trace per B5, then execute C6/C7 experiments prior to any performance code changes.\n   254→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #29 (loop BK) — Result: Phase A COMPLETE. Executed baseline benchmarks (sizes 512–4096, float32, 5 iterations) capturing C and PyTorch timings simultaneously.\n   255→    Metrics: 4096² warm 1.783s (Py) vs 0.502s (C) → speedup 0.28 (Py 3.55× slower). 2048² warm 0.428s vs 0.136s → speedup 0.32 (Py 3.15× slower). 1024² warm 0.093s vs 0.044s → speedup 0.47 (Py 2.11× slower). 512² warm 0.006s vs 0.014s → speedup 2.22 (Py faster). All correlations = 1.000000. Cache setup speedup 6k–114k×.\n   256→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-005052-cpu-baseline/{benchmark_output.log, results/benchmark_results.json, phase_a_summary.md}`.\n   257→    Observations/Hypotheses: Performance gap at 4096² unchanged from prior benchmarks (was 3.4×, now 3.55×). Small sizes show PyTorch wins; large sizes confirm critical deficit. Cache system highly effective (warm setup <1ms). Deterioration pattern suggests memory bandwidth or allocator churn at scale. Ready for Phase B profiling.\n   258→    Next Actions: Proceed to plan Phase B tasks B1–B5 (capture torch profiler traces for 4096² warm run, eager-mode SF lookup profile, hotspot summary with % CPU time per op).\n   259→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #30 (loop BK) — Result: Phase B tasks B1-B2 COMPLETE. Added profiling instrumentation to `benchmark_detailed.py` and captured 4096² CPU warm trace.\n   260→    Metrics: 4096² warm 0.652s (Py) vs 0.524s (C) → speedup 0.80 (Py **1.25× slower**). Simulation time 0.613s. Cache setup <1ms (109,712× speedup).

Code changes: `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` (added --profile, --keep-artifacts, --disable-compile flags; integrated torch.profiler).\n   262→    Observations/Hypotheses: **CRITICAL FINDING:** Single-iteration profiling run shows PyTorch only 1.25× slower (0.652s vs 0.524s), dramatically better than Phase A baseline (3.55× slower, 1.783s). Possible causes: (1) Measurement variation (5-iteration average vs single run), (2) Improved torch.compile state, (3) Cache/memory layout benefits. **Action required:** Re-run Phase A with `--iterations 1` to validate whether gap is truly ~1.25× (near target) or ~3.5× (needs optimization).\n   263→    Next Actions: (1) Re-run Phase A baseline with single iteration for consistency, (2) Complete Phase B task B4 (extract hotspot % from Chrome trace), (3) Run B5 (eager-mode SF profile at 1024²), (4) Decision point: if validated gap ≤1.2×, skip Phase C/D; if >1.2×, proceed with diagnostic experiments.\n   264→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #31 (loop BL) — Result: Reconciliation study COMPLETE. Resolved 1.25× vs 3.55× measurement discrepancy by executing both 1-iter and 5-iter benchmarks at 4096².\n   265→    Metrics: **Current performance:** 1-iter: Py 0.609s vs C 0.528s (1.15× slower); 5-iter: Py 0.600s vs C 0.538s (1.11× slower). **Phase A baseline (for comparison):** Py 1.783s vs C 0.502s (3.55× slower). **Performance improvement:** 3.1× faster PyTorch (1.743s → 0.565s avg simulation time).\n   266→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-014819-measurement-reconciliation/{reconciliation_summary.md, quick_comparison.md, timeline.md, benchmark_results_1iter.json, benchmark_results_5iter.json}`.\n   267→    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) Iteration count does NOT explain discrepancy—1-iter vs 5-iter differ by only 1.6%. (2) PyTorch improved 3.1× between Phase A (00:50:52) and Phase B (01:01:28), most likely due to warm torch.compile cache state. (3) Current performance 1.11-1.15× slower meets ≤1.2× target (within 10% margin). (4) Phase A baseline appears to be outlier with cold cache state.\n   268→    Next Actions: (1) Mark Phase B task B4 complete with reconciliation summary, (2) Update Phase B decision to reflect **TARGET NEARLY ACHIEVED** status, (3) Consider Phase C/D optional \"polish\" work given proximity to goal.\n   269→  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #32 — Result: supervisor audit (no code change). Detected newly added benchmark set reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/ showing warm speedup_warm=0.299 (PyTorch 1.774s vs C 0.531s) — a return to the original 3.3× slowdown. This contradicts Attempt #31's 1.11× measurements and indicates the improvement is not yet reproducible.\n   270→    Metrics: 4096² warm totals — PyTorch 1.7738s, C 0.5306s.\n   271→    Artifacts: reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/benchmark_results.json; reports/benchmarks/20251001-025010/profile_1024x1024/trace.json (B5 eager profile).\n   272→    Observations/Hypotheses: Warm speedup hinges on cache state; without disciplined B6 reproducibility the plan cannot claim Phase B complete. Need cache-cleared reruns plus analysis contrasting 014819 vs 025148 results.\n   273→    Next Actions: Run B6 with explicit cache clearing notes, capture regression memo comparing both datasets, then update plan tables before entering Phase C.\n   274→  * [2025-10-01] Attempt #33 (loop CA) — Result: Phase B task B6 COMPLETE. Reproducibility study confirms stable performance at 1.21× slowdown.\n   275→    Metrics: 10 runs (5-iter averages each): mean speedup 0.8280 ± 0.0326 (PyTorch 1.21× slower), CV=3.9% (high reproducibility), correlation=1.0 (perfect numerical accuracy).\n   276→    Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20251001-030128-4096-warm-repro/{B6_summary.md, reproducibility_results.json, run1.log...run10.log}`.\n   277→    Observations/Hypotheses: (1) Performance is highly stable (CV<5%) confirming measurements are reliable. (2) Mean slowdown 1.21× exceeds ≤1.2× target by small margin (0.01×). (3) No runs achieved speedup ≥1.0 (range: 0.78–0.88). (4) **Phase B complete—target NOT met, proceed to Phase C diagnostics.** This addresses supervisor's Attempt #32 concern—B6 provides the requested reproducibility data showing stable 1.21× slowdown, not the 3.3× regression detected in 025148. Core geometry tests 31/31 passed.\n   278→    Next Actions: Execute Phase C diagnostic experiments (C1-C7) to identify remaining bottlenecks before considering optimization work in Phase D.\n   279→  * [2025-10-13] Attempt #34 (galph loop CG) — Result: Phase B re-opened. New benchmark log `reports/benchmarks/20251001-025148/benchmark_results.json` shows warm speedup≈0.30 (PyTorch 1.7738 s vs C 0.5306 s) even with cache hits, contradicting Attempt #33’s 0.828±0.033 average. Investigation found `scripts/benchmarks/benchmark_detailed.py` mutates `NB_DISABLE_COMPILE` when `--disable-compile` is toggled while the simulator actually reads `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`, so the flag is ignored and cached compiled simulators bleed across \"eager\" runs. Because the env var is also unset unconditionally, downstream callers inherit indeterminate compile state and benchmark logs lack mode metadata.\n   280→    Next Actions: (1) Implement Plan task B7 (push/pop `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE`, cache keyed by mode, compile-mode metadata). (2) Re-run the ten-run cold-process study per reopened B6 after patching the harness, capturing cache-hit + compile-mode flags in each artifact. (3) Draft reconciliation memo comparing the new roll-up against both the 025148 regression and 030128 reproducibility datasets, then update plan status before entering Phase C.\n   281→- Risks/Assumptions: 1024² CPU performance acceptable given GPU alternative; Phase 4 revisit only if future profiling identifies specific bottlenecks.

Analysis reveals significant differences in **real-space** rotation vectors (Angstrom scale) while **reciprocal-space** vectors show excellent agreement (~10^-9 Angstrom^-1).\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Reciprocal Vectors (Excellent Agreement)\n- `rot_a_star_A_inv`: Δ ≈ 2-4e-9 Angstrom^-1 (within numerical precision)\n- `rot_b_star_A_inv`: Δ ≈ 7e-11 to 5e-9 Angstrom^-1 (excellent)\n- `rot_c_star_A_inv`: Δ ≈ 4e-10 to 4e-9 Angstrom^-1 (excellent)\n\n**Result:** Reciprocal vectors match C to ~9 decimal places — this is near-perfect agreement.\n\n### Real-Space Vectors (Significant Drift)\n- `rot_a_angstroms`: Δy = +8.740e-03 Å, Δz = -3.436e-02 Å\n- `rot_b_angstroms`: Δy = +4.573e-02 Å, Δz = +1.089e-03 Å\n- `rot_c_angstroms`: Δy = +1.529e-02 Å, Δz = -3.832e-02 Å\n\n**Result:** Real-space vectors show O(10^-2) Angstrom differences, primarily in Y and Z components.\n\n## Magnitude Analysis\n\n| Vector | C Magnitude (Å) | PyTorch Magnitude (Å) | Relative Error |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| rot_a | 26.906 | 26.938 | 0.12% |\n| rot_b | 31.442 | 31.443 | 0.00% |\n| rot_c | 33.498 | 33.528 | 0.09% |\n\nThe magnitude differences are small (<0.12%), suggesting the issue is primarily **directional** rather than scale.\n\n## Hypothesis: Cause of Drift\n\nGiven that:\n1. Reciprocal vectors match to ~9 decimal places\n2. Real-space vectors show O(10^-2 Å) drift in Y/Z components\n3. The drift is directional (Y/Z) rather than isotropic\n\n**Primary Hypothesis:** The divergence occurs in the **real-space reconstitution** from reciprocal vectors.\n\n### Suspected Code Paths\n\n1. **Reciprocal → Real Conversion** (`Crystal.py:~400-450`)\n   - C: `nanoBragg.c:3006-3098` (reciprocal_to_real conversion)\n   - PyTorch: `Crystal.get_real_from_reciprocal()` or similar\n   - **Hypothesis:** Potential difference in cross-product order, volume calculation, or normalization\n\n2. **Spindle Axis Application** (`Crystal.py:~1000-1050`)\n   - C: `nanoBragg.c:~2800-2900` (phi rotation around spindle axis)\n   - PyTorch: `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors()`\n   - **Hypothesis:** Spindle axis normalization or rotation matrix construction may differ\n\n3. **Metric Duality Recalculation** (Rule #13 in CLAUDE.md)\n   - C performs circular recalculation: reciprocal → real → reciprocal (using actual volume)\n   - PyTorch: Check if `V_actual = a · (b × c)` is used vs formula volume\n   - **Hypothesis:** If PyTorch uses formula volume instead of actual volume, small errors accumulate\n\n## Recommended Next Actions (Phase L3g)\n\n### Immediate Probes\n\n1. **Volume Comparison**\n   - Add `TRACE_PY: cell_volume_formula <val>`\n   - Add `TRACE_PY: cell_volume_actual <val>`\n   - Compare with C's logged volume to identify which is used\n\n2. **Cross-Product Order Audit**\n   - Verify `a = (b* × c*) × V` vs `a = V × (b* × c*)` order\n   - Check sign conventions in reciprocal-to-real conversion\n\n3. **Spindle Axis Normalization**\n   - Log `||spindle_axis||` in both C and PyTorch\n   - Verify axis is properly normalized before rotation matrix construction\n\n### Implementation Priority\n\nSince reciprocal vectors are correct but real vectors diverge:\n1. Focus on `Crystal.get_real_from_reciprocal()` implementation\n2. Verify Rule #13 circular recalculation is followed\n3. Check metric duality test (`test_metric_duality`) passes with current parameters\n\n## Alignment with Spec\n\nFrom `CLAUDE.md` Rule #13:\n> The complete sequence is:\n> 1. Build initial reciprocal vectors using the default orientation convention\n> 2. Calculate real vectors from reciprocal: `a = (b* × c*) × V`\n> 3. **Recalculate reciprocal vectors from real**: `a* = (b × c) / V_actual`\n> 4. **Use actual volume**: `V_actual = a · (b × c)` instead of the formula volume\n\n**Action Required:** Verify PyTorch follows this exact sequence and uses `V_actual` from the reconstituted real vectors, not the formula volume.\n\n## Exit Criteria for Phase L3g\n\n1. Volume values (formula vs actual) logged and compared\n2. Cross-product order verified in real-space reconstitution\n3. Spindle axis normalization verified\n4. If drift remains >5e-4 in real-space components after corrections, escalate to supervisor\n\n## References\n\n- C trace: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`\n- PyTorch trace: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/trace_py_rot_vector.log`\n- Comparison table: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/rot_vector_comparison.md`\n- Plan: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase L3f/L3g\n- Spec: `CLAUDE.md` Rules #12, #13\n- C code: `nanoBragg.c:3006-3098` (reciprocal/real conversion)\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":856,"cache_read_input_tokens":97319,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":856,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"41050c03-3cd7-4a51-aacc-a90151a036bb","uuid":"298ecb36-b43a-4a26-a1f0-28a297c7fd53"}
