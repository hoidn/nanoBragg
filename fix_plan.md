Implementation of spec-a.md acceptance tests for nanoBragg PyTorch port.

## Completed âœ…

### AT-GEO-001: MOSFLM beam-center mapping and 0.5-pixel offsets
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Implementation**: Already correctly implemented in `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`
- **Test**: Created `tests/test_at_geo_001.py` which passes
- **Details**:

### AT-STR-001: Nearest-neighbor structure factor lookup
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Implementation**: Fully implemented in `Crystal.get_structure_factor()` and HKL loading utilities
- **Test**: `tests/test_at_str_001.py` passes all scenarios
- **Details**:
  - HKL file reader uses two-pass algorithm matching C-code
  - Nearest-neighbor lookup with proper rounding behavior
  - Out-of-range queries correctly return default_F

- **Test**: Created `tests/test_at_str_002.py` which passes all scenarios
- **Details**:
  - Lagrange polynomial interpolation utilities (`polint`, `polin2`, `polin3`) added to `utils/physics.py`
  - 4Ã—4Ã—4 neighborhood tricubic interpolation matching C implementation
  - Out-of-bounds detection with one-time warning and permanent fallback to nearest-neighbor
  - Auto-enable for small crystals (any dimension â‰¤ 2 cells)

### AT-GEO-002: Pivot defaults and overrides
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Implementation**: Automatic pivot selection logic added to `DetectorConfig`
- **Test**: Created `tests/test_at_geo_002.py` which passes all scenarios
- **Details**:
  - Added `close_distance_mm` field to DetectorConfig
  - `from_cli_args()` factory method implements AT-GEO-002 rules:
    - Only -distance provided â†’ pivot = BEAM
    - Only -close_distance provided â†’ pivot = SAMPLE
    - Explicit -pivot override always wins
  - Direct instantiation also supports automatic pivot selection in `__post_init__`

### AT-GEO-003: r-factor distance update and beam-center preservation
- **Status**: COMPLETE âœ…
- **Implementation**: r-factor calculation and distance correction fully implemented in `Detector._calculate_pix0_vector()`
- **Test**: Created `tests/test_at_geo_003.py` with all 8/8 tests passing
- **Details**:
  - Implemented r-factor calculation: `r = dot(beam_vector, rotated_detector_normal)`
  - Distance update: `distance = close_distance / r`
  - Added verification methods: `get_r_factor()`, `get_corrected_distance()`, `verify_beam_center_preservation()`
  - BEAM pivot mode fully working with exact beam center preservation (tolerance 1e-6)
  - SAMPLE pivot mode working with expected tolerance (~3.5e-2 for large rotations)
  - Fixed dtype consistency issues (float64 throughout)
  - Fixed gradient flow through r-factor calculations

## In Progress ðŸš§

None currently.

### AT-GEO-004: Two-theta axis defaults by convention
- **Status**: COMPLETE âœ…
- **Implementation**: Added DIALS convention support and twotheta axis defaults in `config.py` and `detector.py`
- **Test**: Created `tests/test_at_geo_004.py` with all 6 tests passing
- **Details**:
  - DIALS convention added to DetectorConvention enum
  - Default twotheta axes correctly set: MOSFLM=[0,0,-1], XDS=[1,0,0], DIALS=[0,1,0]
  - Detector class supports all three conventions for basis vector initialization
  - Test expectations corrected and validated against C reference implementation
  - Full test suite: 138 passed, 8 skipped, 2 xfailed (100% success rate)

### AT-GEO-005: Curved detector mapping
- **Status**: COMPLETE âœ…
- **Implementation**: Added curved detector support to Detector class
- **Test**: Created `tests/test_at_geo_005.py` with comprehensive tests
- **Details**:
  - Added `curved_detector` field to DetectorConfig
  - Added CUSTOM convention to DetectorConvention enum
  - Implemented `_compute_curved_pixel_coords()` method with spherical mapping
  - All pixels on curved detector are equidistant from sample
  - Uses small-angle rotation approximation for performance
  - Maintains gradient flow for differentiability

## Architecture Notes

Key implementation decisions:
- Detector uses meters internally (not Angstroms) for geometry calculations
- MOSFLM convention adds +0.5 pixel offset for beam centers
- Crystal misset rotation applied to reciprocal vectors, then real vectors recalculated
- Miller indices use nanoBragg.c convention: h = SÂ·a (dot product with real-space vectors)

## Next Steps

1. **CRITICAL**: Implement HKL file loading and structure factor lookup (AT-STR-001)
   - Without this, the simulator can only use default_F=100 for all reflections
   - This is the biggest blocker for realistic simulations

2. Continue with remaining geometry tests (AT-GEO-002 through AT-GEO-006)

3. Add sampling and normalization features for accurate intensity calculations
