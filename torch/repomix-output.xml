# nanoBragg C Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the `nanoBragg.c` codebase. It is intended for developers tasked with understanding, maintaining, or translating the logic to a new framework (e.g., PyTorch). It aims to explain the program's structure, data flow, and core computational model without delving into line-by-line implementation details.

The entire application is contained within a single monolithic C file, `nanoBragg.c`. It is a procedural program where the `main` function orchestrates all operations from start to finish.

## 2. Core Philosophy

The design of `nanoBragg` is guided by principles common in high-performance scientific C code:

*   **Forward Model:** The code directly simulates the physics of diffraction. It starts with a source (beam), interacts with a sample (crystal), and calculates the result at a sensor (detector).
*   **Procedural Execution:** Logic flows sequentially from top to bottom within the `main` function. There is no object-oriented abstraction; state is managed through a large number of local variables in `main`.
*   **In-Place Modification:** Functions frequently use pointers to modify data in-place rather than returning new structures. This is a memory-efficient C idiom. For example, vector math functions take an output pointer (`newv`) as an argument.
*   **Explicit Integration:** The simulation calculates a final intensity by explicitly looping over every contributing physical factor (e.g., every source point, every mosaic domain, every sub-pixel) and summing the results. This "brute-force" integration is the primary target for vectorization in a framework like PyTorch.

## 3. Execution Flow

The program executes in three distinct phases, all orchestrated within the `main` function.

        C7 --> C8[Accumulate Intensity into `floatimage` buffer];
        C6 -.-> C8

        D2{Add Poisson Noise (optional)} --> D3;
        D3[Write Output Files: .bin, .img, .pgm];
    end
```

## 4. Key Data Structures

State is managed by a large set of variables within `main`. The most critical ones are:

| Variable Name | C Type | Role & Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `floatimage` | `float*` | **The Main Output Buffer.** A 1D array of size `fpixels * spixels` that accumulates the calculated photon intensity for each pixel before any noise or scaling is applied. |
| `Fhkl` | `double***` | **Structure Factor Lookup Table.** A 3D array implemented with nested pointers (`h -> k -> l`) that stores the structure factor `F` for each Miller index. It is indexed relative to `h_min`, `k_min`, `l_min`. |
| `a`, `b`, `c` | `double[4]` | **Real-Space Crystal Vectors.** Store the crystal's unit cell vectors in the lab coordinate system (in meters). The `[0]` element stores the vector's magnitude. |
| `a_star`, `b_star`, `c_star` | `double[4]` | **Reciprocal-Space Crystal Vectors.** Store the reciprocal lattice vectors (in Å⁻¹). The `[0]` element stores the magnitude. These are the primary vectors used for calculating Miller indices. |
| `fdet_vector`, `sdet_vector`, `odet_vector` | `double[4]` | **Detector Basis Vectors.** A set of three orthogonal unit vectors defining the detector's coordinate system: fast axis, slow axis, and the direction normal to the detector plane (outward). |
| `pix0_vector` | `double[4]` | **Detector Origin Vector.** The 3D vector from the crystal's origin to the center of the first pixel (pixel 0,0) on the detector. This, along with the basis vectors, defines the detector's position and orientation in space. |
| `incident`, `diffracted`, `scattering` | `double[4]` | **Per-Step Ray Vectors.** These vectors are calculated inside the innermost loops. `incident` is the incoming beam vector, `diffracted` points from the crystal to the current detector pixel, and `scattering` is their difference, scaled by wavelength. |

## 5. Parallelization Model (OpenMP)

To accelerate the computationally expensive main loop, the code uses the OpenMP library.

*   **Directive:** The parallelization is implemented with a single `#pragma omp parallel for` directive.
*   **Target Loop:** The pragma is applied to the outermost loop over the detector's slow axis (`for(spixel=...;)`). This is a classic domain decomposition strategy where each available CPU core is assigned a block of detector rows to compute independently.
*   **Data Sharing Clauses:**
    *   `private(...)`: Loop counters and per-step calculation variables (`fpixel`, `h`, `k`, `l`, `scattering`, `incident`, etc.) are declared `private`. This ensures each thread gets its own independent copy, preventing race conditions.
    *   `shared(...)`: Read-only configuration data (`Na`, `Nb`, `Nc`, `Fhkl`, detector vectors) and the main output buffer (`floatimage`) are `shared`. Sharing `floatimage` is safe because each thread writes to a unique, non-overlapping section of the array (`spixel*fpixels+fpixel`).
    *   `reduction(+:...)`: Global statistics variables (`sum`, `sumsqr`, `sumn`) are handled with a `reduction` clause. Each thread computes a local sum, and OpenMP safely combines (reduces) these local sums into the global variable after the parallel section is complete.

## 6. External Dependencies

The codebase is self-contained but relies on standard system libraries that must be linked during compilation.

*   **C Standard Library:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `math.h`, etc.
*   **Math Library (`libm`):** Required for functions like `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `log`. Linked with the `-lm` flag.
*   **OpenMP Library:** Required for the parallel processing directives. Enabled and linked with the `-fopenmp` compiler flag.

# nanoBragg C Function Reference

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed reference for every function defined in `nanoBragg.c`. Its purpose is to serve as a quick lookup guide for developers translating or maintaining the code.

Each function entry includes:

# nanoBragg C Parameter Dictionary

## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a definitive reference for all command-line parameters accepted by `nanoBragg.c`. It maps each command-line flag to its corresponding internal C variable, specifies its data type, expected units, default value, and provides a clear description of its function.

This dictionary is essential for:
*   Understanding how to configure a `nanoBragg` simulation.
*   Guiding the implementation of a new configuration system (e.g., Python `dataclasses`).
*   Debugging by tracing user input to its effect in the code.

**Note on Conventions:** The C code handles multiple geometry conventions (e.g., MOSFLM, XDS) via conditional logic. The PyTorch architecture will use a single, canonical internal coordinate system. The user-facing command-line interface will be responsible for parsing legacy convention flags and converting them into the application's canonical parameter set before the simulation begins.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2023-10-27  
**Project Lead:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for translating `nanoBragg.c` into a new PyTorch-based application. The plan is structured to build the application from the ground up, starting with foundational utilities and progressively assembling them into the final, complete simulator.

Each phase represents a logical grouping of tasks and serves as a major milestone. A phase is not considered complete until all its associated code is implemented and all corresponding tests (as defined in `Testing_Strategy.md`) are passing.

**Prerequisites:**
*   The `C_Architecture_Overview.md`, `C_Parameter_Dictionary.md`, and `C_Function_Reference.md` documents are complete and have been reviewed.
*   The `PyTorch_Architecture_Design.md` and `Testing_Strategy.md` documents are complete and have been approved.
*   The "Golden C Code" test suite (instrumented C code, golden output images, and debug logs) has been generated.

## 1.1. Prerequisite - Developer Environment Setup

To support a consistent and maintainable development process, a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file and a `requirements.txt` file will be created as the first task. These will provide clear instructions for new developers on how to:
1.  Create a Python virtual environment.
2.  Install all necessary dependencies (e.g., `torch`, `pytest`, `fabio`).
3.  Run the complete test suite to verify their setup.
4.  Adhere to code formatting standards (e.g., `black`, `isort`).

## 3. Development Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation & Utilities

**Goal:** Create the low-level, reusable building blocks for geometry and physics calculations. This phase is critical as all subsequent components will depend on it.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Parameter Trace Analysis

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2023-10-27  
**Authors:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed, end-to-end analysis of how key physical parameters influence the final simulated diffraction pattern in the PyTorch implementation of `nanoBragg`. For each parameter, we trace its path through the computational graph, from its initial value to its effect on the final image intensity.

The purpose of this document is to:
1.  **Build Intuition:** Explain *why* a parameter affects the simulation in a certain way.
2.  **Guide Debugging:** Provide a roadmap for tracing unexpected behavior back to its source.
3.  **Interpret Gradients:** Offer a physical interpretation of what a calculated gradient means during an optimization or refinement task.
4.  **Onboard Developers:** Serve as a deep dive into the "cause and effect" relationships within the simulation model.

Each section follows a standard format:
*   **Parameter:** The name of the physical parameter.
*   **Forward Pass Trace:** A step-by-step description of the data flow during the simulation.
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:** A conceptual description of how the gradient flows back to the parameter via the chain rule.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** A plain-language explanation of what the gradient tells us.

## 2. Crystal Parameters

### 2.1 Mosaicity (`mosaic_spread_rad`)

*   **Forward Pass Trace:**
    1.  The scalar `mosaic_spread_rad` parameter scales a set of pre-defined, deterministic rotation angles.
    2.  These angles, along with a set of base axes, are converted into a tensor of `mosaic_umats` (3x3 rotation matrices) using a differentiable axis-angle-to-matrix conversion.
    3.  Each `mosaic_umat` is applied to the crystal's reciprocal vectors (`a_star`, etc.) after the main `phi` spindle rotation.
    4.  This results in a distribution of slightly different crystal orientations for each simulation step.
    5.  Each unique orientation produces slightly different fractional Miller indices (`h,k,l`) when dotted with a given scattering vector.
    6.  This cloud of `h,k,l` values is sampled by the lattice transform function (`F_latt`, e.g., `sincg`), effectively "smearing" or "blurring" what would otherwise be a sharp Bragg peak.
    7.  The final image intensity is the sum of contributions from all mosaic domains, resulting in broader, more diffuse spots as `mosaic_spread_rad` increases.
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:**
    1.  The gradient flows from the `loss` back through the `sum` operation to the intensity contribution of each mosaic domain (`I_contrib`).
    2.  From `I_contrib`, it flows to the lattice transform `F_latt`.
    3.  The gradient of `F_latt` with respect to `h,k,l` is largest on the steep flanks of the Bragg peak.
    4.  This gradient flows back to the rotated reciprocal vectors, then through the `matmul` operation to the `mosaic_umats`.
    5.  Finally, it flows through the differentiable axis-angle-to-matrix conversion back to the `mosaic_spread_rad` scalar.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** The gradient `dL/d(mosaic_spread_rad)` indicates how the loss would change with an infinitesimal increase in mosaic spread. If the simulated peaks are too sharp compared to the data, the loss is high on the peak flanks. The gradient will be negative, signaling the optimizer to **increase** the mosaicity to better match the broader experimental spots.

### 2.2 Unit Cell Length (`cell_a`)

*   **Forward Pass Trace:**
    1.  `cell_a` is a direct input to the formulas that calculate the base reciprocal lattice vectors. Specifically, a larger `cell_a` results in a smaller `a_star` magnitude (since `a_star` is proportional to `1/a`).
    2.  The `a_star` vector is used in the dot product `h = dot(scattering_vector, rot_a_star)`.
    3.  Therefore, changing `cell_a` inversely scales the calculated `h` values.
    4.  This shifts the entire grid of Bragg peaks in reciprocal space. On the detector, this corresponds to a radial scaling of the spot positions (d-spacing).
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:**
    1.  The gradient flows from the `loss` back to `h,k,l`.
    2.  The gradient `dL/dh` flows back through the dot product to `rot_a_star`.
    3.  It then flows back through the rotation operations to the base `a_star` vector.
    4.  Finally, it flows through the derivative of the cell calculation formulas back to the `cell_a` parameter.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** If the simulated spots are at the wrong resolution (e.g., all are 1% too close to the center), the gradient `dL/d(cell_a)` will be non-zero. It tells the optimizer whether to **increase or decrease** the unit cell size to make the simulated d-spacings match the experimental data.

### 2.3 Crystal Orientation (`misset_rot_x`)

*   **Forward Pass Trace:**
    1.  `misset_rot_x` is used to construct an initial rotation matrix `U_misset`.
    2.  This matrix is applied to the base reciprocal vectors *before* any other rotations (`phi` or mosaic).
    3.  This applies a global rotation to the entire reciprocal lattice.
    4.  On the detector, this manifests as a rotation of the entire diffraction pattern around a fixed axis.
    5.  This changes the `h,k,l` values for every pixel, altering the loss.
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:**
    1.  The gradient flows from the `loss` back to `h,k,l`, then to the fully rotated reciprocal vectors.
    2.  It back-propagates through the mosaic and phi rotations, then through the initial `U_misset` rotation.
    3.  Finally, it flows to the underlying `misset_rot_x` angle.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** If the entire simulated pattern is mis-rotated compared to the data, this gradient tells the optimizer **which way and how much** to rotate the crystal model to improve alignment.

## 3. Detector Parameters

### 3.1 Detector Distance (`distance_mm`)

*   **Forward Pass Trace:**
    1.  `distance_mm` directly scales the component of the `pix0_vector` that is normal to the detector plane.
    2.  This changes the 3D coordinates of every pixel, effectively moving the entire detector plane farther from or closer to the sample.
    3.  This changes the `diffracted_vectors` and therefore the `scattering_vectors`.
    4.  The effect is a change in the "magnification" of the pattern. A larger distance spreads the spots farther apart.
    5.  It also affects the solid angle correction (`omega_pixel`), which scales as `1/distance^2`.
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:**
    1.  The gradient flows from the `loss` back to `h,k,l` (due to spot position changes) and `omega_pixel` (due to intensity scaling).
    2.  The gradient flows from these intermediates back to the `scattering_vectors` and `diffracted_vectors`.
    3.  It then flows back through the detector geometry calculation to the `distance_mm` parameter.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** If the simulated pattern has the correct relative spot spacing but is globally too large or too small on the detector, this gradient will instruct the optimizer to **adjust the detector distance** to match the scale of the experimental pattern.

## 4. Beam Parameters

### 4.1 Wavelength (`lambda_A`)

*   **Forward Pass Trace:**
    1.  `lambda_A` appears in the denominator of the scattering vector definition: `S = (k_diff - k_in) / lambda`.
    2.  A longer wavelength increases the magnitude of `S` for a given scattering angle, effectively shrinking the Ewald sphere radius in reciprocal space (`1/lambda`).
    3.  This has a similar effect to changing the unit cell size: it causes a radial scaling of the entire diffraction pattern.
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:**
    1.  The gradient flows from the `loss` to `h,k,l`, then to the `scattering_vectors`.
    2.  The gradient `dL/dS` flows back to `lambda_A` via the derivative of the `1/x` function.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** This gradient indicates how to adjust the wavelength to better match the observed d-spacings. Its effect is highly correlated with `cell` and `distance`. In a typical refinement, `lambda` is often fixed if known, allowing the other parameters to absorb the variance.

### 4.2 Fluence (`fluence`)

*   **Forward Pass Trace:**
    1.  `fluence` is a simple, global multiplicative scale factor applied to the entire calculated `final_image` just before the loss is computed.
    2.  It does not affect the position, shape, or relative intensities of the spots; it only affects their absolute brightness.
*   **Backward Pass (Gradient) Trace:**
    1.  This is the simplest gradient path. The gradient flows from the loss back to the scaled image.
    2.  The derivative `d(Loss)/d(fluence)` is directly computed from the difference between the simulated and target images.
*   **Physical Intuition of the Gradient:** This gradient simply tells the optimizer whether the overall simulation is **too bright or too dim** compared to the data. It allows the model to learn the arbitrary scale factor between the simulation's physical units and the detector's raw ADU values.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Architecture Design

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2023-10-27  
**Authors:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Guiding Principles

This document outlines the software architecture for the PyTorch implementation of `nanoBragg`. The primary goal is to create a functionally equivalent, yet more modern, extensible, and performant simulator that leverages GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation for scientific modeling.

The design is guided by the following principles:

1.  **Object-Oriented Abstraction:** The flat, procedural structure of the C code will be replaced by a set of classes (`Crystal`, `Detector`, `Simulator`) that encapsulate related state and logic. This improves modularity and maintainability.
2.  **Vectorization over Loops:** The core design pattern is to replace the nested C loops with vectorized PyTorch tensor operations. All calculations will be performed on large, multi-dimensional tensors, where each dimension corresponds to a loop in the original code. This is the key to performance on both CPU and GPU.
3.  **Configuration via Dataclasses:** All simulation parameters will be managed by strongly-typed Python `dataclasses`. This provides a clean, self-documenting, and error-resistant alternative to the large set of variables in the C `main` function.
4.  **Differentiability by Design:** All custom functions and classes will be built using differentiable PyTorch operations, ensuring that the entire simulation is end-to-end differentiable with respect to its physical parameters.
5.  **Lazy Computation & Caching:** Where possible, expensive calculations (like generating pixel coordinates) will be performed once and cached within their respective objects to avoid redundant computation.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The application will be structured into several key Python modules and classes, promoting a clear separation of concerns.

### 2.1 Class Diagram

        -crystal: Crystal
        -detector: Detector
        -beam_config: BeamConfig

    Simulator --> Crystal : uses
    Simulator --> Detector : uses
    Simulator --> Config : uses
    Crystal --> Config : uses

    Detector --> Config : uses
    Simulator --> Utils : uses
```

### 2.2 Module & Component Breakdown

*   **`config.py`:**
    *   Contains Python `dataclasses` (`CrystalConfig`, `DetectorConfig`, `BeamConfig`) to hold all input parameters. This module has no logic, only data definitions. It serves as the single source of truth for simulation configuration.
*   **`utils/` (Utility Modules):**
    *   **`geometry.py`:** A collection of pure, vectorized functions for 3D geometry (`dot_product`, `cross_product`, `rotate_axis`, etc.). All functions must operate on PyTorch tensors, typically of shape `(..., 3)`, to support broadcasting.
    *   **`physics.py`:** A collection of pure, vectorized functions for physics calculations (`sincg`, `sinc3`, `polarization_factor`, etc.). These will also be designed to work on broadcastable tensors.
*   **`models/` (Core Object Models):**
    *   **`crystal.py`:** Defines the `Crystal` class. It is responsible for managing the unit cell, orientation, and structure factor data. Its key method will be `get_rotated_reciprocal_vectors()`, which applies spindle and mosaic rotations to its base reciprocal vectors.
    *   **`detector.py`:** Defines the `Detector` class. It is responsible for managing all detector geometry. Its key feature is the pre-computation and caching of all pixel coordinates into a single tensor via the `get_pixel_coords()` method.
*   **`simulator.py`:**
    *   Defines the main `Simulator` class. This class orchestrates the entire simulation, taking the `Crystal` and `Detector` objects as input. Its `run()` method contains the core vectorized calculation.
*   **`main.py`:**
    *   The main executable script. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments (using `argparse`), instantiating the config dataclasses, creating the `Simulator` object, running the simulation, and handling file I/O for the final image.

## 3. The Vectorization Strategy

This is the most critical part of the design, enabling high performance. The nested loops of the C code will be mapped to dimensions of PyTorch tensors.

### 3.1 Mapping Loops to Tensor Dimensions

| C Loop | Tensor Dimension Name | Example Size (`N_...`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `spixel` | `S` | `spixels` |
| `fpixel` | `F` | `fpixels` |
| `source` | `src` | `N_sources` |
| `mos_tic` | `mos` | `N_mosaic` |
| `phi_tic` | `phi` | `N_phi` |
| `sub-pixel` | (Handled within pixel coords) | `oversample` |
| `thick_tic` | `thk` | `N_thick` |

### 3.2 Execution Flow in `Simulator.run()`

1.  **Prepare Input Tensors:**
    *   `pixel_coords`: from `detector.get_pixel_coords()`. Shape: `(S, F, 3)`.
    *   `incident_vectors`: Generated from `BeamConfig`. Shape: `(N_src, 3)`.
    *   `mosaic_umats`: Generated from `CrystalConfig`. Shape: `(N_mos, 3, 3)`.
    *   ...and so on for `phi_steps`, etc.

2.  **Expand Dimensions for Broadcasting:**
    *   Use `torch.unsqueeze()` or `view()` to align all tensors for broadcasting. The goal is to create a virtual "hyper-tensor" where every combination of parameters is represented.
    *   Example: `pixel_coords` becomes shape `(S, F, 1, 1, 1, 3)`.
    *   Example: `incident_vectors` becomes shape `(1, 1, N_src, 1, 1, 3)`.

3.  **Perform Vectorized Calculation:**
    *   All subsequent calculations are performed on these broadcast-compatible tensors.
    *   `scattering_vectors = (unitize(pixel_coords) - incident_vectors) / lambda_A`
    *   This single line of code calculates the scattering vector for every pixel, for every source, simultaneously. The resulting tensor has a shape like `(S, F, N_src, N_mos, N_phi, 3)`.

4.  **Integrate (Sum over Dimensions):**
    *   The final intensity is calculated by summing the contributions over the appropriate dimensions.
    *   `I_contrib = (F_cell * F_latt)**2 * ...`
    *   `final_image = torch.sum(I_contrib, dim=(2, 3, 4))` (summing over `src`, `mos`, and `phi` dimensions).

This approach moves the looping from slow, sequential Python/C code into highly optimized, parallel C++/CUDA kernels within the PyTorch backend.

## 4. Memory Management and Batching

The full vectorization strategy is highly performant but can be memory-intensive, as the intermediate tensors can grow very large (e.g., `pixels * sources * mosaic_domains * ...`). To ensure the simulator can handle large-scale problems without exceeding GPU or system RAM, a batching mechanism will be included.

The `Simulator.run()` method will include an optional `pixel_batch_size` parameter. If provided, the calculation will be looped over the detector pixels in batches of the specified size. This approach allows for a trade-off: it slightly reduces performance by introducing a Python loop but drastically cuts peak memory usage, making the tool more robust and versatile for a wider range of hardware and simulation complexities.

## 5. Differentiability and Parameter Handling

*   **Learnable Parameters:** Any physical parameter intended for refinement (e.g., `cell_a`, `distance_mm`, `mosaic_spread_rad`) will be represented as a `torch.Tensor` with `requires_grad=True`. These will be managed within their respective `config` dataclasses.
*   **Gradient Flow:** The architecture ensures a continuous computational graph from these input parameters to the final scalar loss value. For example, the `Crystal` class methods will be fully differentiable, allowing gradients to flow back from `h,k,l` to the underlying cell and orientation parameters.
*   **Optimizer:** The `main.py` script will be responsible for creating a standard PyTorch optimizer (e.g., `torch.optim.Adam`) that takes the list of learnable parameters and updates them based on their `.grad` attribute after `loss.backward()` is called.

## 6. Data I/O

*   **Input:**
    *   HKL files will be read using `pandas` or a simple text parser into a dictionary or a sparse tensor format within the `Crystal` class.
    *   Configuration will be handled by `argparse` populating the `config` dataclasses.
*   **Output:**
    *   The final image tensor will be saved using libraries capable of handling scientific image formats. The `fabio` library is the recommended candidate for writing SMV files with correct headers. Alternatively, `astropy.io.fits` or simple `numpy.save` can be used for intermediate debugging.

# nanoBragg PyTorch Testing Strategy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2023-10-27  
**Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the PyTorch implementation of `nanoBragg`. The primary goal is to ensure that the new application is a **correct, verifiable, and trustworthy** scientific tool.

Our testing philosophy is a **three-tiered hybrid approach**, designed to build confidence layer by layer:
1.  **Tier 1: Translation Correctness:** We first prove that the PyTorch code is a faithful, numerically precise reimplementation of the original C code's physical model. The C code is treated as the "ground truth" specification.
2.  **Tier 2: Gradient Correctness:** We then prove that the new differentiable capabilities are mathematically sound, as this is a core feature not present in the original.
3.  **Tier 3: Scientific Validation:** Finally, we validate the model against objective physical principles and community standards to protect against any potential flaws in the original model and to establish scientific credibility.

All tests will be implemented using the **PyTest framework**.

## 2. Incorporating and Superseding the Legacy Testing Approach

The original `nanoBragg.c` implementation relies on an implicit, manual testing strategy common in scientific software:

*   **Example-Based Validation:** Running a series of well-understood examples from the `README.md`.
*   **Visual Inspection:** Manually viewing the output images to confirm they "look correct."
*   **Scientific Plausibility:** Checking that the output conforms to known physical principles.

While effective for initial development, this manual approach is not scalable, repeatable, or sufficient for a robust, maintainable software project.

Our new testing strategy is designed to **formalize, automate, and extend** this legacy approach.

*   **Formalizing Example-Based Validation:** The "Golden Suite" (Section 3) is the formal, automated version of the `README` examples. Instead of a human checking if the program runs, our integration tests check that the output is bit-for-bit identical to a trusted result. This makes the process objective and instantaneous.

*   **Formalizing Scientific Plausibility:** The manual check for physical correctness is captured and automated in the **Tier 3: Scientific Validation** tests. These tests programmatically check for adherence to Bragg's law and polarization principles, removing human subjectivity.

*   **Addressing Visual Inspection:** We acknowledge that automated tests cannot fully replace the intuition gained from visual inspection. However, by validating the PyTorch implementation against the C code's "golden" visual output, we ensure that no visual regressions occur. The primary role of visual inspection is now shifted to the validation of *new features* rather than the verification of existing ones.

By implementing this tiered, automated strategy, we retain the scientific spirit of the original validation methods while making them rigorous, repeatable, and capable of guarding against future regressions.

## 3. Ground Truth Establishment: The "Golden Suite"

The foundation of our testing strategy is a "Golden Suite" of test data generated from the original, trusted C code.

### 3.1 Instrumenting the C Code

The `nanoBragg.c` source will be modified to include a new command-line flag: `-dump_pixel <fpixel> <spixel>`. When run with this flag, the program will execute normally but will also write a detailed log file (`<test_case_name>.log`) containing key intermediate variables for the specified pixel at every step of the innermost simulation loops. This provides the ground truth for component-level testing.

### 3.2 Golden Test Cases

The following test cases will be defined and run using the instrumented C code to generate a set of golden output images and debug logs.

| Test Case Name | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `simple_cubic` | A 100Å cubic cell, single wavelength, no mosaicity, no oscillation. | The "hello world" test for basic geometry and spot calculation. |
| `triclinic_complex` | A low-symmetry triclinic cell. | To stress-test the reciprocal space and geometry calculations. |
| `with_mosaicity` | The `simple_cubic` case with a 0.5-degree mosaic spread. | To test the mosaic domain implementation. |
| `with_oscillation` | The `simple_cubic` case with a 1-degree oscillation over 10 phi steps. | To test the spindle rotation logic. |
| `full_features` | A complex case with all major features enabled (divergence, dispersion, mosaicity, oscillation, etc.). | The final, comprehensive integration test case. |

These golden files (`.img`, `.log`) will be committed to the repository and will not be changed.

## 4. Tier 1: Translation Correctness Testing

**Goal:** To prove the PyTorch code is a faithful port of the C code.

### 4.1 Unit Tests (`tests/test_utils.py`)

*   **Target:** Functions in `utils/geometry.py` and `utils/physics.py`.
*   **Methodology:** For each function, create a PyTest test that provides a hard-coded input. The expected output will be taken directly from the golden debug logs or calculated manually. Comparison will be done using `torch.allclose()`.
*   **Requirement:** All utility functions must have at least one corresponding unit test.

### 4.2 Component Tests (`tests/test_models.py`)

*   **Target:** The `Detector` and `Crystal` classes in `models/`.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **`test_detector_geometry`:** Instantiate the `Detector` class using the configuration from a golden test case. Assert that its calculated basis vectors (`fdet_vec`, etc.) and the 3D coordinates of the dumped pixel match the values in the corresponding `.log` file.
    *   **`test_crystal_geometry`:** Instantiate the `Crystal` class. Assert that its initial reciprocal vectors match the golden log.
    *   **`test_crystal_rotation`:** Call the `crystal.get_rotated_reciprocal_vectors()` method with `phi` and mosaic matrix values taken from a specific step in the golden log. Assert that the output vectors match the C code's rotated vectors for that step.
*   **Requirement:** Both `Detector` and `Crystal` classes must pass these component tests for at least the `simple_cubic` and `triclinic_complex` cases.

### 4.3 Integration Tests (`tests/test_simulator.py`)

*   **Target:** The end-to-end `Simulator.run()` method.
*   **Methodology:** For each test case in the Golden Suite, create a test function that:
    1.  Configures and runs the PyTorch `Simulator`.
    2.  Loads the corresponding golden output image (`.img` file).
    3.  Asserts that the entire output image tensor is numerically close to the golden image tensor using `torch.allclose(rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-5)`.
*   **Requirement:** The simulator must pass integration tests for **all** cases in the Golden Suite.

**Note on Precision:** All tests in this tier will be run with PyTorch's default dtype set to `torch.float64` to match the `double` precision of the C code and minimize floating-point discrepancies.

## 5. Tier 2: Gradient Correctness Testing

**Goal:** To prove that the automatic differentiation capabilities are mathematically correct.

### 5.1 Gradient Checks (`tests/test_gradients.py`)

*   **Target:** All parameters intended for refinement.
*   **Methodology:** We will use PyTorch's built-in numerical gradient checker, `torch.autograd.gradcheck`. For each parameter, a test will be created that:
    1.  Sets up a minimal, fast-to-run simulation scenario.
    2.  Defines a function that takes the parameter tensor as input and returns a scalar loss.
    3.  Calls `gradcheck` on this function and its input.
*   **Requirement:** The following parameters (at a minimum) must pass `gradcheck`:
    *   **Crystal:** `cell_a`, `cell_gamma`, `misset_rot_x`
    *   **Detector:** `distance_mm`, `Fbeam_mm`
    *   **Beam:** `lambda_A`
    *   **Model:** `mosaic_spread_rad`, `fluence`

## 6. Tier 3: Scientific Validation Testing

**Goal:** To validate the model against objective physical principles, independent of the original C code.

### 6.1 First Principles Tests (`tests/test_validation.py`)

*   **Target:** The fundamental geometry and physics of the simulation.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **`test_bragg_spot_position`:**
        1.  Configure a simple case: cubic cell, beam along Z, detector on XY plane, no rotations.
        2.  Analytically calculate the exact (x,y) position of a low-index reflection (e.g., (1,0,0)) using the Bragg equation and simple trigonometry.
        3.  Run the simulation.
        4.  Find the coordinates of the brightest pixel in the output image using `torch.argmax`.
        5.  Assert that the simulated spot position is within one pixel of the analytically calculated position.
    *   **`test_polarization_limits`:**
        1.  Configure a reflection to be at exactly 90 degrees 2-theta.
        2.  Run the simulation with polarization set to horizontal. Assert the spot intensity is near maximum.
        3.  Run again with polarization set to vertical. Assert the spot intensity is near zero.

### 6.2 Cross-Validation Test (Optional but Recommended)

*   **Target:** High-level agreement with community standards.
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  Choose a simple, common-denominator scenario (e.g., the `simple_cubic` case).
    2.  Configure and run a simulation using an independent, trusted software package (e.g., `cctbx.xfel`).
    3.  Run the PyTorch simulation.
    4.  Compare the **positions** of the brightest spots in both images. A direct intensity comparison is not required, as models may differ.
*   **Requirement:** The spot positions should agree to within a reasonable tolerance, confirming that our coordinate system and geometric conventions are not fundamentally flawed.
