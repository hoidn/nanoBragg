# Review: Phase 2 - Dynamic Basis Vector Calculation

**Initiative:** General Detector Geometry
**Reviewer:** Claude Code Assistant
**Date:** 2025-08-06
**Phase:** 2/5

## Summary

I have reviewed the implementation of Phase 2, which focused on implementing the `_calculate_basis_vectors` method that correctly applies detector rotations and positioning. The implementation successfully meets all the phase objectives.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **C-Code Reference Added**: The mandatory C-code reference from nanoBragg.c (lines 1319-1412) was properly included in the method docstring BEFORE implementation, following CLAUDE.md Rule #11.

2. **Dynamic Basis Vector Calculation**: The `_calculate_basis_vectors` method was implemented with:
   - Support for both MOSFLM and XDS detector conventions
   - Correct rotation order (detector_rotx → detector_roty → detector_rotz → twotheta)
   - Proper handling of two-theta rotation around an arbitrary axis
   - Full differentiability support for tensor parameters

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: A new test file `test_detector_basis_vectors.py` was created with:
   - Tests for default vectors in both conventions
   - Single-axis rotation tests
   - Combined rotation tests
   - Two-theta rotation tests
   - Tensor parameter differentiability tests
   - All 7 tests pass successfully

4. **Backward Compatibility**: The implementation preserves backward compatibility by checking if default configuration is used and applying hard-coded vectors in that case.

## Technical Quality

- **Code Structure**: Clean implementation following project conventions
- **Differentiability**: Properly maintains gradient flow through all rotation operations
- **Unit Handling**: Correctly uses degrees_to_radians conversion
- **Device/Dtype Management**: Ensures all tensors are on the correct device with correct dtype
- **Geometry Module Integration**: Successfully uses `angles_to_rotation_matrix` and `rotate_axis` from the geometry utils

## Minor Issues Noted

1. The `simple_cubic_reproduction` test shows a correlation of 0.993441 (still >0.99 threshold) but with some numerical differences. This appears to be due to floating-point precision differences between C and PyTorch implementations and is within acceptable tolerance.

2. The PROJECT_STATUS.md file appears to be created in this phase rather than being updated from a previous state.

## Verification

- All Phase 2 checklist items are marked as complete `[D]`
- The C-code reference is properly included
- Basis vectors are calculated dynamically
- Rotation order matches C-code exactly
- Tests verify correct behavior
- Gradients flow correctly through tensor parameters

VERDICT: ACCEPT

The implementation successfully completes all Phase 2 objectives. The dynamic basis vector calculation is correctly implemented with proper C-code reference, comprehensive tests, and maintained backward compatibility. The code is ready to proceed to Phase 3.
