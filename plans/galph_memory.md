- Reviewed VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002 plan & fix_plan; Phase A/B logged as complete and Phase C remains the active gate.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions to spell out Phase C1–C3 commands and artifact expectations so Ralph can resume profiling without ambiguity.
- Prepared input.md directing Ralph to run the Phase C1 profiler capture and log results under reports/2026-01-vectorization-gap/phase_b/.
- Quick audit of last Ralph commits (loops 286–287) shows productive doc work only; no regressions detected, keep current trajectory.

- Focus issue: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 (Phase M3 follow-up)
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Docs
- Action State: [ready_for_implementation]
- Notes: Initial focus logged before artifact edits.
- Updates: Marked Phase M1 complete in plans/active/test-suite-triage.md and refreshed Phase M2/M3 guidance; revised docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions to reflect Attempt #40 evidence and the upcoming Phase M2 suite run; regenerated input.md with explicit full-suite command, artifact map, and tracker follow-up instructions.
- Expectations for Ralph: execute the Phase M2 pytest command with new STAMPed artifacts, then update summary/tracker per How-To Map; if blocked, capture collect-only log and record blocker in fix_plan Attempts.
