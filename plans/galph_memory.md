- Reviewed VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002 plan & fix_plan; Phase A/B logged as complete and Phase C remains the active gate.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions to spell out Phase C1–C3 commands and artifact expectations so Ralph can resume profiling without ambiguity.
- Prepared input.md directing Ralph to run the Phase C1 profiler capture and log results under reports/2026-01-vectorization-gap/phase_b/.
- Quick audit of last Ralph commits (loops 286–287) shows productive doc work only; no regressions detected, keep current trajectory.

- Focus issue: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 (Phase M3 follow-up)
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Docs
- Action State: [ready_for_implementation]
- Notes: Initial focus logged before artifact edits.
- Updates: Marked Phase M1 complete in plans/active/test-suite-triage.md and refreshed Phase M2/M3 guidance; revised docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions to reflect Attempt #40 evidence and the upcoming Phase M2 suite run; regenerated input.md with explicit full-suite command, artifact map, and tracker follow-up instructions.
- Expectations for Ralph: execute the Phase M2 pytest command with new STAMPed artifacts, then update summary/tracker per How-To Map; if blocked, capture collect-only log and record blocker in fix_plan Attempts.

## 2025-10-11T19:54:21Z
- Focus issue: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Docs
- Reviewed Phase M2 chunked rerun artifacts (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T193829Z/summary.md`); 561/13/112 counts captured and failure clusters confirmed (C2 gradients, C8 MOSFLM offset, C15 mixed units, C16 orthogonality).
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md:48-51 with new Next Actions and logged Attempt #41; emphasised need for Phase M3 evidence bundle + tracker sync.
- Refreshed plans/active/test-suite-triage.md status snapshot (Phase M2 ✅) and Phase M/M3 tables (M2 [D], new M3c/M3d tasks tied to STAMP 20251011T193829Z).
- Generated input.md delegating tracker updates and creation of cluster summaries under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/` before moving to remediation.
- Ralph review: latest commit 6bea52a0 successfully executed chunk ladder and improved failure count; no regressions noted.
- Action State: [ready_for_implementation]

## 2025-10-15T00:56:52Z
- Focus issue: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 — C17 polarization regression triage
- Action type: Debug
- Mode: Parity
- Action State: [ready_for_implementation]
- Notes: Initial selection logged prior to artifact edits; triage complete this loop.
- Findings:
  - Targeted repro (`pytest -vv tests/test_at_pol_001.py::TestATPOL001KahnModel::test_oversample_polar_last_value_semantics`) fails only when `BeamConfig.nopolar=True`, confirming `compute_physics_for_position` legitimately returns `(Tensor, None)` and `Simulator.run` lacks the guard. Same root cause hits `test_polarization_with_tilted_detector`.
  - Attempt #46 artifacts (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_o/20251015T003950Z/summary.md`) logged 467/14/125 baseline plus new C17 regression and missing chunk 10 selectors; chunk ladder remains partially complete.
- Updates:
  - Marked Phase O tasks O1→[D], O2→[P]; added baseline recap + rerun prerequisites in `plans/active/test-suite-triage.md`.
  - Refreshed `docs/fix_plan.md` Next Actions (#5–6) to capture the STAMP 20251015T003950Z results and require the nopolar guard before rerunning the ladder.
  - Authored `input.md` directing Ralph to add the guard in `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py` (both oversample and pixel-center paths), rerun the two failing selectors, and stash artifacts under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/c17_polarization_guard/`.
- Ralph review: recent commit 31d34a40 captured Phase O evidence cleanly (9 chunks, logs + summary); no new code regressions beyond the identified C17 issue.
- Next expectations for Ralph: implement the nopolar guard, record targeted pytest passes, update trackers per How-To Map, then prep for the chunk 10 rerun once the guard lands.

## 2025-10-15T10:24:59Z
- Focus issue: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 — Phase R chunk 03 rerun readiness
- Action type: Review or housekeeping
- Mode: Perf
- Action State: [ready_for_implementation]
- Findings: R2 tolerance uplift already landed (timeout decorator + docs at 905 s with STAMP 20251015T100100Z); plan/fix_plan still listed it as pending.
- Updates: Marked Phase R status in `plans/active/test-suite-triage.md` with Attempt #83 completion, flipped R2 to [D], and pointed status text at the tolerance_update bundle. Synced `docs/fix_plan.md` (Next Action 16 now COMPLETE; logged Attempt #83 summary). Rewrote `input.md` to push Ralph toward R3 guarded chunk execution with explicit command roster + artifact expectations.
- Next expectations for Ralph: follow the new input.md to recreate commands.txt, run all four chunk 03 selectors under the guarded env, capture logs/summary/timing for STAMP $(date), and update fix_plan Attempts after the run.
