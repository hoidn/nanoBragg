- Reviewed VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002 plan & fix_plan; Phase A/B logged as complete and Phase C remains the active gate.
- Updated docs/fix_plan.md Next Actions to spell out Phase C1–C3 commands and artifact expectations so Ralph can resume profiling without ambiguity.
- Prepared input.md directing Ralph to run the Phase C1 profiler capture and log results under reports/2026-01-vectorization-gap/phase_b/.
- Quick audit of last Ralph commits (loops 286–287) shows productive doc work only; no regressions detected, keep current trajectory.
