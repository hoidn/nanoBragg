## Context
- Initiative: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 — obey long-term directive to run the full PyTorch nanoBragg pytest suite, capture failures, and classify them for remediation sequencing.
- Phase Goal: Establish a reproducible, artifact-backed understanding of current test health (`pytest tests/`) before authorising any other feature work.
- Dependencies:
  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative guidance for test ordering, environment variables, and smoke test expectations.
  - `arch.md` §2 & §15 — runtime guardrails (device/dtype, differentiability) that must stay intact during triage.
  - `docs/fix_plan.md` — ledger for logging attempts, failure classifications, and follow-up tasks.
  - `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` — sanity checklist before executing PyTorch-heavy tests (KMP env, device neutrality).
  - `prompts/callchain.md` — fallback SOP if targeted tracing is required for specific failures (defer until triage completes).

### Status Snapshot (2026-01-21)
- Phase A ✅ complete (Attempt #1 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_a/20251010T131000Z/`); 692 tests collected, no errors.
- Phase B ✅ complete (Attempt #5 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_b/20251010T135833Z/`); full suite executed in 1865 s with 50 failures captured across 18 clusters.
- Phase C ✅ complete (Attempt #6 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_c/20251010T135833Z/`); all 50 failures classified across 18 clusters, mapped to 10 existing + 8 new fix-plan IDs.

- Phase I ✅ complete (Attempt #11 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_i/20251011T042127Z/` delivers triage_summary.md + classification_overview.md with 36 failures classified; fix_plan updated accordingly).
- Phase J ✅ tracker maintained — `remediation_tracker.md` and `remediation_sequence.md` refreshed (Attempt #16) with determinism clusters cleared; Phase D4 closure appended C3 ✅ resolved and Sprint 1 progress advanced to 30.6% (9/17 failures retired).
- Phase K ✅ complete — Attempt #15 (rerun) + Attempt #16 (analysis + tracker) delivered the 512/31/143 baseline; Attempt #19 Phase D closure now recorded in `analysis/summary.md`, yielding the current 516 passed / 27 failed / 143 skipped snapshot.
- Phase L ✅ complete (Attempt #17 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_l/20251011T104618Z/detector_config/`); targeted detector-config rerun captured, failure brief authored, ledger pending tracker sync with `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]` remediation.
- Phase M0 ✅ complete — Attempt #21 (20251011T153931Z) executed the chunked rerun: 504 passed / 46 failed / 136 skipped, triage_summary.md refreshed with nine active clusters (C1–C9) and new quick-win priorities.
- Phase M1 ✅ complete — Sprint 0 clusters C1/C3/C4/C5/C7 closed (Attempts #21/#22/#25/#26/#27) with Attempt #28 capturing the M1f ledger/tracker refresh and Phase M2 brief; Attempt #29 verified the existing compile guard (10/10 gradchecks pass) and logged CPU artifacts, and Attempt #30 documented the compile-guard updates closing Phase M2 so Phase M3 prep can proceed.
- Phase M ⏳ pending — retains post-remediation validation gate once MOSFLM offset fix lands (dependent on `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]` Phase C1–C3 completion and targeted retest).

### Phase M1 — Sprint 0 Quick Fixes (C1, C3, C4, C5, C7)
Goal: Execute the Phase M0 priority ladder (Sprint 0) to retire 31 of 46 failures by addressing low-effort clusters owned by Ralph before gradient and MOSFLM work proceeds.
Prereqs: Phase M0 artifacts (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m0/20251011T153931Z/`) reviewed; implementation handoffs for `[CLI-TEST-SETUP-001]`, `[DETECTOR-DTYPE-CONVERSION-001]`, `[DEBUG-TRACE-SCOPE-001]`, `[SIMULATOR-API-KWARGS-001]`, `[SIMULATOR-DETECTOR-REQUIRED-001]` acknowledged.
Exit Criteria: Targeted pytest selectors for C1/C3/C4/C5/C7 pass on CPU (and CUDA where applicable), ledger + tracker updated with Attempt IDs, and a consolidated summary captured under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m1/<STAMP>/summary.md`.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1a | Harden CLI fixtures (Cluster C1) | [D] | Attempt #21 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m1/20251011T160713Z/cli_fixtures/`) added `-default_F 100` to 18 fixtures across `tests/test_cli_flags.py` and `tests/test_cli_scaling.py`; targeted selector now passes. |
| M1b | Tensorize detector beam centers (Cluster C3) | [D] | Attempt #22 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m1/20251011T162027Z/detector_dtype/notes.md`) updated `Detector.to()` to handle scalar beam centers; selector `pytest -v tests/test_suite.py::TestTier1TranslationCorrectness::test_sensitivity_to_cell_params` now passes and five C3 failures cleared. |
| M1c | Guard debug trace pre-polar accumulator (Cluster C4) | [D] | Attempt #25 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m1/20251011T164229Z/debug_trace/`) initialised `I_before_normalization_pre_polar` in both oversample branches and added the required "Final intensity"/"Position" summary lines. Selector `pytest -v tests/test_debug_trace.py` now passes; future regressions should capture before/after logs beside the new bundle. |
| M1d | Align simulator API usage (Cluster C5) | [D] | Attempt #26 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m1/20251011T165255Z/simulator_api/`) refreshed the CUDA graphs fixtures to instantiate `Simulator(crystal, detector, ...)` with positional arguments and captured before/after pytest logs. Module rerun now passes (3 passed, 3 skipped). |
| M1e | Provide detectors for lattice-shape tests (Cluster C7) | [D] | Attempt #27 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m1/20251011T170539Z/shape_models/summary.md`) added Detector instantiation in `tests/test_at_str_003.py`; targeted selector + module rerun now pass (7 tests). |
| M1f | Ledger + tracker update | [D] | Attempt #28 (20251011T171454Z) captured Sprint 0 closure in `phase_m1/20251011T171454Z/summary.md` (11 failures remain, 76% reduction), authored Phase M2 strategy brief (`phase_m2/20251011T171454Z/strategy.md`), and refreshed `remediation_tracker.md` Executive Summary + Tracker Table. Phase M2 now ready for delegation per strategy.md lines 127-145. |

### Phase M2 — Gradient Infrastructure Gate (Cluster C2)
Goal: Stabilise gradcheck coverage by resolving the donated-buffer compile constraint so gradient suites can run without manual intervention.
Prereqs: Phase M1 quick fixes merged; gradient owner (Ralph or designated specialist) available; consult `triage_summary.md:59`–`89` and `arch.md` §15.
Exit Criteria: Gradient selectors pass with `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1`, documentation updated with compile guard, and artifacts captured under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m2/<STAMP>/`.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M2a | Draft guardrail strategy | [D] | Attempt #28 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m2/20251011T171454Z/strategy.md`) documents the `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1` guard with links to `arch.md` §15 and `testing_strategy.md` §1.4; ready for delegation. |
| M2b | Implement/diff guard | [D] | Attempt #29 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m2/20251011T172830Z/gradient_guard/`) confirmed the guard was already wired; gradcheck selector `env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1 pytest -v tests/test_gradients.py -k "gradcheck"` now passes 10/10 without code edits. |
| M2c | Cross-device sanity (if CUDA available) | [P] | Optional: repeat gradcheck on CUDA when hardware is available; Attempt #29 documented a deliberate skip (CPU-only precision) in `phase_m2/20251011T172830Z/summary.md`. |
| M2d | Documentation + ledger sync | [D] | Attempt #30 (`reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m2/20251011T174707Z/summary.md`) landed compile-guard updates across `arch.md`, `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §§1.4/4.1, and `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md`; ledger + tracker references captured in the summary. |

### Phase M3 — Specialist Follow-Through (C6, C8, C9)
Goal: Stage remaining clusters for their owning initiatives so Phase M (post-fix validation) unblocks once MOSFLM and physics investigations complete.
Prereqs: Phase M1 + M2 closed; coordinate with `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]`, `[VECTOR-GAPS-002]`, and `[VECTOR-PARITY-001]` owners.
Exit Criteria: Each cluster mapped to its canonical plan with up-to-date status; interim reproduction commands verified.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M3a | Sync MOSFLM remediation (C6) | [D] | **Phase M3a complete (Attempt #31, 20251011T175917Z).** Consolidated C6 findings from `triage_summary.md:186-214` into `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T175917Z/mosflm_sync/summary.md`. Updated `plans/active/detector-config.md` Phase B tasks (B1/B2/B4 → [D], B3 → [P]). Documented reproduction commands (targeted/module/cluster), code locations (detector.py:78-142/612-690/~520), offset formula, test coverage gaps, and implementation handoff checklist. Blueprint ready for [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] Phase C delegation. |
| M3b | Assign detector orthogonality owner (C8) | [D] | **Phase M3b complete (Attempt #33, 20251011T181529Z).** Docs-only loop authored comprehensive owner notes at `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T181529Z/detector_ortho/notes.md` covering: failure context (1.49e-08 orthogonality error with 50°/45°/40° rotations), spec/arch references (§49-54, §87-89, ADR-02), code locations (detector.py:78-142/:238-299/:612-690), reproduction commands (targeted: `pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_017.py::TestATParallel017GrazingIncidence::test_large_detector_tilts`), remediation options (tolerance relaxation [recommended] vs orthonormalization vs rotation refactor), exit criteria, and open design questions. Ready for geometry specialist handoff; no blocking dependencies. |
| M3c | Scope mixed-units zero intensity (C9) | [ ] | Promote to `[VECTOR-PARITY-001]` Tap backlog; add callchain requirement referencing `triage_summary.md:277`–`303`. Store hypotheses in `phase_m3/$STAMP/mixed_units/hypotheses.md`. |

### Exit Criteria (Plan Completion)
- Phases A–K marked `[D]` once delivered (Phase H–K added for 2026 rerun, classification refresh, and remediation sequencing).
- Phase M0 artifacts archived with failure count +46 and Sprint ladder documented.
- Phase M1 + Phase M2 deliver expected failure reductions (≤15 failures remaining) with evidence bundles under `phase_m1/` and `phase_m2/`.
- All artifacts stored under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/` with timestamped folders and referenced in `docs/fix_plan.md`.
- `triage_summary.md` (Phase I) identifies categories for every failing test and maps each to a next action (bug fix, test removal request, infrastructure follow-up).
- `handoff addendum` plus Phase J tracker are approved (by supervisor) and actively steering remediation; once backlog execution is underway, archive this plan.

### Phase M — Post-Fix Validation & Suite Refresh
Goal: Confirm detector-config remediation clears C8 and refresh overall failure counts before the next sprint.
Prereqs: Phase M1 + Phase M2 closed; `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]` Phase C1–C3 complete; targeted detector-config pytest passes locally.
Exit Criteria: Phase M directory contains targeted + full-suite rerun artifacts, fix plan/tracker synced with updated failure counts.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Retest detector-config after fix | [ ] | Once MOSFLM offset patch merges, rerun `env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v tests/test_detector_config.py --maxfail=0`; archive under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/<STAMP>/detector_config/` with diff vs Attempt #17. |
| M2 | Full-suite validation sweep | [ ] | Execute `env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/ -v --durations=25 --maxfail=0 --junitxml=reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/<STAMP>/artifacts/pytest_full.xml`; ensure runtime guardrails per testing_strategy §§1.4–1.5. |
| M3 | Tracker + ledger sync | [ ] | Update `[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]`, `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]`, and `remediation_tracker.md` with new pass/fail counts; note residual failing clusters for Sprint 1.4 planning. |

### Metrics & Reporting Guidelines
- Capture total runtime, pass/fail counts, and slowest tests (top 25) from `--durations=25` output.
- For each failure category, note whether GPU/CPU impact differs (device neutrality check).
- Maintain Attempt numbering continuity in `docs/fix_plan.md`; include `pytest` exit code and timestamp.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Long runtime / timeouts:** If the full suite exceeds loop budget, split run via `pytest tests/test_*pattern*.py`; document split and recombine results in `triage_summary.md`.
- **Environment drift:** Re-run Phase A if dependencies change (new torch version, GPU availability changes).
- **Protected Assets:** Ensure `docs/index.md` references (`loop.sh`, `input.md`) remain untouched; do not delete artifacts listed there during cleanup.
- **Flaky tests:** Mark with `Needs Reproduction` status; capture rerun commands and conditions.
