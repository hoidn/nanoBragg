## Context
- Initiative: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 — obey long-term directive to run the full PyTorch nanoBragg pytest suite, capture failures, and classify them for remediation sequencing.
- Phase Goal: Establish a reproducible, artifact-backed understanding of current test health (`pytest tests/`) before authorising any other feature work.
- Dependencies:
  - `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` — authoritative guidance for test ordering, environment variables, and smoke test expectations.
  - `arch.md` §2 & §15 — runtime guardrails (device/dtype, differentiability) that must stay intact during triage.
  - `docs/fix_plan.md` — ledger for logging attempts, failure classifications, and follow-up tasks.
  - `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` — sanity checklist before executing PyTorch-heavy tests (KMP env, device neutrality).
  - `prompts/callchain.md` — fallback SOP if targeted tracing is required for specific failures (defer until triage completes).

### Status Snapshot (2026-04-??)
- Phase A ✅ complete (Attempt #1 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_a/20251010T131000Z/`); 692 tests collected, no errors.
- Phase B ✅ complete (Attempt #5 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_b/20251010T135833Z/`); full suite executed in 1865 s with 50 failures captured across 18 clusters.
- Phase C ✅ complete (Attempt #6 — `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_c/20251010T135833Z/`); all 50 failures classified across 18 clusters, mapped to 10 existing + 8 new fix-plan IDs.
- Phase D ✅ complete (D1–D4). This loop issued the supervisor handoff for `[CLI-DEFAULTS-001]` (input stamp 20251010T153734Z) unlocking remediation attempts.
- Phase E 🔄 reactivated (2026 refresh required): awaiting new Attempt capturing a fresh `pytest tests/` execution under `phase_e/` before downstream remediation resumes.

| C7 | Refresh fix_plan & plan linkages | [D] | Attempt #6 → Updated `pending_actions.md` with 8 new fix-plan IDs requiring creation plus status table for all 18 clusters. Plan tables (this file) refreshed to reference 20251010T135833Z timestamp. Ready for Phase D handoff. |

### Phase D — Remediation Roadmap Handoff
Goal: Produce a ready-to-execute backlog for Ralph (or subagents) to address failing tests without ambiguity.
Prereqs: Phase C checklist complete.
Exit Criteria: `handoff.md` summarising priority order, owners, and verifying commands; input.md instructions referencing highest-priority failure fix.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |

| D4 | Publish supervisor input template | [D] | ✅ 2026-01-13 — `input.md` updated with Parity-mode guidance targeting `[CLI-DEFAULTS-001]` (default_F fallback fix). |

### Phase E — Full Suite Refresh (2026 Re-run)
Goal: Capture an up-to-date end-to-end `pytest tests/` run so the failure ledger reflects current HEAD behaviour before remediation resumes.
Prereqs: Re-read `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §§1.4–1.5, confirm `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` and CUDA availability, ensure ≥40 GB free disk for logs/JUnit.
Exit Criteria: New Attempt logged with full-suite runtime ≤3600 s, artifacts stored under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_e/<STAMP>/`, and `docs/fix_plan.md` updated with refreshed pass/fail counts and failure cluster mapping.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance (including API / document / artifact / source file references) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Refresh preflight snapshot | [ ] | Run `pytest --collect-only -q` and capture env/disk summary in `preflight.md` (update Phase A template) to confirm no drift. |
| E2 | Execute full test suite | [ ] | Command: `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/ -v --durations=25 --maxfail=0 --junitxml=reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_e/<STAMP>/artifacts/pytest_full.xml`; store console log + `commands.txt`. |
| E3 | Summarise 2026 results | [ ] | Produce `summary.md` (pass/skip/fail counts, top durations) and `failures_raw.md`; compare against Phase B Attempt #5. |
| E4 | Update ledgers | [ ] | Append Attempt entry in `docs/fix_plan.md` `[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]`, note new cluster deltas, and link artifacts; include rationale if discrepancies vs 2025 run appear. |

### Phase F — Failure Classification Refresh
Goal: Reclassify the refreshed failure set into implementation bugs vs deprecated tests and update downstream fix-plan item statuses.
Prereqs: Phase E artifacts ready (logs, summary, failures_raw); consult `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_c/20251010T135833Z/triage_summary.md` for prior cluster definitions.
Exit Criteria: Updated `triage_summary.md` and `pending_actions.md` covering the 2026 run, plus synced `docs/fix_plan.md` links for any new or resolved clusters.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Extend triage worksheet | [ ] | Duplicate prior template under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_f/<STAMP>/triage_summary.md`; annotate each failure with 2026 status (regressed, resolved, new). |
| F2 | Map failures to fix-plan IDs | [ ] | Update or create fix-plan entries; ensure each cluster references authoritative specs/tests; archive deprecated tests rationale if any. |
| F3 | Record pending actions table | [ ] | Produce refreshed `pending_actions.md` noting owner, priority, reproduction commands; cross-link in `docs/fix_plan.md`. |

### Phase G — Remediation Coordination
Goal: Ensure remediation handoffs (determinism, CLI flags, dtype neutrality, etc.) remain prioritised in line with the refreshed failure ordering.
Prereqs: Phase F triage complete.
Exit Criteria: `handoff.md` appendix updated with 2026 priority ladder and supervisor input template refreshed for the leading remediation target.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Update remediation ladder | [ ] | Amend `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_d/20260113T000000Z/handoff.md` (or publish Phase G handoff) to reflect 2026 clusters; cite spec/test references per item. |
| G2 | Sync supervisor playbook | [ ] | Ensure `input.md` template and galph_memory entries reference the refreshed Do Now sequence; coordinate with `[DETERMINISM-001]`/`[CLI-FLAGS-003]` plans as needed. |

### Exit Criteria (Plan Completion)
- Phases A–G marked complete with `[D]` status in tables (Phase E onward newly activated for 2026 refresh).
- All artifacts stored under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/` with timestamped folders and referenced in `docs/fix_plan.md`.
- `triage_summary.md` identifies categories for every failing test and maps each to a next action (bug fix, test removal request, infrastructure follow-up) for the refreshed run.
- `handoff.md` approved (by supervisor) and used to steer subsequent loops; once remediation backlog is underway, this plan can move to archive.

### Metrics & Reporting Guidelines
- Capture total runtime, pass/fail counts, and slowest tests (top 25) from `--durations=25` output.
- For each failure category, note whether GPU/CPU impact differs (device neutrality check).
- Maintain Attempt numbering continuity in `docs/fix_plan.md`; include `pytest` exit code and timestamp.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Long runtime / timeouts:** If the full suite exceeds loop budget, split run via `pytest tests/test_*pattern*.py`; document split and recombine results in `triage_summary.md`.
- **Environment drift:** Re-run Phase A if dependencies change (new torch version, GPU availability changes).
- **Protected Assets:** Ensure `docs/index.md` references (`loop.sh`, `input.md`) remain untouched; do not delete artifacts listed there during cleanup.
- **Flaky tests:** Mark with `Needs Reproduction` status; capture rerun commands and conditions.
