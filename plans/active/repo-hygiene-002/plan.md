## Context
- Initiative: REPO-HYGIENE-002
- Phase Goal: Restore canonical C reference and remove unintended artifacts from commit 92ac528 so future parity diffs stay clean.
- Dependencies: `docs/fix_plan.md` entry for REPO-HYGIENE-002, git history around commit 92ac528, instrumentation SOP in `docs/development/processes.xml` (Â§C-parity workflow).

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | Capture pristine reference of `golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c` | [ ] | Use `git show 92ac528^:golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c > /tmp/nanoBragg.c.ref` (or diff directly) to confirm the pre-churn baseline before making changes. Keep the path handy for diffing. |
| H2 | Audit local `nanoBragg.c` for unintended edits | [ ] | Run `git diff 92ac528^ -- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c | head` to verify the entire file was replaced. Skim for any intentional instrumentation; if none, plan to restore from baseline. |
| H3 | Restore canonical file & stage minimal diff | [ ] | Replace local file with the captured baseline (e.g., `git checkout 92ac528^ -- golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c`). Ensure no other files change; stage only the intended restoration. |
| H4 | Remove stray artifacts under `reports/2025-09-30-AT-021-traces/` | [ ] | Delete or archive the autogenerated logs/images into `reports/archive/2025-09-30-AT-021-traces/` per SOP. Confirm `git status` no longer shows these files. |
| H5 | Re-run targeted parity smoke tests | [ ] | Execute `NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg pytest -v tests/test_parity_matrix.py -k "AT-PARALLEL-021 or AT-PARALLEL-024"` to ensure the restored C binary still passes parity essentials. Capture metrics.json for the run. |
| H6 | Document cleanup & close item | [ ] | Update `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempts History with commands + artifacts, and move this plan to `plans/archive/` once complete. Commit as `SUPERVISOR: repo hygiene - tests: parity AT-021/024`. |
