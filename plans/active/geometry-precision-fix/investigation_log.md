# Geometry Precision Investigation Log

**Start Date:** 2025-01-29  
**End Date:** 2025-01-29  
**Issue:** 1% error in fundamental geometric identities after implementing C-code crystallographic conventions
**Status:** RESOLVED

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Understand Current Implementation
- [x] Review the exact C-code formulas in `compute_cell_tensors()`
- [x] Identify all trigonometric and cross-product operations
- [x] Check tensor dtype consistency throughout

### Step 2: Create Minimal Reproducible Case
- [x] Extract failing test case parameters
- [x] Create standalone script to reproduce the 1% error
- [x] Test with simple cases (cubic) vs complex (triclinic)

### Step 3: Precision Tracking
- [x] Add logging of intermediate values with full precision
- [x] Compare each step with C-code output
- [x] Identify first divergence point

### Step 4: Common Numerical Issues to Check
- [x] Loss of significance in subtraction - NOT THE ISSUE
- [x] Accumulated errors in cross products - NOT THE ISSUE
- [x] Order of operations affecting precision - NOT THE ISSUE
- [x] Mixed precision operations - NOT THE ISSUE

## Root Cause Found

The issue was NOT a numerical precision problem, but a missing step in the algorithm:

1. **Missing Step**: The C-code recalculates reciprocal vectors from real vectors after the initial calculation (lines 1951-1956)
2. **Volume Discrepancy**: The C-code uses the actual volume from vectors (V = a·(b×c)) rather than the formula volume
3. **Result**: Formula gives V=524025.7 while vectors give V=527350.0 (0.6% difference)

## Solution Applied

1. Added reciprocal vector recalculation from real vectors
2. Used actual volume from vectors for final reciprocal vector scaling
3. Added numerical bounds checking for degenerate cases

## Verification

- Metric duality now exact to machine precision (error < 1e-16)
- All geometry tests pass with strict tolerances (rtol=1e-12)
- No regression in integration tests (correlations maintained)
