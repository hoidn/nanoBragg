## Context
- Initiative: CLI Parity for nanoBragg PyTorch vs C (supports long-term goal in prompts/supervisor.md)
- Phase Goal: Accept `-nonoise` and `-pix0_vector_mm` flags with C-equivalent semantics so the parallel comparison command in prompts/supervisor.md executes end-to-end.
- Dependencies: specs/spec-a-cli.md §§3.2–3.4, docs/architecture/detector.md §5, docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md (detector pivot + noise), golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c lines 720–1040 & 1730–1860 (flag behavior), docs/debugging/detector_geometry_checklist.md (pix0 validation), docs/development/testing_strategy.md §2 (CLI parity tests).
- Current gap snapshot: CLI flag parsing and detector override handling now land; remaining gaps are documentation updates (Phase C3/C4) and unresolved physics parity — Phase D3 showed geometry mismatch requiring Phase E trace comparison before implementation fixes.
- Newly observed gap (2025-10-16): CLI ignores `-beam_vector`, so PyTorch runs retain the default +Z beam direction instead of the custom vector (`0.00051387949, 0, -0.99999986`) used by the supervisor command. This must be captured in Phase E evidence and resolved alongside the pix0 transform port.

### Phase A — Requirements & Trace Alignment
Goal: Confirm the authoritative semantics for both flags and capture the C reference behavior (including unit expectations) before touching implementation.
Prereqs: Ability to run instrumented C binary via `NB_C_BIN` and collect traces.
Exit Criteria: Documented parity notes under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/` with explicit decisions on unit conversions and noise toggle ordering.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Extract C reference for `-nonoise` | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command captured with/without `-nonoise`; logs stored under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/`. |
| A2 | Capture pix0 vector ground truth | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Instrumented C trace recorded pix0 vector values; confirms outputs remain in meters even for `_mm` flag. |
| A3 | Update findings memo | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Phase A summary authored in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_a/README.md` documenting semantics and CUSTOM convention side effects. |

### Phase B — CLI & Config Wiring
Goal: Teach the PyTorch CLI to parse both flags, thread them through configs, and respect overrides in Detector/Noise handling without breaking existing behavior.
Prereqs: Phase A report published; confirm existing CLI regression tests green (run `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_cli_entrypoint.py -q` if available).
Exit Criteria: `nanoBragg --help` lists both flags; manual dry run of supervisor command completes argument parsing and produces float image without raising.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Extend argparse surface | [D] | `create_parser()` now exposes both flags (see `src/nanobrag_torch/__main__.py:187-206`); keep help text aligned with `nanoBragg.c` usage block. |
| B2 | Thread `-nonoise` to simulator | [D] | `parse_and_validate_args()` records `suppress_noise`, and the noise writer at `__main__.py:1170-1199` skips SMV noise output when true. Add warning copy before closing Phase C. |
| B3 | Support pix0 overrides | [D] | Fixed detector override assignment bug (2025-10-05). `_calculate_pix0_vector()` now assigns to `self.pix0_vector` and sets `r_factor=1.0`, `distance_corrected=distance`. Device/dtype coercion preserved via `.to()`. Verified: CLI `-pix0_vector_mm 100 200 300` → tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]). |
| B4 | Preserve meter and mm flag parity | [D] | Run paired parser smoke checks proving `-pix0_vector` (meters) and `-pix0_vector_mm` (millimetres) yield identical `pix0_override_m` tensors and that dual-flag usage raises `ValueError`. Record commands + stdout in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_b/detector/pix0_override_equivalence.txt`. ✅ 2025-10-05: Verified parser equivalence and dual-flag ValueError handling. |
| B5 | Unit & cache hygiene | [D] | Capture a detector mini-harness (`PYTHONPATH=src KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE python - <<'PY' …`) showing `Detector(..., pix0_override_m=...)` preserves device/dtype after `invalidate_cache()` and when moved across CPU/CUDA. Store log in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_b/detector/cache_handoff.txt`; note any follow-on assertions needed in code/tests. ✅ 2025-10-05: Cache stability confirmed on CPU/CUDA with device/dtype preservation. |

### Phase C — Validation & Documentation
Goal: Prove parity via targeted tests and update docs/fix_plan so future loops know the flags are supported.
Prereqs: Phase B code ready; editable install available for CLI tests.
Exit Criteria: Tests and documentation changes landed; supervisor command successfully runs PyTorch CLI and reaches simulator without flag errors.

**Parity risk reminder:** C instrumentation shows `DETECTOR_PIX0_VECTOR` emitted in meters even when using `-pix0_vector_mm`. During Phase C2 parity run, capture both C and PyTorch pix0 traces to confirm we are not double-converting the override.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Add CLI regression tests | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-16 (commit b6c6a61). `tests/test_cli_flags.py` covers meters/mm aliases, mutual exclusion, override persistence (CPU/CUDA), dtype preservation, and `-nonoise` suppression. |
| C2 | Golden parity smoke | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-05: Supervisor command executed for both binaries. C max_I=446.254 (img.bin), PyTorch max_I≈1.15e5 (torch_img.bin). Logs + float images archived under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_c/parity/`. Intensity scale mismatch noted for follow-up. |
| C3 | Update documentation | [ ] | Refresh `specs/spec-a-cli.md` and `README_PYTORCH.md` flag tables, note alias in `docs/architecture/c_parameter_dictionary.md`, and reference this plan from `docs/fix_plan.md` (new item) so future loops close it. |
| C4 | Fix-plan & plan closure | [ ] | Add new fix_plan entry (e.g., `[CLI-FLAGS-003]`) pointing to this plan; set completion criteria (tests, docs, command run). Once tasks pass, close plan and archive per SOP. |

### Phase D — Integration Follow-Through
Goal: Confirm no regressions in noise/geometry subsystems and capture open risks for longer-term initiatives.
Prereqs: Phases A–C complete.
Exit Criteria: Regression sweep documented, outstanding risks rolled into relevant plans (e.g., detector caching, noise modeling).

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Run targeted regression suite | [ ] | Execute `env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest tests/test_noise_generation.py tests/test_detector_pix0.py -v`; ensure existing tolerances hold with overrides. |
| D2 | Record residual risks | [ ] | Append summary to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_d/notes.md` covering any limitations (e.g., lack of `_mm` alias upstream, CUSTOM convention edge cases). Link to relevant active plans if work remains. |
| D3 | Investigate intensity scaling gap | [D] | ✅ 2025-10-06: Phase C2 artifacts analysed; determined discrepancy is geometric (zero correlation, peaks displaced by 1.5k pixels). Artifacts under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_d/`. See Notes below for mandatory follow-up trace work. |

### Phase E — Parallel Trace Root Cause
Goal: Pinpoint the first physics divergence between C and PyTorch for the supervisor command using the mandated parallel trace workflow.
Prereqs: Phase D3 report published; C binary ready for instrumentation (`NB_C_BIN=./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg`).
Exit Criteria: Trace comparison identifies first divergent variable; findings logged in `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/trace_comparison.md` and summarized in docs/fix_plan.md `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Attempts.

| ID | Task Description | State | How/Why & Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E0 | Verify beam vector parity | [ ] | Execute a one-off snippet (e.g. `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE PYTHONPATH=src python - <<'PY' …`) that instantiates the CLI configs for the supervisor command and prints `Detector(...).beam_vector`; capture stdout under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/beam_vector_check.txt`. Expect C trace beam direction `0.00051387949 0 -0.99999986`; PyTorch currently returns `[0, 0, 1]`, marking the earliest divergence before pix0 transforms. |
| E1 | Instrument C trace for peak pixel | [ ] | Add temporary `TRACE_C:` prints (pix0_vector, incident_beam_direction, scattering_vector, h/k/l, F_cell, F_latt, omega) for pixel (slow=1039, fast=685); build via `make -C golden_suite_generator`. Store log at `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/c_trace.log`. |
| E2 | Generate matching PyTorch trace | [ ] | Use `scripts/debug_pixel_trace.py` (or purpose-built harness) to log identical variables for the same pixel; respect `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE`. Save to `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_e/pytorch_trace.log`. |
| E3 | Diff traces and identify first divergence | [ ] | Perform line-by-line comparison (e.g., `diff -u`) and document the first mismatched value in `trace_comparison.md`, including hypotheses referencing spec lines. Update docs/fix_plan.md `[CLI-FLAGS-003]` Attempt history with divergence summary. |
