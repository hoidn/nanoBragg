# PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 3 Decision Memo

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Author:** Ralph (via galph supervision)
**Status:** PROVISIONAL (P3.0c weighted-source validation invalidated 2025-10-10 - see fix_plan.md Attempt #22)
**Plan Reference:** `plans/active/perf-pytorch-compile-refactor/plan.md` Phase 3

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This memo was written assuming P3.0c weighted-source validation was complete. Supervisor loop BD (2025-10-10) discovered that the validation script did not properly exercise multi-source weights through BeamConfig, so P3.0c evidence is invalid. The CUDA/CPU performance findings and Phase 4 deferral recommendation remain valid, but weighted-source normalization validation must be re-executed before marking Phase 3 truly complete.

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 steady-state performance analysis **COMPLETE**. torch.compile caching delivers 4376–6428× setup speedup and enables production-ready performance for small-to-medium detectors (256²–512²). Large CPU detectors (1024²) remain 2.4× slower than C, but **CUDA performance exceeds targets across all sizes** (1.55–3.33× faster than C).

**RECOMMENDATION:** Close out Phase 3 with current gains. **DEFER Phase 4** (graph optimization) unless future profiling identifies specific bottlenecks for 1024²+ CPU workloads.

## Performance Results

### CPU Performance (256²–1024²)

| Size | C (s) | PyTorch WARM (s) | Speedup | Correlation | Target | Status |
|------|-------|------------------|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 256² | 0.012 | 0.003 | **4.07× faster** | 1.0 | ≤1.5× C | ✅ PASS |
| 512² | 0.020 | 0.025 | 0.82× (1.23× slower) | 1.0 | ≤1.5× C | ✅ PASS |
| 1024² | 0.041 | 0.099 | 0.41× (2.43× slower) | 1.0 | ≤1.5× C | ❌ FAIL |

**Cache Setup:** All sizes <10ms warm (4376–6428× speedup vs cold) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- Small detectors (256²) are **faster than C** when warm
- Medium detectors (512²) within acceptable tolerance
- Large CPU detectors (1024²) still **2.4× slower** (exceeds 1.5× target)

### CUDA Performance (256²–1024²)

| Size | C (s) | PyTorch WARM (s) | Speedup | Correlation | Target | Status |
|------|-------|------------------|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 256² | 0.0106 | 0.0068 | **1.55× faster** | 1.0 | ≤1.5× C | ✅ PASS |
| 512² | 0.0130 | 0.0077 | **1.69× faster** | 1.0 | ≤1.5× C | ✅ PASS |
| 1024² | 0.0403 | 0.0121 | **3.33× faster** | 1.0 | ≤1.5× C | ✅ PASS |

**Cache Setup:** All sizes ≤18ms warm ✅

**Key Findings:**
- **All CUDA sizes exceed performance targets**
- 1024² GPU run is **3.3× faster than C**, resolving the CPU deficit
- Gradient flow preserved (`distance_mm.grad = -70.37` in smoke tests)

**Artifact Paths:**
- `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220739/benchmark_results.json`
- `reports/benchmarks/20250930-220755/benchmark_results.json`

## Multi-Source Normalization (P3.0c)

**Finding:** PyTorch correctly implements `steps / n_sources` normalization per AT-SRC-001. C code **ignores `source_I` weights** (line 2616 overwrites with `I_bg`), making weighted C↔Py parity impossible.

**CPU/CUDA Self-Consistency:**
- CPU total: 8.914711e-05
- CUDA total: 8.914727e-05
- Relative difference: **1.80e-06 (<0.01%)** ✅

**Decision:** Accept PyTorch implementation as authoritative for weighted sources. Semantic difference documented in `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/P3.0c_summary.md`.

**Evidence:**
- Validation script: `scripts/validate_weighted_source_normalization.py`
- Test: `tests/test_multi_source_integration.py::test_multi_source_intensity_normalization` PASSED
- Artifacts: `reports/benchmarks/20250930-multi-source-normalization/`

## Analysis: 1024² CPU Deficit

### Hypothesis

The 2.4× slowdown for large CPU detectors likely stems from:
1. **Memory bandwidth pressure:** 1M-pixel float32 arrays (1024×1024×4 bytes = 4MB each) exceed L3 cache
2. **Vectorization overhead:** torch.compile generates optimized kernels but still incurs per-element cost for large reductions
3. **C compiler advantage:** GCC/Clang optimize sequential loops for cache locality better than PyTorch's broadcast operations

### Evidence Against Further Optimization

1. **CUDA resolves the issue:** 1024² GPU is 3.3× faster, so the deficit is CPU-specific
2. **Production context:** Most compute-intensive workflows use GPU; CPU typically reserved for prototyping/debugging
3. **Diminishing returns:** Phase 4 (Triton/graph optimization) would require weeks of effort with uncertain payoff

### Recommendation

**Accept 1024² CPU performance as-is** and document as a known limitation:
- Users needing large-detector throughput should use CUDA
- CPU remains viable for 256²–512² grids and prototyping
- Revisit only if profiling future workloads identifies specific bottlenecks (e.g., 4096²+ grids)

---

## Phase 4 Decision: DEFER

### Rationale

- **Primary goals achieved:** Cache reuse validated, GPU performance exceeds targets
- **CPU deficit scoped:** Only affects 1024²+ grids (not 256²/512²)
- **Opportunity cost:** Phase 4 graph work competes with AT-PARALLEL parity tasks
- **Production impact:** Minimal (GPU is primary compute path for large detectors)

### Deferral Conditions

Phase 4 (graph optimization) should be revisited IF:
1. User reports identify 1024²+ CPU as a critical bottleneck
2. Profiling shows specific Dynamo graph breaks causing slowdown
3. Phase 4 effort can be scoped to <1 week with measurable improvement

Until then, **close out PERF-PYTORCH-004** and prioritize remaining AT-PARALLEL parity work.

## Conclusions

### Achievements

1. **Cache reuse validated:** torch.compile delivers 37–6428× setup speedup across devices/dtypes
2. **GPU performance excellent:** All sizes 1.55–3.33× faster than C
3. **Physics correctness preserved:** Correlations ≈1.0, gradient flow intact
4. **Multi-source semantics clarified:** PyTorch weighted normalization documented as spec-compliant

### Known Limitations

- **1024² CPU: 2.4× slower than C** (acceptable given GPU alternative)
- **C weighted-source parity impossible:** C ignores weights (documented in P3.0c summary)

### Final Recommendation

**CLOSE OUT PERF-PYTORCH-004 Phase 3** with current gains. Mark Phase 4 as **CONDITIONAL** (defer unless future profiling justifies graph optimization).

**Next Steps:**
1. Update `docs/fix_plan.md` with Phase 3 completion and deferral decision
2. Update plan status: P3.5 ✅, Phase 4 marked "CONDITIONAL (deferred)"
3. Return focus to AT-PARALLEL-012 peak matching regression (DTYPE-DEFAULT-001 blocker)
