# First Win Achievement: PyTorch nanoBragg Crystallographic Physics Engine

## üéØ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Working Crystallographic Diffraction Simulation**

The PyTorch nanoBragg implementation has successfully achieved its **"First Win"** milestone - a scientifically correct crystallographic diffraction simulation that produces discrete Bragg peaks in the correct geometric positions, demonstrating that all core physics are working properly.

## ‚úÖ **Critical Breakthrough: Correct Crystallographic Convention**

### **The Root Cause Resolution**
The final breakthrough came from implementing the correct crystallographic convention consistently throughout the simulation:

- **Problem**: Mixed convention error - using physics scattering vector (with 2œÄ) in crystallographic Laue condition
- **Solution**: Implemented pure crystallographic convention matching nanoBragg.c
- **Result**: Discrete Bragg peaks now appear at correct reciprocal space positions

### **Correct Physics Implementation**
```python
# Crystallographic scattering vector (nanoBragg.c convention)
scattering_vector = (diffracted_beam_unit - incident_beam_unit) / self.wavelength

# Crystallographic Laue condition: h = S¬∑a
h = dot_product(scattering_vector, self.crystal.a.view(1, 1, 3))
k = dot_product(scattering_vector, self.crystal.b.view(1, 1, 3))
l = dot_product(scattering_vector, self.crystal.c.view(1, 1, 3))
```
