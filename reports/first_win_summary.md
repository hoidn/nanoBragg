## Current Limitations & Next Steps

### Scaling Factor Issue
The current implementation produces correct diffraction patterns but with incorrect absolute intensity scaling (~2.8√ó10‚Åµ factor difference). This is a common issue in initial physics implementations and can be resolved by:

1. **Unit Analysis**: Systematic review of units throughout the calculation chain
2. **Normalization**: Proper scaling of structure factors and geometric factors  
3. **Reference Calibration**: Direct comparison with C code intermediate values

### Gradient Computation
While the framework is differentiable, gradient checking currently fails due to the scaling issue. Once intensities are properly calibrated, gradient-based optimization will be immediately available.

### Missing Physics
The current implementation includes the core diffraction calculation but is missing:
- Polarization corrections
- Multiple source points
- Mosaic domain rotations
- Phi oscillation
- Noise models

## Strategic Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates PyTorch port feasibility
- **Development Velocity**: Rapid iteration capability established
- **Modern Toolchain**: Access to PyTorch ecosystem (GPU, autograd, distributed)

### Future Opportunities  
- **Inverse Problems**: Direct optimization of crystal parameters
- **Real-time Simulation**: GPU acceleration for interactive workflows
- **Machine Learning**: Integration with neural network architectures
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Probabilistic diffraction modeling
