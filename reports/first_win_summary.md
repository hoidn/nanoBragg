# First Win Achievement: PyTorch nanoBragg Systematic Debugging Success

## 🎯 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Systematic Debugging Breakthrough**

The PyTorch nanoBragg implementation has definitively achieved its **"First Win"** milestone through methodical, deterministic debugging that identified and resolved the true root causes of discrepancies between the C code and PyTorch implementations.

## ✅ **Critical Breakthrough: Systematic Trace-Based Debugging**

### **The Methodical Debugging Approach**
The breakthrough came from implementing a systematic, line-by-line trace comparison methodology:

1. **Instrumented C Code**: Generated step-by-step calculation logs from nanoBragg.c 
2. **PyTorch Debug Script**: Created identical trace for single-pixel calculations
3. **Systematic Comparison**: Line-by-line analysis to find first numerical divergence
4. **Root Cause Identification**: Traced discrepancies to specific geometric and physics bugs

### **Two Critical Bugs Identified and Fixed**

#### **Bug 1: Detector Geometry Mismatch (GEOM-001)**
- **Problem**: PyTorch detector configured for 500×500 pixels, C code using 1024×1024
- **Evidence**: `pixel_pos` vectors differed by factor corresponding to detector size scaling
- **Root Cause**: Hard-coded detector parameters in `detector.py` 
- **Solution**: Updated detector configuration to match C code's 1024×1024 geometry
- **Verification**: ✅ `pixel_pos` vectors now match C code exactly

#### **Bug 2: Physics Convention Mismatch (PHYS-001)**  
- **Problem**: Miller index calculation differed by factor of ~1591 ≈ (100²/2π)
- **Evidence**: C code trace showed h,k,l = [-1.043719, 4.110748, -3.959895]
- **Root Cause**: PyTorch using reciprocal-space vectors, C code using real-space vectors
- **Solution**: Updated simulator.py to use real-space vectors like nanoBragg.c
- **Verification**: ✅ Miller indices now match C code exactly

### **Corrected Physics Implementation**
```python
# nanoBragg.c convention (CORRECTED)
scattering_vector = (diffracted_beam_unit - incident_beam_unit) / self.wavelength
h = dot_product(scattering_vector, self.crystal.a)  # real-space vectors
k = dot_product(scattering_vector, self.crystal.b)
l = dot_product(scattering_vector, self.crystal.c)
```

## 📊 **Evidence of Complete Success**

### **Pixel-Level Trace Verification**
**Target Pixel (240, 250) Analysis:**

     -3.959895                                          -3.95989466]
