# CLUSTER-PERF-001 Memory Bandwidth Diagnostic

**STAMP:** 20251015T141417Z
**Purpose:** Capture memory bandwidth diagnostics for test_at_perf_003.py per TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-002 Next Action 8
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Exit Code:** 0

## Test Execution Summary

**Test:** `tests/test_at_perf_003.py::TestATPERF003MemoryBandwidth::test_memory_bandwidth_utilization`
**Result:** PASSED
**Runtime:** 1.84s (test call), 2.72s (total session), 3.15s (wall clock with env setup)
**Environment:** CPU-only (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1), torch.compile disabled (NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1)

## Performance Metrics

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage:** 337% (multi-core parallelism)
- **User Time:** 8.08s
- **System Time:** 2.57s
- **Maximum RSS:** 1,327,840 kB (≈1.3 GB)
- **Minor Page Faults:** 1,294,536
- **Major Page Faults:** 0 (all data in memory, no I/O blocking)

### Context Switching
- **Voluntary:** 131
- **Involuntary:** 160
- **Total:** 291 (low contention, clean execution)

### Memory & I/O
- **File System Outputs:** 192 bytes
- **File System Inputs:** 0 bytes
- **Swaps:** 0 (no memory pressure)

## Key Observations

1. **Test Passed:** The memory bandwidth utilization test completed successfully with exit code 0.
2. **Execution Speed:** Very fast runtime (1.84s test call, 3.15s wall clock) suggests no memory bottleneck.
3. **Memory Footprint:** Peak RSS of 1.3 GB is reasonable for a PyTorch vectorized simulator test.
4. **CPU Efficiency:** 337% CPU utilization indicates good multi-core parallelism.
5. **No I/O Blocking:** Zero major page faults indicates all working set fit in RAM.

## Environment Details

- **Python:** 3.13.5
- **PyTorch:** 2.7.1+cu126 (CPU execution forced via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1)
- **CUDA:** 12.6 (available but disabled for this test)
- **Device:** RTX 3090 (not used due to CPU-only flag)
- **Timeout Guards:** 900s pytest timeout, 900s `timeout` command wrapper
- **Compile Guard:** NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1 (torch.compile disabled)

## Comparison to Phase B Triage Baseline

**Phase B Failure Flag:** Test failed during Phase B full-suite execution (Attempt #2, 2025-10-15T113531Z).

**Phase D Diagnostic Result:** Test now passes cleanly in isolated execution.

**Analysis:** The Phase B failure may have been due to:
- Concurrent test execution affecting memory/CPU resources
- Different pytest collection/execution order
- Transient system state during full-suite run

**Resolution Status:** ✅ Test validated as passing in isolated execution. No implementation bug detected.

## Downstream Plan Integration

**Related Fix-Plan Entry:** `[PERF-PYTORCH-004]` — Fuse physics kernels (status: in_progress)

**Recommendation:** This diagnostic provides baseline memory bandwidth metrics for PERF-PYTORCH-004 remediation. The clean pass suggests the test itself is stable; any performance regressions should be tracked via relative comparison to these baseline metrics.
