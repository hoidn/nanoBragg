# Phase I Gradient Timeout Decision Memo

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**STAMP:** 20251015T173309Z
**Test:** `tests/test_gradients.py::TestPropertyBasedGradients::test_property_gradient_stability`
**Environment:** CPU-only (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1`), compile guard enabled (`NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1`)

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** ✅ **RETAIN current 905s timeout** - no adjustment needed.

The isolated gradient test completed in **846.13s** (14m 06s), leaving a **6.5% safety margin** below the 905s ceiling established in Phase R. This confirms the timeout is appropriately sized for worst-case gradient computation.

## Runtime Measurements

### Pytest Timing
- **Call time:** 845.29s (pure test execution)
- **Total time:** 846.13s (including setup/teardown)
- **Exit code:** 0 (PASS)

### System Resources (from `/usr/bin/time -v`)
```
User time (seconds): 5153.23
System time (seconds): 5801.29
Percent of CPU this job got: 1293%
Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 14:06.68
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 8801020
```

### Analysis
- **CPU utilization:** 1293% (excellent parallelization across ~13 cores)
- **Memory:** 8.8 GB peak RSS (no memory pressure)
- **Wall clock:** 846.68s (aligns with pytest duration)
- **Margin vs 905s timeout:** 58.32s (6.5% headroom)

## Historical Context

| Phase | Date | Runtime | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| Phase F | 2025-10-15 | 844.15s | Isolated baseline, established <900s expectation |
| Phase O | 2025-10-15 | 845.68s | Validated stability |
| Phase P | 2025-10-15 | — | Established 900s ceiling with 6% margin |
| Phase Q | 2025-10-15 | 839.14s | Confirmed under 900s |
| Phase R | 2025-10-15 | 900.02s | Chunk 03 breach → raised ceiling to 905s (0.5% margin) |
| **Phase I** | **2025-10-15** | **846.13s** | **6.5% margin validates 905s ceiling** |

## Variance Analysis

Phase I runtime (846.13s) aligns closely with Phase F baseline (844.15s), showing only **1.98s drift** (+0.2%). This indicates:

1. **Stable computational load:** No algorithmic regressions since Phase F
2. **Consistent system performance:** CPU throttling not a factor
3. **Appropriate ceiling:** 905s timeout provides adequate buffer for system variance

## System Load Snapshot

See `env/system_load.txt` for detailed CPU/thermal diagnostics. No throttling or resource contention detected during this run.

## Decision Rationale

**Why retain 905s timeout:**
1. **Safety margin:** 6.5% headroom accommodates system variability
2. **Historical stability:** Runtime consistently 839-846s across Phase F/O/Q/I
3. **No timeout failures:** Phase G timeout was during full-suite concurrent load, not isolated execution
4. **Spec compliance:** Aligns with `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §4.1 expectations

**Why not reduce timeout:**
- Phase R chunk 03 observed 900.02s under full-suite load conditions
- 905s provides minimal but necessary buffer for concurrent test execution
- Reducing timeout risks spurious failures during CI parallel runs

**Why not increase timeout:**
- No evidence of legitimate >846s runtimes in isolation
- Current ceiling already provides 58s margin above observed peak
- Excessive timeout delays CI feedback on genuine hangs

## Implementation Notes

- Current timeout configured via `@pytest.mark.timeout(905)` in `tests/test_gradients.py`
- Requires `pytest-timeout` package (included in `pip install -e ".[test]"`)
- Environment guard `NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1` remains mandatory per `arch.md` §15

## Next Actions

1. ✅ **Close Phase I with confidence** - 905s timeout validated
2. **Monitor Phase K full-suite run** - confirm timeout holds under concurrent load
3. **No code changes required** - existing timeout policy is correct
4. **Update fix_plan** - log Phase I completion with this memo as evidence
