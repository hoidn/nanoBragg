✓ Guard elements verified in loop.sh:
  - timeout 30 git pull --rebase (line 10)
  - Single execution of prompts/debug.md (line 23)
  - Conditional push logic (lines 26-34)

✓ Dry-run behavior: Script attempted pull rebase (expected to warn on unstaged changes), would execute debug.md once, conditional push present
