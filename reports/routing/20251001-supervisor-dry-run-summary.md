# Supervisor.sh Guarded Dry Run Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Test Command:** `export CODEX_CMD="printf" && bash ./supervisor.sh`
**Plan Reference:** plans/active/supervisor-loop-guard/plan.md Phase B3

## Test Results

### 1. Pull Guard Behavior ✅
```
error: cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes.
error: Please commit or stash them.
WARNING: git pull --rebase failed or timed out. Proceeding with local state.
```

**Result:** PASS - The timeouted pull guard correctly:
- Attempted `timeout 30 git pull --rebase`
- Detected failure (unstaged changes in this case)
- Printed appropriate WARNING
- Continued with local state instead of hanging

### 2. Single Iteration Execution ✅
The script no longer contains a for-loop. It executes the supervisor prompt exactly once per invocation:
```bash
${CODEX_CMD} exec -m gpt-5-codex -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox < prompts/supervisor.md | tee -a "${LOG_FILE}"
SUPERVISOR_EXIT=$?
```

**Result:** PASS - Single execution enforced (external orchestration controls repetition)

### 3. Conditional Push Logic ✅
The script implements the conditional push guard:
```bash
if [ $SUPERVISOR_EXIT -eq 0 ]; then
  if git diff --quiet origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)..HEAD 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "No new commits to push."
  else
    echo "Pushing commits to remote..."
    git push || {
      echo "WARNING: git push failed. Please push manually."
      exit 1
    }
  fi
else
  echo "WARNING: Supervisor execution failed (exit code: $SUPERVISOR_EXIT). Skipping push."
  exit $SUPERVISOR_EXIT
fi
```

**Result:** PASS - Push only occurs when:
- Execution succeeded (SUPERVISOR_EXIT=0)
- There are commits to push
- Push failure is handled gracefully

### 4. Conda Environment Activation ✅
```bash
# --- Activate the conda environment required for supervisor automation ---
source "$(conda info --base)/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
conda activate pytorch
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Result:** PASS - Environment activated before execution

## Overall Assessment

All four guard elements successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Timeouted pull with fallback logic
2. ✅ Single-iteration execution
3. ✅ Conditional push guard
4. ✅ Conda environment activation

The script mirrors the `loop.sh` guard logic (commit 853cf08) and is ready for Phase B4 hygiene verification.

## Notes

- Dry run used `CODEX_CMD="printf"` to prevent actual API calls
- The pull guard correctly handled unstaged changes scenario
- The fallback logic is in place for timeout/rebase-in-progress scenarios
- No unexpected behavior observed
