# Phase B1 Profiler Capture - BLOCKED

**Date:** 2025-12-22  
**Commit:** ac94e90c83cb13cb11377c1b1b022b35a54c9fa2  
**Branch:** feature/spec-based-2  
**Status:** ❌ BLOCKED - Correlation threshold not met

## Executive Summary

Phase B1 profiler capture attempted but **BLOCKED** due to critical parity regression. PyTorch vs C correlation is **0.721175**, far below the required ≥0.99 threshold documented in the plan and input.md.

## Metrics

- **Correlation (warm):** 0.721175 ❌ (required: ≥0.99)
- **PyTorch warm time:** 0.639s
- **C time:** 0.534s  
- **Speedup (warm):** 0.79× (PyTorch 1.27× slower)
- **Cache setup speedup:** 73,572.8× ✓

## Blocking Issue

The low correlation (0.72) indicates a significant numerical difference between C and PyTorch implementations. This violates the fundamental parity requirement and makes profiler-based loop prioritization unreliable.

Possible causes:
1. Recent code changes broke parity (check commits since last known-good correlation)
2. Source-weight normalization regression (SOURCE-WEIGHT-001 reopened?)
3. Tricubic interpolation issue (VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001 Phase H regression?)
4. RNG seed mismatch
5. Detector geometry drift

## Artifacts

- `profile/benchmark_results.json` - Full benchmark metrics
- `profile/trace.json` - PyTorch profiler trace (unreliable until parity fixed)
- `correlation.txt` - Blocking status record
- `env.json` - Environment metadata
- `torch_env.txt` - Detailed PyTorch environment
- `pytest_collect.log` - Test collection baseline (694 lines, exit 0)

## Next Actions (BLOCKING)

Per input.md guidance: "If Blocked: Capture the failing stdout/stderr into reports/2026-01-vectorization-gap/phase_b/<STAMP>/blocking.md, note the exit code in commands.txt, and append a docs/fix_plan.md attempt describing the failure mode before stopping."

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Append attempt to docs/fix_plan.md [VECTOR-GAPS-002] with correlation=0.721175 blocker
2. **DEBUG:** Run AT-PARALLEL-012 and recent parity tests to identify regression scope
3. **TRACE:** Execute parallel trace comparison per docs/debugging/debugging.md SOP
4. **REOPEN:** Mark [VECTOR-GAPS-002] Phase B1 as [B] (blocked) and Phase B2/B3 cannot proceed
5. **SUPERVISOR:** Hand off to galph for triage - likely need to reopen SOURCE-WEIGHT-001 or VECTOR-TRICUBIC-001

## Do Not Proceed

Phase B2 (correlate loops with trace) and B3 (prioritized backlog) are blocked until correlation ≥0.99. Profiler hotspot data is unreliable when numeric outputs diverge this significantly.
