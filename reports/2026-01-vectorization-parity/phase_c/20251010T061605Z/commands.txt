# Task: Manual trace comparison for pixels (2048,2048), (1792,2048), (4095,2048)

# Environment setup
export STAMP=20251010T061605Z
mkdir -p reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/$STAMP/env

# C traces (Phase C1) — previously captured
# Source: reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T053711Z/c_traces/

# PyTorch traces (Phase C2) — previously captured
# Source: reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T055346Z/py_traces/

# Analysis performed via manual file reads and line-by-line comparison
# Tools used: Read tool (Claude Code), manual diff inspection

# Key comparisons (sample):
# diff -u reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T053711Z/c_traces/pixel_2048_2048.log \
#          reports/2026-01-vectorization-parity/phase_c/20251010T055346Z/py_traces/pixel_2048_2048.log

# Output artifacts
