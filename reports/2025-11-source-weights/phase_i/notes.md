# Phase I3 Archive Packet — SOURCE-WEIGHT-001 Closure

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**STAMP:** 20251010T012205Z
**Mode:** Docs
**Loop:** ralph #270

## Objective
Complete Phase I3 per `plans/active/source-weight-normalization.md:57` by assembling the archive packet, moving the active plan to archive, and flipping the ledger entry to `done`.

## Actions Taken

1. **Created archive summary:** `plans/archive/source-weight-normalization.md`
   - Comprehensive initiative summary covering all phases (A through I3)
   - Final parity metrics: correlation=0.9999886, sum_ratio=1.0038 (both within spec thresholds)
   - Residual risks documented (C comment parsing bug, tricubic segfault guardrails)
   - Cross-references to spec, architecture docs, parity memo, and dependent plans

2. **Updated ledger entry:** `docs/fix_plan.md` `[SOURCE-WEIGHT-001]`
   - Status changed from `in_progress` to `done`
   - Attempt #40 logged with archive packet paths
   - Parity memo and thresholds preserved in ledger for future reference

3. **Removed active plan:** `plans/active/source-weight-normalization.md`
   - Content superseded by archive document
   - All phase guidance now in archive for provenance

4. **Pytest collection validation:** 692 tests collected successfully (exit 0)
   - Confirms documentation changes did not break test discovery
   - Log saved to `collect.log` in this STAMP directory

## Artifacts
- Archive summary: `plans/archive/source-weight-normalization.md`
- Command log: `reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_i/20251010T012205Z/commands.txt`
- Notes (this file): `reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_i/20251010T012205Z/notes.md`
- Test collection log: `reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_i/20251010T012205Z/collect.log`

## Normative Parity Thresholds (Preserved)
Per `reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_h/20251010T002324Z/parity_reassessment.md`:
- Correlation: ≥0.999
- Sum Ratio: |sum_ratio−1| ≤5e-3

## Residual Risks (Cross-Linked)
1. **[C-SOURCEFILE-001]:** C comment parsing bug → use comment-free fixtures
2. **Tricubic segfault:** Pass `-nointerpolate` when no HKL data present

## Dependent Plans Unblocked (Phase I2)
- `plans/active/vectorization.md` (Phase A2)
- `plans/active/vectorization-gap-audit.md` (Phase B1)
- `docs/fix_plan.md` entries: VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002, VECTOR-GAPS-002, PERF-PYTORCH-004

## Next Action (Supervisor)
Append archival decision to `galph_memory.md` noting:
- Archive location: `plans/archive/source-weight-normalization.md`
- Final parity: corr=0.9999886, sum_ratio=1.0038
- Remaining dependency: [C-SOURCEFILE-001] for complete C bug resolution
- Readiness for Phase A3 prep of VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002

## Exit Criteria ✅
- [x] Archive summary drafted with phase highlights and residual risks
- [x] Ledger entry flipped to `done`
- [x] Active plan file removed
- [x] Test collection stable (692 tests)
- [x] Artifacts stored under STAMP directory
- [x] galph_memory handoff noted
