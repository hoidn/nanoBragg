# SOURCE-WEIGHT-001 Phase I1: Documentation Updates
**Date:** 2025-10-10T00:57:17Z
**Ralph Loop:** #269
**Mode:** Docs (per input.md)
**Branch:** feature/spec-based-2
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Executive Summary

Phase I1 documentation updates complete. Updated three key documentation files to reference the Phase H parity reassessment memo (`reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_h/20251010T002324Z/parity_reassessment.md`) and encode the validated thresholds (correlation ≥0.999, |sum_ratio−1| ≤5e-3).

**Validation:** `pytest --collect-only -q` passed with 692 tests collected, no errors.

---

## Files Updated

### 1. docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md

**Added:** New subsection §1.1.5 "Source Weighting & Integration (C-Parity Confirmed)"

**Content:** 24 lines documenting:
- Equal weighting normative requirement from `specs/spec-a-core.md:151-153`
- C-code reference (`nanoBragg.c:2570-2720`)
- Phase H parity memo citation with thresholds
- Implementation details (guard at simulator.py:399-423, normalization at line 1892)
- Data flow explanation
- Known C defect cross-reference (`[C-SOURCEFILE-001]`)
- Acceptance test reference (AT-SRC-001)

**Rationale:** Provides permanent architecture documentation for equal weighting decision, replacing legacy divergence classification with validated parity evidence.

---

### 2. docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md

**Added:** New item #4 "Source Handling & Equal Weighting (C-Parity)"

**Content:** 6 lines documenting:
- Prohibition against applying weight column as multiplicative factor
- Steps normalization formula citing source count
- CLI `-lambda` authoritative behavior
- Phase H memo reference with thresholds
- Test selector for validation

**Renumbered:** Previous item #4 "Documentation & Tests" became item #5

**Rationale:** Adds actionable guardrail to prevent future weight-handling regressions during simulator edits.

---

### 3. specs/spec-a-core.md

**Modified:** Lines 151-155 (Sources, Divergence & Dispersion section)

**Change:** Added 3-line parenthetical citation after existing normative text:

```
(C-PyTorch parity validated: correlation ≥0.999, |sum_ratio−1| ≤5e-3; see 
reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_h/20251010T002324Z/parity_reassessment.md 
for C reference code inspection.)
```

**Rationale:** Spec already contained correct normative language ("weight column and wavelength column are read but ignored"); parenthetical adds empirical validation evidence without altering contract.

---

## Validation Results

**Command:** `NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q`

**Output:** 692 tests collected successfully (see `collect.log`)

**Exit Status:** 0 (success)

**Interpretation:** All test imports and collection logic remain valid after documentation updates. No code changes introduced; documentation edits do not affect test execution.

## Phase I1 Exit Criteria

Per `plans/active/source-weight-normalization.md` Phase I1 task:

- [x] Updated `docs/architecture/pytorch_design.md` with sources subsection citing Phase H memo
- [x] Updated `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` with sourcefile handling guardrail
- [x] Inspected `specs/spec-a-core.md` §4; added parenthetical parity reference (language already matched)
- [x] Captured edits under timestamped directory with commands.txt and diffs
- [x] Ran `NB_RUN_PARALLEL=1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q` (passed)

**Status:** Phase I1 COMPLETE

---

## Next Actions (Phase I2-I3)

**Phase I2:** Refresh dependent plans/ledgers
- Update `plans/active/vectorization.md` status snapshot
- Update `docs/fix_plan.md` entries (`VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002`, `VECTOR-GAPS-002`, `PERF-PYTORCH-004`)
- Ensure all references cite Phase H memo instead of legacy divergence thresholds

**Phase I3:** Archive initiative
- Draft closure summary for `plans/archive/source-weight-normalization.md`
- Update `[SOURCE-WEIGHT-001]` status to `done` in `docs/fix_plan.md`
- Record final galph_memory entry with residual risks note
