# Phase D2 Commands Log
# Generated: 2025-10-09T10:32:12Z
# Purpose: Document all commands executed during Phase D2 design loop

# Step 1: Create timestamped artifact directory
mkdir -p reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_d/20251009T103212Z

# Step 2: Run pytest collection to prove repository state
KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q 2>&1 | tee reports/2025-11-source-weights/phase_d/20251009T103212Z/pytest_collect.log

# Step 3: Generate design_notes.md (artifact creation via Write tool)
# Manual: Created design_notes.md synthesizing Phase D1 findings into Option B recommendation

# Step 4: Create this commands log
# Manual: Documenting commands for reproduction

# Expected Outputs:
# - design_notes.md: Design decision document with Option B recommendation
# - pytest_collect.log: Collection proof (682 tests discovered)
# - commands.txt: This file
# - summary.md: Short framing of next steps for Phase D3

# Phase D3 Prerequisites (next loop):
# 1. Read and approve design_notes.md recommendation
# 2. Define pytest selector for TC-D1/D2/D3/D4 acceptance harness
# 3. Draft CLI command bundle with explicit -oversample 1 and sourcefile
# 4. Capture expected correlation ≥0.999, |sum_ratio-1| ≤1e-3 thresholds in harness notes
