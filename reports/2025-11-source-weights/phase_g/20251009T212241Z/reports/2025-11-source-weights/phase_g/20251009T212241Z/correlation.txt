corr=n/a (C binary not available)

PyTorch vs C correlation could not be computed because C binary was not found.
Checked locations:
- ./golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg
- ./nanoBragg

This is expected in environments where the C reference has not been compiled.
PyTorch spec-compliance is validated by the test suite (see pytest.log).
