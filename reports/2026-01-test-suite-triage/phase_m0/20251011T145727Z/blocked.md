# Phase M0 Full Suite Run — BLOCKED (Timeout)

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-11T14:57:27Z
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED (system timeout before completion)
**Cause:** 360s (6-minute) system timeout limit insufficient for full suite execution

## Issue Summary

Two separate full-suite execution attempts (using `timeout 3600` wrapper) were both terminated by the system-level 360-second timeout before test execution could complete. Tests reached approximately 75% completion (~510/687 tests) before termination.

**Root Causes:**
1. **System timeout override:** The Bash tool's 6-minute system-level timeout (360,000ms) terminates commands regardless of internal `timeout` wrapper settings
2. **Insufficient runtime budget:** Prior Phase H/K runs required ~1860s (~31 minutes); 360s is only 19% of required time

## Observations

**Last visible progress before timeout:**
- Collection: 687 tests (1 skipped during collection)
- Last test: `test_gradients.py::TestCellParameterGradients::test_gradcheck_cell_b` (75% mark)
- All tests passing up to termination point

**Environment verified:**
- Python 3.13.5
- PyTorch 2.7.1+cu126
- CUDA 12.6 available (tests run with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` per directive)
- 237 packages in pip freeze

**Artifacts captured before timeout:**
- `preflight/env.txt` — runtime environment snapshot ✅
- `preflight/pip_freeze.txt` — 237 package versions ✅
- `preflight/collect_only.log` — NOT CAPTURED (path construction error, double slash)
- `artifacts/pytest_full.log` — INCOMPLETE (~510/687 tests, truncated at timeout)
- `artifacts/pytest_full.xml` — INCOMPLETE or missing (junit output may not have flushed)

## Path Construction Bug

Similar to Phase K Attempt #14, path variables contain double slashes (e.g., `phase_m0//preflight/`) preventing log capture via `tee`. This error pattern:
```
tee: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m0//preflight/collect_only.log: No such file or directory
```

**Root cause:** STAMP variable not being set correctly in multi-step bash chains with command substitution.

## Comparison to Prior Phases

| Phase | Runtime | Tests | Pass | Fail | Skip | Exit | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| H (Attempt #10) | 1867s | 683 | 504 | 36 | 143 | 0 | Complete |
| K (Attempt #15) | 1841s | 687 | 512 | 31 | 143 | 0 | Complete |
| **M0 (this attempt)** | **~360s** | **~510** | **?** | **?** | **?** | **timeout** | **INCOMPLETE** |

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Retry with corrected approach per Phase K Attempt #15 pattern:
   - Pre-create timestamp variable and export: `STAMP=20251011T145727Z`
   - Use explicit paths without command substitution in critical sections
   - Invoke pytest directly with pre-resolved paths
   - Allow full 60-minute runtime via external timeout wrapper OR acknowledge system timeout limitation

2. **Alternative (if system timeout cannot be extended):**
   - Use Phase K data (31 failures, 687 tests, 20251011T072940Z) as the "most recent complete baseline"
   - Document that Phase M0 attempted but blocked; proceed with M0c triage using Phase K outputs
   - Add Phase M0 retry to fix_plan as deferred/blocked item

## Next Steps

Per input.md §If Blocked:
> Stop after logging the failure in `reports/.../blocked.md` and update docs/fix_plan.md + plans/active/test-suite-triage.md (Phase M0 table) with the observed blocker.

**Action:** Update fix_plan.md Attempts History with this blockage and await supervisor guidance on whether to:
- (A) Retry M0 with extended timeout/corrected invocation
- (B) Use Phase K baseline as current state and skip M0
- (C) Other approach
