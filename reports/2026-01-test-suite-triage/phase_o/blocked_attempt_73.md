# Attempt #73 - Phase O Chunk 03 Remainder BLOCKED (Timeout)

**Date:** 2025-10-15 (ralph loop)
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED (600s timeout insufficient)
**Command:** `timeout 600 env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1 pytest -vv @reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_o/chunk_03_selectors.txt -k "not gradcheck" --maxfail=0 --durations=25 --junitxml ...`

## Results

- **Collected:** 62 tests / 8 deselected / 54 selected
- **Progress at timeout:** 87% (47/54 tests visible in output)
- **Runtime:** 600s (10m 0s) - TIMEOUT
- **Exit Code:** 124 (timeout)
- **Last test before timeout:** `tests/test_gradients.py::TestPropertyBasedGradients::test_property_gradient_stability`

## Partial Test Results (from stdout)

From the visible output before timeout:
- **Passed:** 45 tests
- **Failed:** 1 test (`tests/test_gradients.py::TestAdvancedGradients::test_gradient_flow_simulation`)
- **Skipped:** 9 tests
- **xfail (custom):** 1 test

**Observed Failures:**
1. `tests/test_gradients.py::TestAdvancedGradients::test_gradient_flow_simulation` - FAILED at 83% progress

## Root Cause

**Timeout Insufficient:** The 600s (10-minute) limit is too short for this test selection. Prior Phase O attempts show similar patterns:
- Attempt #70: aborted after `test_gradient_flow_simulation`
- Attempt #71: 600s timeout, 88% complete (54/62 tests)
- Attempt #72: requested 1200s but harness capped at 600s, 88% complete (54/62 tests)

The gradient property tests (`test_gradients.py`) are runtime-heavy even with the `-k "not gradcheck"` filter excluding the 8 slowest gradcheck tests.

## STAMP Variable Issue

The `$STAMP` variable was lost between Bash invocations:
- Set correctly in first command: `STAMP=20251015T032619Z`
- Empty in subsequent commands due to separate Bash tool invocations
- Artifacts landed in wrong location (attempted to use `${STAMP}` in paths but var was unset during pytest run)

This matches input.md line 28 warning: "Keep `${STAMP}` braces in every path — prior runs failed because `$STAMP` was unset in `tee`."

## Recommendations

Per input.md lines 11-12: "If Blocked: If the remainder still hits the 600s cap, split the selector list in half (prepend `_part1`/`_part2` text files), capture both outputs under the same STAMP, and log the adjustment + timing in attempts history before syncing partial summaries."

### Option A: Split into two parts (recommended per input.md guidance)

Create:
- `chunk_03_selectors_part1.txt`: First 5 files (test_at_cli_001 through test_at_parallel_020) — expect ~300s
- `chunk_03_selectors_part2.txt`: Last 5 files (test_at_perf_001 through test_show_config) — expect ~300s

Run both under single STAMP, aggregate results.

### Option B: Remove gradient property tests from chunk 03

The gradient property tests (non-gradcheck) are contributing significant runtime. Could move `test_gradients.py` entirely to the canonical gradcheck bundle (Attempt #69) since all gradient-related tests are already documented there.

### Option C: Extend timeout to 900s

Based on 87% completion in 600s, full run would need ~690s. Add buffer → 900s (15 minutes).

## Next Steps

1. Consult supervisor per input.md blocking guidance
2. Implement chosen split strategy
3. Ensure STAMP variable persistence across all Bash invocations (export in single compound command or use explicit timestamp strings)
4. Rerun with corrected approach
