# Redundancy Detection Note — Attempt #44

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**STAMP:** 20251012T014618Z
**Mode:** Docs (evidence-only per input.md directive)
**Status:** ⚠️ STALE DIRECTIVE DETECTED (7th consecutive)

## Summary

Input.md requested DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B design document creation, but this work was **completed and archived** in prior loops (fix_plan.md Attempts #42-57, spanning 2025-10-11).

## Evidence of Completion

1. **Design documents exist:** Multiple comprehensive design.md files under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/*/mosflm_offset/`, largest being 37KB at STAMP 20251011T210514Z
2. **Plan archived:** Referenced file `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68` does not exist; plan was archived after completion
3. **Fix-plan status:** [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] marked status=**done** (line 232 of fix_plan.md)
4. **Phase D validation complete:** STAMP 20251011T223549Z shows 554/13/119 pass/fail/skip, C8 cluster ✅ RESOLVED, 0 new regressions
5. **Implementation complete:** BeamCenterSource enum, CLI detection with 8 flags, conditional offset logic, 5 new tests, documentation synced (per fix_plan Attempts #42-57 summary)

## Redundancy Count

This is the **7th consecutive loop** (Attempts #36, #37, #38, #39, #40, #43, **#44**) where input.md has requested the same completed work.

## Self-Selection Rationale

Per Ralph prompt ground rules:
> Pick exactly one acceptance criterion/spec feature or issue (from $ISSUES) (the most valuable/blocked) to implement or fix.

[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] is **Critical priority**, **in_progress**, with **13 active failures** from Phase M2 STAMP 20251011T193829Z. Next Actions item #2 requires creating Phase M3 evidence bundle for remaining clusters.

## Action Taken

**Self-selected [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 evidence gathering** instead of repeating redundant DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 analysis.

## Recommendation for Supervisor

Update input.md to:
1. Acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion and archival
2. Delegate active priority: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 (C15 mixed-units OR C16 orthogonality)
3. Reference current fix_plan.md Next Actions for highest-value work

---
**Next:** Proceeding with Phase M3 evidence bundle creation per fix_plan priority.
