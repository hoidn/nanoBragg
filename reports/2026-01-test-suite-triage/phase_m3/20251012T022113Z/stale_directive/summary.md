# Stale Directive Detection: DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Already Complete

**STAMP:** 20251012T022113Z
**Loop:** Ralph Attempt (consecutive redundancy detection)
**Mode:** Docs (Evidence Parameter Validation per step -1)
**Directive:** input.md requesting Phase B design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** Input.md directive is **STALE and REDUNDANT** — all requested work has already been completed and archived.

**Evidence:**
1. **Plan file missing:** `plans/active/detector-config.md` does not exist (input.md line 29 reference is broken)
2. **Plan archived:** `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` exists with completion date 2025-10-11
3. **Multiple design documents exist:** 5+ design artifacts found in phase_m3 spanning STAMPs 20251011T201712Z through 20251011T214422Z
4. **Fix_plan status:** [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] marked `done (archived)` on line 232 of docs/fix_plan.md
5. **Cluster C8 resolved:** Summary document shows "✅ RESOLVED (Phase M3 complete)" at line 257

## Requested Work vs Actual State

### Input.md Request
```
Do Now: Draft the Option A remediation design under reports/.../mosflm_offset/design.md
  (plan Phase B tasks B1–B4).
Pointers: plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68
```

### Actual State

**Plan Status:**
- ❌ `plans/active/detector-config.md` — Does not exist (referenced file is missing)
- ✅ `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` — Archived after completion

**Design Documents Already Exist:**
```
reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/
  20251011T201712Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (31KB)
  20251011T203303Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (21KB)
  20251011T203822Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (28KB)
  20251011T210514Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (37KB)
  20251011T212123Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (25KB)
  20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (23KB - MOST COMPREHENSIVE)
```

**Implementation Complete:**
- Phase B (Design): Exit criteria B1-B4 complete per archived plan
- Phase C (Implementation): BeamCenterSource enum, CLI detection, conditional offset, 5 new tests
- Phase D (Validation): Full-suite rerun (554/13/119), C8 cluster RESOLVED, no regressions

**Test Results:**
- ✅ `test_at_parallel_003.py::test_detector_offset_preservation` PASSES
- ✅ All detector config tests passing (16/16 in targeted run per fix_plan Attempt #17)
- ✅ Full-suite validation confirmed no regressions (Phase D STAMP 20251011T223549Z)

## Most Comprehensive Design Artifact

**Location:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md`

**Size:** 23KB (583+ lines)

**Contents:** 11 major sections covering:
1. Executive Summary (Option A recommendation)
2. Problem Statement (spec-a-core.md §72, arch.md §ADR-03 references)
3. Root Cause Analysis (detector.py beam center conversion code paths)
4. Design Options Comparison (Option A vs Option B with trade-offs)
5. Detailed Implementation Plan (BeamCenterSource enum, CLI detection, conditional offset)
6. Test Coverage Strategy (5 new test cases, parity validation)
7. CLI Flag Detection Logic (8 explicit flags mapped)
8. Risk Assessment (API-002, CONVENTION-001 interactions)
9. Documentation Touch Points (detector.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md, findings.md)
10. Exit Criteria (B1-B4 checklist)
11. Implementation Phases (B→C→D progression)

**All Phase B Exit Criteria Met:**
- B1: Conversion site confirmed (detector.py:78-142)
- B2: Offset formula documented with device/dtype discipline
- B3: Validation plan specified (targeted + module + cluster selectors)
- B4: Regression test spec with pytest selectors

## Root Cause of Stale Directive

**Timeline:**
1. 2025-10-11: DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phases B-C-D completed successfully
2. 2025-10-11: Plan archived to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`
3. 2025-10-11: Fix_plan.md updated with status=`done (archived)`
4. 2025-10-12 (now): input.md still references missing `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68`

**Issue:** Supervisor (galph) did not update input.md after plan archival, causing repeated redundant requests.

## Consecutive Redundancy Count

This is the **8th consecutive loop** detecting the same stale DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 directive:
- Attempt #36 (20251011T233622Z)
- Attempt #37 (20251011T234401Z)
- Attempt #38 (20251011T234802Z)
- Attempt #39 (20251012T004433Z)
- Attempt #40 (20251012T010425Z)
- Attempt #41 (20251012T012246Z)
- Attempt #42 (20251012T013323Z)
- **Current:** (20251012T022113Z)

Each attempt has documented the same evidence and recommendations without supervisor response.

## Active Priorities (Per Fix_plan.md Current State)

**Critical Priority:**
- **[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]** (Status: in_progress, Critical)
  - Phase M2 baseline: 13 failures remaining (down from 46 in Phase M0)
  - Active clusters requiring attention:
    - **C2:** Gradient compile guard (10 failures, workaround documented in arch.md §15)
    - **C15:** Mixed-units zero intensity bug (1 failure, physics issue, needs callchain analysis)
    - **C16:** Orthogonality tolerance (1 failure, **RESOLVED in Attempt #43**)
    - **C17:** Polarization edge cases (2 failures, needs investigation)
    - **C18:** Performance regression (1 failure, needs profiling)

**High Priority:**
- **[VECTOR-PARITY-001]** (Status: in_progress, blocked on suite health)
- **[SOURCE-WEIGHT-002]** (Status: done per Attempt #15)

## Recommendation to Supervisor

### Immediate Action Required

**Update input.md to acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion:**

```markdown
# DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Status Update (2025-10-11)

DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 has been successfully completed and archived. All phases (B-D)
complete with C8 cluster resolved. Plan archived at
plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md.

Evidence bundles:
- Design: reports/.../phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md
- Implementation: reports/.../phase_m3/20251011T213351Z/mosflm_fix/summary.md
- Validation: reports/.../phase_m/20251011T223549Z/summary.md

Test status: test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation PASSES.
```

### Suggested Next Directive

**Option 1: Continue TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 Phase M3 Remaining Clusters**

Focus on C15 (mixed-units zero intensity) as highest-value physics bug:

```markdown
Summary: Debug C15 mixed-units zero intensity bug via parallel trace analysis
Mode: TDD
Focus: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 / C15 cluster
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: tests/test_at_parallel_015.py::TestATParallel015MixedUnits::test_mixed_units_comprehensive
Artifacts: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/c15_debug/
Do Now: Execute parallel trace debugging per docs/debugging/debugging.md SOP to identify
  root cause of zero intensity output in triclinic+XDS+rotations+dmin configuration.
  Hypothesis ranking: H1 (dmin too aggressive), H2 (unit conversion), H3 (XDS+rotations interaction).
```

**Option 2: Address VECTOR-PARITY-001 Unblock**

If test suite health goal met (13 failures acceptable threshold):

```markdown
Summary: Resume 4096² benchmark parity work (blocked since Phase D5)
Mode: Parity
Focus: VECTOR-PARITY-001 / Tap 5.3 instrumentation
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Artifacts: reports/vector-parity/tap_5.3/$STAMP/
Do Now: Complete Tap 5.3 parallel trace instrumentation per blocked status in fix_plan.md
```
