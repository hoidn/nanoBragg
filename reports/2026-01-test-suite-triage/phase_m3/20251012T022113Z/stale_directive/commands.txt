# Commands Log: Stale Directive Detection (8th Consecutive)

## STAMP Generation
export STAMP=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
echo $STAMP
# Output: 20251012T022113Z

## Directory Creation
mkdir -p reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/stale_directive

## Evidence Gathering

# Verify plan file existence (confirms missing active plan)
ls -la plans/active/detector-config.md 2>&1 || echo "File not found"
# Result: File not found

# Locate existing design documents (confirms work already done)
ls -la reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/*/mosflm_offset/design.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
# Found: 5+ design documents spanning STAMPs 20251011T201712Z through 20251011T214422Z

# Verify plan archival (confirms completion)
ls -la plans/archive/ | grep detector 2>/dev/null | head -5
# Found: detector-config_20251011_resolved.md (archived 2025-10-11)

## Analysis Results

- Referenced plan file does not exist: plans/active/detector-config.md
- Plan archived after completion: plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md
- Multiple design artifacts exist (5+ documents, most comprehensive: 23KB at STAMP 20251011T214422Z)
- Fix_plan.md status: done (archived) per line 232
- Cluster C8 status: âœ… RESOLVED per summary.md line 257
- Test status: test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation PASSES

## Redundancy Count

This is the **8th consecutive loop** detecting the same stale directive:
  - Attempt #36 (20251011T233622Z)
  - Attempt #37 (20251011T234401Z)
  - Attempt #38 (20251011T234802Z)
  - Attempt #39 (20251012T004433Z)
  - Attempt #40 (20251012T010425Z)
  - Attempt #41 (20251012T012246Z)
  - Attempt #42 (20251012T013323Z)
  - Current:    (20251012T022113Z)

## Recommendation

Supervisor should update input.md to:
1. Acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion
2. Redirect to active priority [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 (13 failures remaining)
   - Suggested focus: C15 mixed-units zero intensity bug (parallel trace debugging)
   OR
3. Redirect to alternative priority [VECTOR-PARITY-001] if suite health acceptable
