# Phase B Status Report — Work Already Complete

**Initiative:** DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 — Detector defaults audit
**Phase:** M3 Phase B (Behavior Contract & Blueprint Refresh)
**STAMP:** 20251011T220750Z
**Loop Type:** Docs-only status confirmation
**Status:** ✅ Phase B ALREADY COMPLETE — Implementation handoff required

---

## Executive Summary

This loop was initiated per `input.md` line 7 directive:
> "Draft the Option A remediation design under reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/mosflm_offset/design.md (plan Phase B tasks B1–B4)."

**Key Finding:** The requested design work was **already completed and verified** in prior loops. No new design authoring is required.

**Evidence:**
- **Design Document:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md` (583 lines, comprehensive)
- **Verification:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T220319Z/mosflm_offset/phase_b_verification.md` confirms all Phase B exit criteria met
- **Plan Status:** `plans/active/detector-config.md` Phase B tasks B1-B4 all marked **[D]** (Done)

**Current Reality:** Phase C (Implementation & Targeted Validation) is the actual next step, but that requires code changes incompatible with the docs-only mode specified in input.md line 21.

## Phase B Completion Evidence

### Tasks Verified Complete

Per `plans/active/detector-config.md` Phase B:

| Task ID | Description | Status | Evidence Location |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| B1 | Ratify remediation option | **[D]** | design.md §9 — Option A chosen with detailed rationale |
| B2 | Define config/CLI propagation | **[D]** | design.md §§1-3 — Full implementation specs with code examples |
| B3 | Map test & doc impacts | **[D]** | design.md §§4-5 — 5 new tests + 3 doc updates enumerated |
| B4 | Risk & compatibility assessment | **[D]** | design.md §6 — API-002, CONVENTION-001, device/dtype analysis complete |

### Design Document Structure

The canonical design at STAMP 20251011T214422Z includes:

- **§1 Configuration Layer Changes:** `BeamCenterSource` enum + `DetectorConfig` field extension
- **§2 CLI Parsing Layer Changes:** `determine_beam_center_source()` helper detecting 8 explicit flags
- **§3 Detector Layer Changes:** Two-condition guard for conditional +0.5 offset
- **§4 Test Impact Matrix:** 5 new test cases with full code examples
- **§5 Documentation Impact:** Updates required for detector.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md, findings.md
- **§6 Risk Assessment:** API-002/CONVENTION-001 interactions, backward compatibility analysis
- **§7 Acceptance Criteria:** Code, test, parity, docs, regression gates defined
- **§8 Implementation Sequence:** Phase C tasks C1-C7 mapped to validation commands
- **§9 Alternative Considered:** Option B (heuristic) rejected with rationale
- **§10-11 References & Metrics:** Normative specs cited, success metrics specified

**Total:** 583 lines covering all requirements plus implementation roadmap.

### Exit Criteria Met

From `plans/active/detector-config.md` Phase B exit criteria:

- ✅ Design artifact captured under `reports/.../mosflm_offset/`
- ✅ Plan tasks specify concrete implementation steps (§8 Implementation Sequence)
- ✅ Option A adopted with detailed rationale (§9)
- ⚠️ input.md references it — **STALE** (uses placeholder `$STAMP`, refers to already-completed work)

**Assessment:** All substantive Phase B exit criteria are met. The input.md staleness is a supervisor handoff synchronization issue, not a technical blocker.

---

## Normative Compliance

### Spec Alignment

The design correctly implements:

**specs/spec-a-core.md §72:**
> "MOSFLM: Fbeam = Ybeam + 0.5·pixel; Sbeam = Xbeam + 0.5·pixel (after mm→pixels)."

**arch.md §ADR-03:**
> "MOSFLM applies +0.5 pixel offset to beam center calculations when deriving from detector geometry defaults. Explicit user-provided beam centers must not be adjusted."

### Key Design Decision

**Chosen Approach:** Option A — Beam Center Source Tracking via `beam_center_source` enum field

**Rationale:**
1. **Semantic clarity:** Explicitly tracks auto vs explicit beam center provenance
2. **Robustness:** No false positives when user provides default-matching values
3. **Auditability:** Clean CLI → config → detector pipeline tracing
4. **Spec alignment:** Directly implements spec-a-core.md §72 distinction between defaults and explicit values

**Option B Rejected:** Heuristic value comparison deemed too fragile (see design.md §9).

## Current State Summary

### What Exists
- ✅ Comprehensive 583-line design document (20251011T214422Z)
- ✅ Prior verification confirming completeness (20251011T220319Z)
- ✅ Plan file marking Phase B tasks [D] (Done)
- ✅ Implementation roadmap (Phase C tasks C1-C7) ready

### What's Missing
- ❌ **Code implementation** (Phase C work — requires code changes, incompatible with docs-only loop)
- ❌ **Targeted validation** (Phase C work — requires pytest execution)
- ❌ **Documentation sync** (Phase C work — contingent on code implementation)

### Why This Loop Happened

The `input.md` directive appears to be **stale** — it references Phase B design work that was completed in a prior loop (STAMP 20251011T214422Z) and verified subsequently (STAMP 20251011T220319Z).

**Hypothesis:** Supervisor handoff memo (input.md) was not refreshed after Phase B completion, leading to redundant delegation of already-finished work.

---

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (This Loop — Docs-Only)

1. ✅ **Document Phase B status** (this file)
2. ⏭️ **Update fix_plan.md** [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] Attempts History with findings from this loop
3. ⏭️ **Update plans/active/detector-config.md** to note repeated Phase B verification (no new work added)
4. ⏭️ **Prepare Phase C handoff memo** for supervisor clarifying implementation requirements

### Next Loop (Phase C Implementation — CODE REQUIRED)

**Prerequisites:**
- Input.md mode must be **NOT docs-only** (requires code/test changes)
- Estimated effort: 3-5 hours
- Blocking: awaiting supervisor approval/handoff

**Tasks (per design.md §8):**
1. C1: Update configuration layer (`config.py` — enum + field)
2. C2: Adjust CLI parsing (`__main__.py` — detection logic)
3. C3: Apply conditional offset in Detector (`detector.py` — two-condition guard)
4. C4: Expand regression coverage (new `test_beam_center_source.py` + updates)
5. C5: Targeted validation bundle (16/16 tests passing)
6. C6: Documentation sync (detector.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md)
7. C7: Ledger & tracker update (fix_plan + remediation_tracker)

**Success Metrics:**
- 16/16 targeted tests passing
- C8 cluster resolved (1 → 0 failures)
- No new regressions in targeted bundle

### Supervisor Coordination

**Clarification Needed:**
- **Correct delegation:** Next loop should reference **Phase C implementation**, not Phase B design
- **Mode flag:** Next input.md should NOT specify `Mode: Docs` (code changes required)
- **Artifacts path:** Next loop uses new STAMP for Phase C validation artifacts
- **Exit gate:** Phase C requires targeted validation bundle before Phase D full-suite rerun

## Artifacts

### This Loop (20251011T220750Z)
- `phase_b_status.md` — This document confirming Phase B already complete

### Prior Loops (Evidence Chain)
- `20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md` — Canonical 583-line design document
- `20251011T220319Z/mosflm_offset/phase_b_verification.md` — Prior verification of design completeness

### Plan Files
- `plans/active/detector-config.md` — Phase B marked [D], Phase C awaiting handoff
- `docs/fix_plan.md` — [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] tracking ledger

---

## Findings & Observations

### 1. Input.md Staleness Pattern

This is the **second verification loop** confirming Phase B is complete (first was 20251011T220319Z). This suggests:
- Supervisor handoff memo not refreshed after prior verification
- Loop churn risk if input.md continues referencing completed work

**Recommendation:** Supervisor playbook should check plan file status before delegating to avoid redundant loops.

### 2. Docs-Only Mode Constraint

The input.md specifies `Mode: Docs` (line 2) and explicitly prohibits src/tests edits (line 21-22). This is **incompatible** with Phase C requirements, which demand:
- Code changes in 3 files (config.py, __main__.py, detector.py)
- New test file creation (test_beam_center_source.py)
- Pytest execution for validation

**Implication:** Phase C cannot proceed until input.md mode constraint is lifted.

### 3. Design Quality Assessment

The existing design (20251011T214422Z) is **implementation-ready**:
- ✅ All code changes specified with examples
- ✅ Test cases provided with full implementations
- ✅ Risk assessment comprehensive
- ✅ Validation commands documented
- ✅ Phase C tasks mapped to design sections

**No design gaps identified.** Implementation can proceed immediately upon handoff.

### 4. No Blockers to Phase C

Technical readiness: ✅ Complete
- Design approved
- Implementation sequence defined
- Test strategy validated
- Risk mitigation documented

**Only blocker:** Supervisor handoff synchronization (input.md update required).

---

## Conclusion

**Phase B Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (verified for second time)

**Design Artifact:** Comprehensive, implementation-ready, no gaps

**Next Step:** **Phase C implementation handoff** per `plans/active/detector-config.md` tasks C1-C7

**Loop Outcome:** No new work added; existing design confirmed adequate. This loop served as redundant verification due to input.md staleness.

**Recommendation to Supervisor:** Update input.md to delegate Phase C implementation (code + tests + docs changes), remove `Mode: Docs` constraint, and reference design.md at STAMP 20251011T214422Z as the blueprint.

---

**Loop Result:** ✅ Phase B status confirmed — awaiting Phase C implementation handoff

**Next:** Update fix_plan.md Attempts History, commit this status document, hand off to supervisor for Phase C delegation.
