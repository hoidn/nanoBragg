# STAMP: 20251011T220750Z
# Mode: Docs-only
# Result: Phase B already complete, input.md stale

# Evidence Review Commands:
ls -la reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/*/mosflm_offset/
cat reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md | head -50

cat plans/active/detector-config.md | grep -A 5 "Phase B"

# Finding: Phase B complete at STAMP 20251011T214422Z (583-line design)
# Finding: Prior verification at STAMP 20251011T220319Z confirmed completeness
# Finding: plan/active/detector-config.md Phase B tasks B1-B4 all marked [D]
# Finding: input.md directive to "draft design" is stale (work already done)

# Conclusion: No new design work required
# Recommendation: Update input.md to delegate Phase C implementation
