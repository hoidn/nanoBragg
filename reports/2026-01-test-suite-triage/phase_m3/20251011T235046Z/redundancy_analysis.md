# Redundancy Analysis — input.md Stale Directive
**STAMP:** 20251011T235046Z
**Context:** [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] Phase B design request (input.md line 7)
**Finding:** Work already complete; no action required

---

## Observation

The current `input.md` directive requests drafting Option A design for Phase B (tasks B1–B4).

**This work was completed in prior loops** (fix_plan.md Attempts #42-59, spanning 2025-10-11).

---

## Evidence of Completion

### 1. Fix Plan Status (docs/fix_plan.md:232)
- Status: **"done (archived)"**
- Completion Date: 2025-10-11
- Plan Reference: `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`

### 2. Phase B Design Complete
- Design Document: `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md`
- Size: 583+ lines, 11 sections
- Exit Criteria: All B1-B4 tasks complete

### 3. Phase C Implementation Complete
- BeamCenterSource enum added (config.py)
- CLI detection (8 flags, __main__.py)
- Conditional offset (detector.py)
- 5 new tests (test_beam_center_source.py)
- Documentation synced

### 4. Phase D Validation Complete (STAMP 20251011T223549Z)
- Full-suite: 554 passed / 13 failed / 119 skipped (80.8%)
- C8 test PASSES: `test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation` ✅
- 0 new regressions

## Root Cause: Plan File Archived

Referenced plan file `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68` does not exist (archived after completion).

---

## Next Priority Recommendation

Update input.md to redirect to **[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]** (Critical, in_progress):

**Current Status:** 13 failures remaining (Phase M2, STAMP 20251011T193829Z)

**Remaining Clusters:**
1. C2 Gradients (10 failures, workaround documented, P3)
2. C8 MOSFLM (1 failure, RESOLVED - needs tracker update)
3. C15 Mixed Units (1 failure, zero intensity bug, P2 - needs callchain)
4. C16 Orthogonality (1 failure, tolerance adjustment, P3)

**Recommended Next Action:** Proceed to C15 (mixed-units investigation) or C16 (tolerance adjustment).

---

## Attempt Pattern

**Third consecutive redundant loop:**
- Attempt #58: First detection
- Attempt #59: Second confirmation
- Attempt #60: This observation

**Loop churn risk continues without input.md update.**
