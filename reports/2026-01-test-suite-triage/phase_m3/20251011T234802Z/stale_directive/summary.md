# Ralph Attempt #38: Stale Input Directive — DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Already Complete

**STAMP:** 20251011T234802Z
**Loop Type:** Docs/Verification
**Result:** ✅ Redundancy confirmed (3rd consecutive duplicate detection)

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** The `input.md` directive requesting DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B design is **stale and redundant**. This is the **third consecutive loop** (Attempts #36, #37, #38) confirming the same finding.

**Evidence:** All requested work was completed in prior loops (Attempts #31-56 spanning Phase M3a through Phase D full-suite validation).

**Status:** [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] is **done** (fix_plan.md:19), archived, and validated.

---

## Verification Summary

### 1. Plan File Referenced in input.md
**Referenced:** `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68`
**Status:** ❌ **File does not exist** (archived after completion)

```bash
$ ls plans/active/detector-config.md
ls: cannot access 'plans/active/detector-config.md': No such file or directory
```

**Archived Location:** `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` (per fix_plan.md evidence)

### 2. Fix Plan Status
**Entry:** fix_plan.md line 19
**Status:** `done`
**Title:** "Detector defaults audit"

### 3. Completion Evidence

**Phase M3a Summary (Attempt #31):**
- Consolidated C6/C8 cluster findings
- Synchronized with detector-config plan Phase B
- Blueprint ready for implementation

**Design Document:**
- Location: `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md`
- Size: 23KB (583+ lines, 11 sections)
- Exit Criteria: B1-B4 all satisfied

**Phase C Implementation:**
- `BeamCenterSource` enum added (AUTO/EXPLICIT)
- CLI detection logic (8 explicit beam center flags)
- Conditional offset in detector.py (MOSFLM + AUTO only)
- 5 new test cases in `tests/test_beam_center_source.py`
- Targeted validation: 16/16 PASSED

**Phase D Validation (STAMP 20251011T223549Z):**
- Full-suite rerun: 554 passed / 13 failed / 119 skipped (80.8% pass rate)
- **C8 test PASSES:** `test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation` ✅
- **No new regressions**

**Summary Document (Attempt #42+):**
- Location: `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/mosflm_offset/summary.md`
- Lines 257-365: Complete Phase M3 Resolution Summary
- Status: ✅ RESOLVED

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why is input.md stale?**

The supervisor (`galph`) created `input.md` referencing `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68` for Phase B design work. However:

1. **Phase B-C-D were completed** in Attempts #31-56
2. **Plan was archived** to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`
3. **input.md was not updated** to acknowledge completion or redirect to active priorities
4. **Ralph executed the same verification 3 times** (Attempts #36, #37, #38)

**Consequence:** Wasted 3 loop iterations on redundant verification instead of productive work.

## Actual Completion Timeline

| Phase | Attempt | STAMP | Deliverable | Status |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|--------|

| M3b (Design) | #42 | 20251011T214422Z | Option A design document (23KB) | ✅ Done |
| C (Implementation) | #43-48 | 20251011T213351Z | BeamCenterSource enum + CLI + tests | ✅ Done |
| D (Validation) | #56 | 20251011T223549Z | Full-suite rerun (554/13/119) | ✅ Done |

## Recommended Actions

### For Supervisor (galph)

1. **Update input.md** to acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion
2. **Redirect to active priority:** [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] (Critical, in_progress)
3. **Review fix_plan.md** before writing input.md directives to avoid stale references

### For Ralph (next loop)

**Proceed with highest-value active work per fix_plan.md:**

**Option A (Highest Priority):** [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] (Critical, in_progress)
- 13 failures remaining per Phase M2 (Attempt #35)
- Clusters: C2 (gradients), C15 (mixed-units), C16 (orthogonality)
- Next: Full-suite rerun to capture current baseline

**Option B (Alternative):** [VECTOR-PARITY-001] (High, blocked)
- Depends on suite health
- Wait for TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 resolution

**Option C (Alternative):** [PERF-PYTORCH-004] (High, in_progress)
- Physics kernel fusion
- Can proceed independently

## Artifacts

**Directory:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T234802Z/stale_directive/`

**Files:**
- `summary.md` (this file)
- `commands.txt` (verification commands)

---

## Loop Metrics

- **Runtime:** Docs-only verification (~2 min)
- **Commands Executed:** `ls plans/active/detector-config.md`, `grep DETECTOR-CONFIG docs/fix_plan.md`
- **Pytest Execution:** None (redundant verification)
- **New Code:** None
- **Documentation Updates:** This summary only

---

## Observations

1. **Third Consecutive Duplicate:** Attempts #36, #37, #38 all reached the same conclusion
2. **Supervisor Handoff Gap:** input.md not synchronized with fix_plan.md completion status
3. **Wasted Cycles:** 3 loops (~6-8 minutes) spent re-confirming redundancy
4. **Archival Reference Missing:** Plan archived without updating input.md pointer

---

## Next Action (Self-Selected)

Since the supervisor directive is stale, Ralph will **self-select the highest-value work** per fix_plan.md priority table.

**Selected:** [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 full-suite baseline rerun

**Rationale:**
- Critical priority
- in_progress status
- 13 failures remaining (per Phase M2)
- Prerequisite for all other remediation work

**Command:**
```bash
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tee reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T234802Z/full_suite/pytest.log
```

---

**Status:** ✅ Stale directive documented; proceeding with self-selected TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 baseline rerun
