# Full Suite Timeout (Attempt #38)

**STAMP:** 20251011T234802Z
**Status:** ⏱️ Timeout (10 minutes)
**Coverage:** ~75% (520+ tests executed before timeout)

---

## Execution Summary

**Command:**
```bash
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v --tb=short
```

**Result:**
- Timeout at 10 minutes (600s limit)
- Last test reached: `tests/test_gradients.py::TestAdvancedGradients::test_joint_gradcheck` (~75% progress)
- Matches historical timeout pattern from fix_plan.md Attempts #2, #5, #7

---

## Observed Progress

**Tests Executed:** ~520/692 (75%)
**Tests Remaining:** ~172 (25%)

**Last Module Completed:** `test_detector_geometry.py`, `test_detector_pivots.py`, `test_divergence_culling.py`
**Module In Progress:** `test_gradients.py` (gradient checks timeout per historical pattern)

---

## Historical Pattern

Per fix_plan.md attempts history:
- **Attempt #2:** 75% completion (520/692), 600s timeout
- **Attempt #5:** 100% completion, 1864.76s (31 min) required
- **Attempt #7:** 100% completion, 1860.74s (31 min) required

**Conclusion:** Full suite requires ≥30 min timeout for complete coverage.

---

## Observations

1. **Detector Config Tests:** All passing (~70% mark)
2. **Gradient Tests:** Started but timeout during execution (~75% mark)
3. **Remaining Tests:** Likely include parity matrix, integration tests, and additional gradients

---

## Recommendation

**For Next Loop:**
Either:
1. Extend timeout to 3600s (60 min) for complete coverage
2. Run targeted test subsets instead of full suite
3. Skip gradient tests for faster baseline (add `-k "not gradients"`)

**Selected:** Option 2 (targeted subsets) per fix_plan priority

---

## Artifacts

- **Log:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T234802Z/full_suite/pytest.log` (partial, ~520 tests)
- **Exit Code:** Timeout (no exit code available)

## Next Action

Per Ralph's ground rules: Since this was exploratory and timed out, proceed with documentation of stale directive finding and commit progress.
