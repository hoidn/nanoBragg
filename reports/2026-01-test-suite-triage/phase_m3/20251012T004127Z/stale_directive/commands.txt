## Evidence Gathering Commands (Executed)

# Check fix_plan.md DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 status
grep -A 10 "DETECTOR-CONFIG-001" docs/fix_plan.md | head -20

# Verify archived plan location
ls -lh plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md

# Check active plan directory (should be empty for this item)
ls plans/active/detector-config.md 2>&1 || echo "File not found (archived as expected)"

# Review Phase D validation results
ls -lh reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T223549Z/summary.md

# Check C8 cluster resolution summary
ls -lh reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/mosflm_offset/summary.md

## Verification Commands (Run to Confirm Completion)

# C8 targeted test (should PASS)
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_003.py::TestATParallel003::test_detector_offset_preservation

# Beam center source tests (should all PASS)
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v tests/test_beam_center_source.py

# Detector config tests (should all PASS)
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v tests/test_detector_config.py

## Expected Results (Verified in Phase D)
# All tests above: PASSED (verified STAMP 20251011T223549Z)
# Total runtime: <10s for all three commands combined

## Next Priority: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] C15 Cluster

# Reproduce C15 failure (zero intensity bug)
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_015.py::TestATParallel015MixedUnits::test_mixed_units_comprehensive -x

# Expected: FAILED (AssertionError: Zero maximum intensity)
# Context: Triclinic crystal with XDS detector, Cu K-alpha, dmin=2.0Ã…
# Reference: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/mixed_units/summary.md

## Alternative Priority: [VECTOR-PARITY-001]

# High priority, previously blocked on suite health
# Now may be unblocked after C8 resolution and suite stabilization
# No specific reproduction command (scope broader than single test)
