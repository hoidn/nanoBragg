# Stale Directive Detection #9 — DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Completion Reconfirmed

**STAMP:** 20251012T022816Z
**Detection:** 9th consecutive redundant input.md directive
**Directive:** Draft Option A design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B
**Status:** Work already complete and archived

---

## Executive Summary

**Input.md continues to request DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B design work despite completion and archival in prior loops.** This is the **9th consecutive detection** of this stale directive (preceded by Attempts #36-45 in fix_plan.md).

**Work Status:** [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] is **COMPLETE** and **ARCHIVED** (status: done, completion date: 2025-10-11).

**Root Cause:** Referenced plan file `plans/active/detector-config.md` was archived to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` after completion, but input.md was not updated accordingly.

**Most comprehensive:** `20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md` (583+ lines, 11 sections)

### 4. Implementation Complete

**Phase C Implementation:** Completed in Attempts #42-57

- **BeamCenterSource Enum:** Added to `src/nanobrag_torch/config.py`

- **Conditional Offset:** Applied in `src/nanobrag_torch/models/detector.py`
- **Test Coverage:** 5 new tests in `tests/test_beam_center_source.py`

**Validation:** Targeted test PASSES

```bash
$ pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_003.py::TestATParallel003::test_detector_offset_preservation
# Result: PASSED (evidence: Phase M3 Attempt #40)
```

### 5. Phase D Validation Complete

**Full-Suite Rerun:** STAMP 20251011T223549Z

- **Results:** 554 passed / 13 failed / 119 skipped (80.8% pass rate)
- **C8 Test:** `test_detector_offset_preservation` ✅ **PASSES**
- **No Regressions:** All 13 failures pre-existed in Phase M2 baseline

**Evidence:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T223549Z/summary.md`

### 6. Documentation Synced

- ✅ `docs/architecture/detector.md` (updated §§8.2/9)
- ✅ `docs/development/c_to_pytorch_config_map.md` (new §Beam Center Source Detection)
- ✅ `docs/findings.md` (API-002 cross-reference)

## Redundancy Timeline

| Attempt | Date | Finding |
|---------|------|---------|
| #36 | 2025-10-11 | 1st detection: Work complete, input.md stale |
| #37 | 2025-10-11 | 2nd detection: Reconfirmed completion |
| #38 | 2025-10-11 | 3rd detection: Self-selected TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 |
| #39 | 2025-10-12 | 4th detection: Reconfirmed completion |
| #40 | 2025-10-12 | 5th detection: Logged Phase M2 results |
| #41 | 2025-10-12 | 6th detection: Created Phase M3 evidence bundle |
| #42 | 2025-10-12 | 7th detection: Self-selected C15 evidence capture |
| #44 | 2025-10-12 | 8th detection: Comprehensive remaining clusters evidence |
| #45 | 2025-10-12 | 9th detection (current loop) |

**Pattern:** Input.md has been stale for **9 consecutive loops** (~24 hours of wall-clock time).

---

## Impact Assessment

### Lost Productivity

- **9 loops:** ~9 hours of potential implementation work (assuming 1h/loop)
- **Redundant Attempts:** #42-57 (16 loops) created multiple design documents for completed work
- **Total Lost:** ~25 loops (~25 hours) across all redundancy work

### Correct Path Forward

**Self-Selection Per Ralph Ground Rules:**

> "After detecting stale directive, self-select the highest-priority active work."

**Current Priorities (from fix_plan.md:10-19):**

1. **[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]** — Critical, in_progress (13 failures remaining)
2. **[VECTOR-PARITY-001]** — High, in_progress
3. **[CLI-FLAGS-003]** — High, in_progress

## Recommendation to Supervisor

**Update input.md with:**

```markdown
Summary: Acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion and delegate active priority work.
Mode: Implementation
Focus: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] / Phase M3 remaining clusters
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_015.py::TestATParallel015MixedUnits::test_mixed_units_comprehensive
Do Now: Debug C15 mixed-units zero intensity bug using parallel trace workflow per debugging.md SOP.
Priorities & Rationale:
- [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] is COMPLETE (archived 2025-10-11, C8 test passing)
- [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] has 13 failures remaining (C2 gradients workaround documented, C15 zero intensity needs callchain, C16 tolerance fixed Attempt #43, C17/C18 deferred)
- C15 is highest-value active bug: physics failure (zero intensity), triclinic+XDS+rotations+dmin configuration
How-To Map:
1. Read debugging.md parallel trace SOP and C15 evidence bundle (phase_m3/20251012T014618Z/remaining_clusters/summary.md)
2. Execute H1 dmin probe: rerun test with dmin=None to rule out overly aggressive resolution cutoff
3. If H1 fails, execute parallel trace: instrument C nanoBragg and debug_pixel_trace.py for same config
4. Compare traces line-by-line to find first numeric divergence
5. Fix divergence and rerun targeted validation
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:38-100 (TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 status)
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251012T014618Z/remaining_clusters/summary.md (C15 evidence)
- docs/debugging/debugging.md (parallel trace SOP)
```

## Ralph Self-Selection

**Per Ralph prompt ground rules, I will now self-select [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] and execute meaningful work on the highest-priority active cluster.**

**Selected Work:** C15 mixed-units zero intensity bug investigation (H1 dmin probe as first hypothesis test)

**Rationale:**
- Critical priority test suite health issue
- Physics failure (all-zero output despite valid config)
- Clear investigation path (H1-H6 hypotheses ranked by likelihood)
- Blocked by 9 loops of stale directive responses

---

## Artifacts

- **This Summary:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251012T022816Z/stale_directive/summary.md`
- **Fix Plan Entry:** Will append to `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempts History (Attempt #46)
- **Commands:** Documented in `commands.txt` (this STAMP)

---

**Status:** 9th redundancy documented, proceeding to self-selected active work per Ralph ground rules.
