# Ralph Loop Summary — Attempt #64 (6th Consecutive Redundancy)

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Engineer:** Ralph
**Loop Duration:** <5 min (docs-only observation)
**Mode:** Stale input.md detection + halt

## Problem Statement

Input.md requested drafting Option A design for **[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]** Phase B (tasks B1–B4), but this work was comprehensively completed in Attempts #42–62 spanning multiple days and phases (B/C/D).

## Redundancy Pattern

This is the **6th consecutive redundant loop** (Attempts #58–64, spanning 2 days):
- Attempts #58–62: Each loop detected completion, recommended input.md update
- Attempt #63: Identified actual priority (TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 C15 cluster)
- Attempt #64 (this loop): Halted to avoid further churn

## Work Already Complete

### Design (Phase B)
- **Primary artifact:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md`
- **Completeness:** 583+ lines, 11 sections, all B1–B4 exit criteria satisfied
- **Alternative designs:** Multiple comprehensive documents at STAMPs 20251011T201712Z, 20251011T203822Z, 20251011T212123Z, 20251011T214422Z, 20251011T215044Z, 20251011T215645Z, 20251011T220319Z, 20251011T221246Z, 20251011T230052Z, 20251011T233028Z

### Implementation (Phase C)
- **Code changes:** BeamCenterSource enum (config.py), CLI detection with 8 explicit flags (__main__.py), conditional offset (detector.py)
- **Test coverage:** 5 new tests in test_beam_center_source.py
- **Documentation:** detector.md §§8.2/9, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md Detector table, findings.md API-002 cross-reference
- **Evidence:** C8 summary at `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/mosflm_offset/summary.md:257-365`

### Validation (Phase D)
- **Full-suite rerun:** STAMP 20251011T223549Z
- **Results:** 554 passed (80.8%), 13 failed, 119 skipped
- **C8 status:** Test `test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation` **PASSES** (was failing)
- **Regressions:** 0 new failures introduced

### Current Status
- **fix_plan.md:232:** Status = **"done (archived)"**
- **Completion date:** 2025-10-11
- **Plan archived:** `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`
- **Cluster C8:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Root Cause

**Stale input.md directive:**
- References plan file `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68` which **does not exist** (archived post-completion)
- Supervisor handoff memo not refreshed after Phase B/C/D completion
- Loop churn: 6 consecutive redundant attempts (Attempts #58–64) with 0 progress

## Actual Priority (Identified in Attempt #63)

**[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]** — Full pytest run and triage
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Status:** in_progress
- **Owner:** ralph/2025-10-11
- **Current State:** Phase M2 complete (561/13/112 pass/fail/skip, 81.7% pass rate, STAMP 20251011T193829Z)
- **Next Actions (from fix_plan.md:229–264):**
  1. ✅ Log STAMP 20251011T193829Z results (completed Attempt #40)
  2. ⏳ Create Phase M3 evidence bundle for 4 remaining clusters (C2 gradients, C8 MOSFLM [resolved], C15 mixed units, C16 orthogonality)
  3. ⏳ Update `plans/active/test-suite-triage.md` Phase M status and prep supervisor handoff

## Recommendation

**For Supervisor (galph):**
1. **Acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion** in input.md
2. **Update input.md directive** to one of:
   - **Option A (recommended):** Delegate TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 Phase M3 evidence bundle creation (Next Action #2)
   - **Option B:** Delegate TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 C15 cluster debugging (zero intensity bug)
   - **Option C:** Redirect to alternative priority (VECTOR-PARITY-001, SOURCE-WEIGHT-002, etc.)
3. **Remove stale plan reference:** input.md:11 cites non-existent `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68`

**For Ralph (next loop):**
- Wait for updated input.md before proceeding
- Do NOT draft additional DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B designs (work is complete)
- Focus on TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 when directed

## Loop Output (Per Ralph Prompt Requirements)

### Problem Statement
Input.md requested drafting Option A design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B, but this work was already completed comprehensively in Attempts #42–62.

### Spec/Arch References
- **spec-a-core.md §72:** MOSFLM beam center mapping with +0.5 pixel offset
- **arch.md §ADR-03:** Beam-center mapping convention rules
- **fix_plan.md:232:** DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 status = "done (archived)"

### Search Summary
- Verified design artifact exists at `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md` (583+ lines)
- Verified Phase C implementation complete per C8 summary
- Verified Phase D validation complete (STAMP 20251011T223549Z: C8 PASSES)
- Verified plan archived to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`

### Changes
None (docs-only observation loop).

### Test Results
None (no test execution; observation only).

### fix_plan.md Delta
- Added Attempt #64 to DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Attempts History documenting 6th consecutive redundancy and halt decision
- No status changes (item remains "done (archived)")

### CLAUDE.md Updates
None required.

### arch.md Updates
None proposed (MOSFLM offset behavior already documented in ADR-03).

### Next Loop Selection
**If input.md remains stale:** Continue halting to avoid further churn.

**If input.md updated:** Execute directive (recommended: TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 Phase M3 evidence bundle or C15 cluster debugging).
