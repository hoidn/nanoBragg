# Redundancy Detection Note

**Loop:** Ralph Attempt #41
**STAMP:** 20251012T012246Z
**Input directive:** Draft Option A remediation design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001

## Finding
Input.md request is **STALE AND REDUNDANT** (6th consecutive detection, following Attempts #36-40).

## Evidence
- 18 existing design.md files under phase_m3/, most recent at 20251012T011824Z (547 lines)
- Archived plan: `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` with all phases A-D marked `[D]`
- fix_plan.md line 19: `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001]` status=done
- Implementation complete per Attempts #42-57 (not yet in fix_plan)
- Phase D validation complete: STAMP 20251011T223549Z, 554/13/119 pass/fail/skip

## Self-Selection
Per Ralph ground rules: after redundancy detection, self-select highest-priority meaningful work.

**Selected:** [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 Next Actions item #2 â€” create evidence bundle for remaining 13 failures (C2/C8/C15/C16 clusters) from Phase M2 rerun.
