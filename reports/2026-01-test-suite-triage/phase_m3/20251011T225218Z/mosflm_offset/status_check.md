# DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Status Check

**STAMP:** 20251011T225218Z
**Loop:** Ralph Attempt (responding to input.md directive)
**Finding:** Work Already Complete

---

## Summary

The `input.md` directive requested drafting the Option A remediation design for Phase B tasks B1-B4. However, investigation reveals **all phases of [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] are already complete**:

---

## Completion Status

### Phase B: Behavior Contract & Blueprint Refresh — ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Completion STAMP:** 20251011T214422Z
**Verification STAMP:** 20251011T220319Z
**Artifact:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T221246Z/mosflm_offset/design.md`

**Tasks:**
- [x] B1: Remediation option ratified (Option A selected)
- [x] B2: Config/CLI propagation defined (enum, detection logic, code examples)
- [x] B3: Test & doc impacts mapped (5 new tests, 3 file updates documented)
- [x] B4: Risk assessment complete (API-002/CONVENTION-001/device-dtype interactions documented)

**Design Artifacts:**
- 23,852-byte comprehensive design document
- 10 sections covering normative references, implementation strategy, test coverage, risk assessment
- Exit criteria validated: all B1-B4 tasks marked complete

---

### Phase C: Implementation & Targeted Validation — ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Completion:** Per `plans/active/detector-config.md` line 15
**Referenced Attempt:** #42 (not yet in fix_plan.md ledger, but plan marks Phase C [D])

**Tasks:**
- [x] C1: Update configuration layer (BeamCenterSource enum, DetectorConfig field)
- [x] C2: Adjust CLI parsing (8-flag detection, header ingestion handling)
- [x] C3: Apply conditional offset in Detector (beam_center_s/f_pixels properties)
- [x] C4: Expand regression coverage (test_beam_center_source.py created)
- [x] C5: Targeted validation bundle (16/16 tests passed, 1.95s)
- [x] C6: Documentation sync (detector.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md, findings.md updated)
- [x] C7: Ledger & tracker update (C8 cluster marked RESOLVED pending commit)

**Artifacts:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T213351Z/mosflm_fix/`

---

### Phase D: Full-Suite Regression & Closure — ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Completion STAMP:** 20251011T223549Z
**Referenced Attempt:** #56 (per plan line 16)

**Tasks:**
- [x] D1: Phase M chunked rerun (10-chunk ladder executed)
- [ ] D2: Synthesis & publication (marked [P] = Pending)
- [ ] D3: Plan archival (marked [P] = Pending)

**Results:**
- 686 tests collected, 554 passed (80.8%), 13 failed (1.9%), 119 skipped
- C8 test PASSES (cluster RESOLVED)
- No new regressions introduced

**Artifacts:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T223549Z/summary.md`

## Current State Analysis

### What's Done
1. **Design (Phase B):** Comprehensive 23KB design document ratifying Option A with full implementation specification
2. **Implementation (Phase C):** All 7 implementation tasks completed, 16/16 targeted tests passing
3. **Validation (Phase D):** Full-suite rerun confirms C8 cluster resolution, no regressions

### What's Pending
1. **Phase D2:** Update Phase K/M3 analysis summaries with post-fix results
2. **Phase D3:** Archive detector-config.md plan and mark [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] status "done" in fix_plan.md

### Why input.md Directive Appears Stale
- **input.md line 7:** "Draft the Option A remediation design under reports/.../design.md"
- **Reality:** Design drafted at 20251011T214422Z, verified at 20251011T220319Z, and finalized at 20251011T221246Z
- **Likely cause:** Supervisor's input.md was generated before Phases B/C/D completion but not refreshed post-implementation

## Recommended Next Actions

### Option 1: Complete Pending Documentation (Phase D2-D3)
**Scope:** Finish the last two tasks in the detector-config plan
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Tasks:**
1. Update `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_k/20251011T072940Z/analysis/summary.md` with C8 resolution notes
2. Update `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/mosflm_offset/summary.md` with implementation outcome
3. Move `plans/active/detector-config.md` to `plans/archive/`
4. Mark [DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] status "done" in `docs/fix_plan.md`
5. Update `plans/active/test-suite-triage.md` remediation tracker with C8 RESOLVED

### Option 2: Verify No Regression
**Scope:** Rerun targeted tests to confirm implementation is stable
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes
**Commands:**
```bash
env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v \
  tests/test_detector_config.py \
  tests/test_at_parallel_003.py::TestATParallel003::test_detector_offset_preservation
```

### Option 3: Proceed to Next Priority
**Scope:** Move to next item in fix_plan.md or input.md priorities
**Candidates:**
- C15: Mixed Units investigation (1 failure remaining in Phase M2 rerun)
- C16: Orthogonality Tolerance adjustment (1 failure remaining)
- TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 Phase M3 follow-through documentation

---

## Artifacts Generated This Loop

- **This status check:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T225218Z/mosflm_offset/status_check.md`
- **STAMP directory:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T225218Z/` (created but minimal content)

---

## Conclusion

**[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001] is functionally complete.** The requested Phase B design work was finished 5 hours ago (at 20251011T221246Z). The implementation (Phase C) and validation (Phase D1) have also been executed successfully.

Only administrative tasks remain (Phase D2-D3: documentation updates and plan archival).

**Recommendation:** Skip redundant design drafting; proceed directly to Phase D2-D3 administrative closure or advance to the next priority item.
