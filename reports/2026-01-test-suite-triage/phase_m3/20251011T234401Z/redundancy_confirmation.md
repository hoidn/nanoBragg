# DETECTOR-CONFIG-001: Redundancy Confirmation

**STAMP:** 20251011T234401Z
**Engineer:** ralph
**Loop Type:** Docs-only (Step -1 validation)
**Result:** ✅ **NO ACTION REQUIRED** — Work already complete

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding:** The `input.md` request to "draft Option A remediation design under `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/mosflm_offset/design.md`" is **stale and redundant**. All requested work has been completed in prior loops (fix_plan.md Attempts #31-#56).

**Root Cause:** The referenced plan file `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68` **does not exist** (archived to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` after completion). The input.md directive was not updated to reflect the completed status.

**Action:** Document completion evidence below and update ledger to reflect no action required this loop.

---

## Completion Evidence

### 1. Design Document Exists

**Path:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T203303Z/mosflm_offset/design.md`
**Size:** 21,129 bytes (583 lines)
**Sections:** 12 comprehensive sections including:
- Executive Summary with Option A rationale
- Configuration layer changes (`DetectorConfig.beam_center_source`)
- CLI parsing logic (8 explicit flag detection)
- Detector model conditional offset
- Test impact matrix (5 new tests, 3 updated)
- Documentation impact (3 files)
- Risk assessment (API-002/CONVENTION-001 interactions)
- PyTorch device/dtype/differentiability neutrality verification
- Acceptance criteria (implementation, testing, C-parity, docs)
- Implementation sequence (7 tasks, 2h 45min estimated)
- Decision rationale (Option A vs Option B comparison)

**Status:** ✅ Complete — all Phase B tasks (B1-B4) marked [D] in archived plan.

---

### 2. Implementation Complete

**Archived Plan:** `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`
**Status Snapshot (lines 12-16):**
```
- Phase A — Evidence & Guardrail Alignment · **[D]**
- Phase B — Behavior Contract & Blueprint Refresh · **[D]**
- Phase C — Implementation & Targeted Validation · **[D]**
- Phase D — Full-Suite Regression & Closure · **[D]**
```

**Phase C Tasks (lines 46-54):**
- C1: Update configuration layer → [D] `BeamCenterSource` enum added to `config.py`
- C2: Adjust CLI parsing → [D] 8 explicit flags detected in `__main__.py`
- C3: Apply conditional offset in Detector → [D] Properties updated in `detector.py`
- C4: Expand regression coverage → [D] `test_beam_center_source.py` added
- C5: Targeted validation bundle → [D] 16/16 tests passed (1.95s)
- C6: Documentation sync → [D] `detector.md`, `c_to_pytorch_config_map.md` updated
- C7: Ledger & tracker update → [D] fix_plan.md (recorded as complete)

**Phase D Validation (lines 61-64):**
- D1: Phase M chunked rerun → [D] STAMP 20251011T223549Z
  - **Results:** 686 tests, 554 passed (80.8%), 13 failed (1.9%), 119 skipped
  - **C8 Cluster:** ✅ RESOLVED — `test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation` PASSES
  - **Regressions:** None (13 failures = baseline, C8 no longer counted)

### 3. Fix Plan Status

**Path:** `docs/fix_plan.md`
**Line 19:** `[DETECTOR-CONFIG-001](#detector-config-001-detector-defaults-audit) | Detector defaults audit | High | done |`

**Attempt Log:** fix_plan.md includes comprehensive attempt history with Attempts #31-#56 documenting Phase M3a sync through Phase D full-suite validation.

---

**Bundle Location:** Inferred from archived plan C5 task
**Commands Executed:**
```bash
pytest -v tests/test_detector_config.py
pytest -v tests/test_at_parallel_002.py tests/test_at_parallel_003.py::TestATParallel003::test_detector_offset_preservation
```

**Results:** 16/16 tests passed in 1.95s (per archived plan documentation)

---

### 5. Full-Suite Regression Evidence

**Bundle:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T223549Z/`
**Rerun Type:** Phase M 10-chunk ladder
**Results:**
- **Collected:** 686 tests (1 skipped)
- **Passed:** 554 (80.8%)
- **Failed:** 13 (1.9%)
- **Skipped:** 119 (17.3%)
- **Runtime:** ~502s across all chunks

**C8 Cluster Status (from archived plan D1):**
> C8 test PASSES, no new regressions. Summary at reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T223549Z/summary.md.

## Verification: No Open Work

### Plan File Status
```bash
$ ls plans/active/detector-config.md
ls: cannot access 'plans/active/detector-config.md': No such file or directory

$ ls plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md
plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md  # EXISTS ✓
```

### Design Artifacts Exist
```bash
$ find reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/ -name "design.md" -type f
.../20251011T201712Z/mosflm_offset/design.md  (31KB)
.../20251011T203303Z/mosflm_offset/design.md  (21KB) ← Most comprehensive
```

**Most Complete:** `20251011T203303Z/design.md` (21KB, 12 sections, all Phase B tasks satisfied)

---

## Why Input.md is Stale

**Input.md Lines 7-8 Request:**
```
Do Now: Draft the Option A remediation design under reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/mosflm_offset/design.md (plan Phase B tasks B1–B4).
If Blocked: Capture blocker details in reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/$STAMP/mosflm_offset/blocked.md
```

**Input.md Lines 11-13 Context:**
```
- plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68 — Phase B tasks demand a design artifact before coding.
```

**Problem:** Plan file referenced (`plans/active/detector-config.md`) **does not exist**. It was archived to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md` after all phases (A-D) completed.

**Evidence:** Archived plan lines 12-16 show all phases marked [D] (done).

**Conclusion:** Input.md was written before work completion and not updated to reflect resolved status.

## Cross-Reference: Fix Plan Attempt #36

**Location:** `docs/fix_plan.md` lines 88-89

**Attempt #36 Text (excerpt):**
> Result: 📋 **REDUNDANCY CONFIRMED (no action required)**. Docs-only verification loop (no pytest execution) per input.md directive requesting Phase B design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001. **Finding:** Input.md request is **stale and redundant**—work already completed in Attempts #42-57.

**Conclusion from Attempt #36:**
- Multiple design documents exist (most comprehensive at STAMP 20251011T214422Z, 583+ lines)
- Phase C implementation complete
- Phase D validation complete (C8 test PASSES, 0 new regressions)
- Status marked **done (archived)** on fix_plan.md
- Plan archived to `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`

**Current Loop (Attempt #37):** Confirms Attempt #36 findings remain accurate.

## Recommended Action

**For Supervisor (galph):**

Update `input.md` to acknowledge DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 completion and redirect to active priorities.

**Suggested New Input.md:**
```markdown
Summary: DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 complete (archived plan all phases [D], C8 cluster RESOLVED). Redirect to [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] active priorities.
Mode: Implementation
Focus: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 specialist follow-through
Branch: feature/spec-based-2
Mapped tests: TBD based on active cluster
Artifacts: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/<STAMP>/
Do Now: Select next cluster from Phase M2 baseline (13 failures remaining):
  - C2 (Gradients): Documentation complete, no action needed
  - C15 (Mixed-units): Zero intensity bug — investigate callchain
  - C16 (Orthogonality): Tolerance adjustment (Option A recommended per Phase M3b notes)
Pointers:
- docs/fix_plan.md:38-89 (TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 entry with Phase M2 results)
- reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m/20251011T193829Z/summary.md (13-failure breakdown)
- plans/active/test-suite-triage.md (Phase M3 task matrix)
```

**Alternative Priority:** If TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 Phase M3 work is deferred, consider:
- **[VECTOR-PARITY-001]** (High, blocked) — restore 4096² benchmark parity
- **[SOURCE-WEIGHT-002]** (High) — verify done status per fix_plan.md Attempt #15

## Ralph Loop Output

**Loop Scope:** Step -1 validation (Evidence Parameter Validation per prompt instructions)
**Problem Statement:** Input.md requests Phase B design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001, citing non-existent plan file.
**Execution Time:** Docs-only (no pytest execution per pitfall line 25)
**Result:** ✅ Request confirmed **stale and redundant** — all work complete per Attempts #31-#56
**Artifacts:**
- This document: `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T234401Z/redundancy_confirmation.md`
- Evidence cited: 5 artifact bundles, 1 archived plan (70 lines), 1 comprehensive design document (21KB, 12 sections)

**Next Action:** Awaiting updated input.md directive for active priority ([TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase M3 or alternative).
