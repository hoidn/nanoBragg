# Phase M3 Redundancy Analysis
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-11T23:36:22Z
**Ralph Loop:** Docs-only verification
**Status:** Input.md request is redundant - work already complete

## Executive Summary

The input.md directive (dated 2025-10-11) requests drafting Option A remediation design for DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 Phase B tasks (B1-B4). However, this work was **already completed and implemented** in fix_plan.md Attempts #42-57, with final status marked as **done (archived)** on 2025-10-11.

## Evidence of Completion

### 1. Design Documents
Multiple comprehensive design documents exist in the phase_m3 artifact tree:

```bash
$ find reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3 -name "design.md" | head -5
reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T203303Z/mosflm_offset/design.md
reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T215044Z/mosflm_offset/design.md
reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T230052Z/mosflm_offset/design.md
reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T214422Z/mosflm_offset/design.md (most comprehensive: 583+ lines)
reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T201712Z/mosflm_offset/design.md
```

The most comprehensive design at STAMP `20251011T214422Z` contains:
- 583+ lines
- 11 sections
- B1–B4 exit criteria all satisfied
- Option A implementation details

### 2. Implementation Complete (Phase C)
Per `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T193829Z/mosflm_offset/summary.md:257-365`:

**Implemented Components:**
- `BeamCenterSource` enum (config.py)
- CLI detection logic with 8 flags (__main__.py)
- Conditional offset application (detector.py)
- 5 new tests (test_beam_center_source.py)
- Documentation updates (detector.md, c_to_pytorch_config_map.md, findings.md)

### 3. Validation Complete (Phase D)
Per fix_plan.md Attempt #56 (STAMP 20251011T223549Z):

**Test Results:**
- 554 passed / 13 failed / 119 skipped (80.8% pass rate)
- C8 cluster test `test_at_parallel_003::test_detector_offset_preservation` **PASSES**
- 0 new regressions introduced
- C8 cluster marked ✅ **RESOLVED**

### 4. Archival Status
Per fix_plan.md line 232:
- Status: **done (archived)**
- Completion date: 2025-10-11
- Plan archived to: `plans/archive/detector-config_20251011_resolved.md`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why input.md is Outdated

1. **Missing Plan File:** input.md references `plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68` which **does not exist**
   - Verification: `ls plans/active/detector-config.md` → File not found
   - Likely cause: Plan was archived after completion but input.md not updated

2. **Stale Reference:** input.md line 11 cites:
   ```
   plans/active/detector-config.md:12-68 — Phase B tasks demand a design artifact before coding
   ```
   This directive was fulfilled in Attempts #42-44 (design phase) and #45-57 (implementation/validation)

3. **Timing Gap:** input.md appears to be from a snapshot taken before final completion/archival

## Current Priority Items (Per fix_plan.md)

### Critical: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]
- **Status:** in_progress
- **Last Attempt:** #18 (Phase M0) - ⚠️ BLOCKED (timeout)
- **Issue:** System timeout (360s) insufficient for full suite (~1860s required)
- **Current State:** 13 failures remaining across 4 clusters (C2, C8, C15, C16)
- **Blocker Resolution:** C8 (MOSFLM offset) now ✅ RESOLVED per Attempt #56

### High: [VECTOR-PARITY-001]
- **Status:** in_progress
- **Dependency:** Blocked on suite health improvement
- **Purpose:** Restore 4096² benchmark parity

### In Planning: Multiple items
- [DETECTOR-GRAZING-001] (extreme detector angles)
- [TOOLING-DUAL-RUNNER-001] (parity runner restoration)
- [DEBUG-TRACE-001] (debug flag support)

## Recommendations

### For Supervisor (input.md Author)

1. **Acknowledge Completion:** Update input.md to reflect DETECTOR-CONFIG-001 done status
2. **Redirect Focus:** Point to [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] as next critical priority
3. **New Directive:** Provide guidance on handling Phase M0 timeout:
   - Option A: Retry with corrected timeout (3600s) and proper STAMP variable
   - Option B: Proceed with Phase K baseline (31 failures from 20251011T072940Z)
   - Option C: Run targeted test subsets to avoid timeout

### For Engineer (Next Loop)

If input.md is updated to prioritize TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001:

1. **Preflight Checks:**
   - Pre-export STAMP variable to avoid double-slash path bugs
   - Use explicit timeout wrapper: `timeout 3600 pytest ...`
   - Create artifact directories before pytest invocation

2. **Targeted Approach (if full suite still times out):**
   - Run cluster-by-cluster: C2 (gradients), C15 (mixed-units), C16 (orthogonality)
   - Skip C8 (already resolved)
   - Document partial results for each cluster

3. **Artifact Requirements:**
   - `metrics.json` with pass/fail/skip counts
   - `pytest_full.xml` (JUnit format)
   - Failure logs for each cluster
   - Environment snapshot (Python/PyTorch versions)

## Artifacts Created This Loop

- **This document:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_m3/20251011T233622Z/redundancy_analysis.md`

## Next Actions

**Immediate (Supervisor):**
- [ ] Review this redundancy analysis
- [ ] Update input.md with TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 directive
- [ ] Provide timeout handling guidance (Option A/B/C)

**Blocked (Engineer):**
- [ ] Awaiting updated input.md before proceeding with next loop
- [ ] No code changes made this loop (docs-only per redundancy finding)

**Loop Outcome:** Docs-only verification confirming redundancy. No pytest execution. Awaiting supervisor guidance for next priority.
