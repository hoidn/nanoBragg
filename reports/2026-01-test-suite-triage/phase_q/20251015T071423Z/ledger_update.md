# Phase Q Ledger Update — C18 Tolerance Closure

**STAMP:** 20251015T071423Z
**Initiative:** TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 (Phase Q Q6 — Ledger & Tracker Closure)
**Mode:** Docs
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Executive Summary

Successfully closed C18 tolerance review and updated project ledgers with the approved 900s slow-gradient tolerance. This docs-only loop completed Phase Q Q6 by:

1. Updating `remediation_tracker.md` with C18 validation evidence and tolerance approval
2. Documenting Phase Q closure in `docs/fix_plan.md` as Attempt #80
3. Recording ledger update artifacts for audit trail

## Tracker Updates

### File: `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T043327Z/remediation_tracker.md`

**Updated Section:** C18 Performance Thresholds cluster entry (line ~46)

**Changes Made:**
- Status: `P4.1 in_planning` → `✅ RESOLVED`
- Added validation evidence citing Phase Q STAMP 20251015T071423Z
- Documented runtime: 839.14s (well within 900s tolerance with 6.7% margin)
- Referenced approved tolerance derivation from Phase P packet (20251015T060354Z)
- Updated Executive Summary counts to reflect C18 resolution

**Before/After Counts:**
- Active Clusters: 2 → 1 (only C2 remains with known workaround)
- Implementation Bugs: 10 → 0 (all resolved or documented as tolerance/infrastructure)
- C18 entry marked ✅ RESOLVED with artifact references

## Fix Plan Updates

### File: `docs/fix_plan.md`

**Added Entry:** Attempt #80 under `[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]` Attempts History

**Summary:**
- Loop type: Docs-only (evidence-only per mode)
- Phase: Q6 ledger closure
- Actions: Remediation tracker update + fix_plan Attempts entry + ledger summary
- Evidence: Phase Q validation (839.14s runtime, PASSED status)
- Outcome: C18 cluster resolved, tolerance approved and documented

## Evidence Chain

### Phase Q Validation Results (STAMP 20251015T071423Z)
- **Test:** `test_property_gradient_stability`
- **Runtime:** 839.14s (13m 59s)
- **Tolerance:** 900s (approved)
- **Margin:** 60.86s (6.7% spare capacity)
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED
- **Artifacts:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T071423Z/summary.md`

### Tolerance Derivation (Phase P)
- **Source:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_p/20251015T060354Z/c18_timing.md`
- **Baseline:** 845.68s (Phase O chunk 03)
- **Headroom:** 6% margin above observed runtimes
- **Validation:** Three independent reruns (Phase O/P/Q) confirm stability

### Documentation Updates (Already Complete per Q4)
- `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` §4.1 — Performance Expectations section
- `arch.md` §15 — Gradient Test Performance Expectations section
- `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` §5 — Gradient test performance reminder

## Artifacts Created This Loop

1. **This Document:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T071423Z/ledger_update.md`
2. **Tracker Edit:** Updated remediation_tracker.md with C18 resolution
3. **Fix Plan Entry:** Attempt #80 logged in docs/fix_plan.md

## Commands Executed

```bash
# No pytest — evidence-only loop per input.md Mode: Docs
export STAMP=20251015T071423Z
mkdir -p reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/${STAMP}

# Edit operations:
# - Updated remediation_tracker.md (C18 entry + Executive Summary)
# - Appended Attempt #80 to docs/fix_plan.md
# - Created this summary document

# Git status check:
git status
```

## Outcome

**✅ Phase Q Q6 COMPLETE.** C18 tolerance review is now fully closed:
- Remediation tracker reflects C18 ✅ RESOLVED status
- Fix plan ledger documents closure with artifact references
- Ledger update summary provides audit trail
- All Phase Q tasks (Q1-Q6) marked complete

**Test Suite Status Post-Q6:**
- Total Failures: 12 → 10 (C18 resolved, C2 has known workaround)
- Active Clusters: 1 (C19 gradient flow investigation remains)
- Pass Rate: 78.5% (543/692 collected, 97.8% excl. skipped)

## Next Steps

Per `plans/active/test-suite-triage.md`:
- Phase Q complete, all tasks [D]
- C19 gradient flow investigation via `[GRADIENT-FLOW-001]`
- Optional: Full-suite rerun to confirm C18 resolution persists
