# Phase Q Documentation Refresh - Summary

**STAMP:** 20251015T075029Z
**Task:** TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 / Next Action 14 - Phase Q documentation refresh
**Mode:** Docs-only (no pytest execution)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Objective

Document the approved 900-second slow-gradient tolerance across the core guidance documents before closing C18 (per `input.md` Do Now and `docs/fix_plan.md:791` Next Action 14).

## Documentation Updates

### 1. docs/development/testing_strategy.md §4.1

**Location:** Lines 525-531 (new section after "Execution Requirements")

**Added Section:** "Performance Expectations (Slow Gradient Suite)"

**Key Content:**
- Maximum runtime tolerance: 900 seconds for gradient stability tests on CPU with float64+compile guard
- Rationale: High-precision numerical gradient checks require extensive finite-difference computations
- Marker: Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.timeout(900)` and `@pytest.mark.slow_gradient`
- Validation: Phase P timing packet (2025-10-15T060354Z) established 900s ceiling; Phase Q validation (2025-10-15T071423Z) confirmed 839.14s runtime with 6.7% margin
- CI integration: pytest-timeout dependency requirement documented
- Evidence artifacts: Links to Phase P tolerance derivation and Phase Q validation results

### 2. arch.md §15

**Location:** Lines 375-379 (new section after "Gradient Test Execution Requirement")

**Added Section:** "Gradient Test Performance Expectations"

**Key Content:**
- Runtime tolerance: Up to 900 seconds on CPU for `test_property_gradient_stability` with float64+compile guard
- Rationale: Extensive finite-difference computations; 6% margin above validated baseline (839-845s range)
- Evidence: Links to Phase P timing packet and Phase Q validation
- Implementation: Test markers and pytest-timeout dependency requirement

### 3. docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md Section 5

**Location:** Lines 41 (new bullet under "Documentation & Tests")

**Added Bullet:** Gradient test performance note

**Key Content:**
- Slow gradient tests may legitimately run up to 900s on CPU with float64
- Expected behavior for high-precision numerical gradient checks, not a performance regression
- Phase Q evidence validates 839.14s runtime with 6.7% margin below ceiling

## Wording Consistency

All three updates follow ASCII-only formatting (no smart quotes or symbols), cite identical evidence artifacts (Phase P packet + Phase Q validation), and use consistent terminology:

- "900 seconds" / "900s" (tolerance ceiling)
- "6 percent" / "6.7 percent" (margin descriptions)
- "float64 precision" (test dtype requirement)
- "compile guard enabled" (NANOBRAGG_DISABLE_COMPILE=1 requirement)
- "Phase P timing packet (2025-10-15T060354Z)" (tolerance derivation)
- "Phase Q validation (2025-10-15T071423Z)" (validation results)

## Cross-References Preserved

No existing cross-references were deleted or modified. New references added:

- testing_strategy.md §4.1 → Phase P/Q artifact paths
- arch.md §15 → Phase P/Q artifact paths
- pytorch_runtime_checklist.md §5 → Phase Q artifact path

## Compliance Check

✅ No acceptance criteria or tolerance numbers changed beyond 900s
✅ ASCII-only wording (no smart quotes or symbols)
✅ Existing cross-references preserved
✅ New cross-references added only where mandated
✅ No pytest markers or manifests modified (already landed)
✅ No remediation trackers edited (awaiting final approval)
✅ New text explicitly cites both Phase P packet and Phase Q validation bundle
✅ No prior subsections deleted (appended/extended only)

## Files Modified

1. `docs/development/testing_strategy.md` (+7 lines, section §4.1)
2. `arch.md` (+5 lines, section §15)
3. `docs/development/pytorch_runtime_checklist.md` (+1 bullet, section 5)

## Sanity Check

No `git diff` anomalies detected:

- All changes additive (no deletions)
- Formatting consistent with surrounding text
- Line numbers sequential
- No trailing whitespace introduced

## Next Steps

Per `input.md` guidance and `plans/active/test-suite-triage.md:367` Phase Q table:

1. **Q6 - Ledger Closure:** Update `docs/fix_plan.md` TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001 Attempts History with Phase Q documentation STAMP and artifact paths; mark Next Action 14 complete
2. **Q7 - Tracker Refresh:** Update `remediation_tracker.md` C18 cluster entry with documentation completion note and reference to Phase Q bundle

## Evidence Artifacts

- **Summary:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_q/20251015T075029Z/docs/summary.md` (this file)
- **Modified Files:** 3 documentation files (testing_strategy.md, arch.md, pytorch_runtime_checklist.md)
- **Git Diff:** Available via `git diff` (not staged yet per directive)
- **Referenced Evidence:** Phase P packet (20251015T060354Z) + Phase Q validation (20251015T071423Z)

## Exit Criteria Met

✅ All three documentation touch points updated per Phase P §5.2 guidance
✅ Wording explicitly cites both Phase P and Phase Q artifacts
✅ ASCII-only formatting preserved
✅ Existing structure and cross-references maintained
✅ New cross-references point to validated evidence bundles
✅ No tolerance changes beyond approved 900s ceiling
✅ Docs-only loop (no pytest execution)

**Status:** Phase Q documentation refresh COMPLETE. Ready for supervisor review and Q6/Q7 ledger/tracker closure steps.
