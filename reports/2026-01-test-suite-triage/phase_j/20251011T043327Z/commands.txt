# Phase J — Remediation Tracker Bundle Creation
# Timestamp: 20251011T043327Z
# Initiative: [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]
# Mode: Docs-only (no pytest execution)
# Plan: plans/active/test-suite-triage.md (tasks J1–J3)

## Provenance & Inputs Consulted

### Primary Input Documents
- Phase I triage summary: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_i/20251011T042127Z/docs/triage_summary.md
  * 36 failures across 16 active clusters
  * Classification: 35 implementation bugs + 1 likely deprecation
  * Delta vs Phase F: -13 failures (-26% improvement)

- Phase I classification overview: reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_i/20251011T042127Z/docs/classification_overview.md
  * Evidence-backed cluster→spec mapping
  * Blocker chain analysis
  * Priority ladder (P1–P4)

- Fix-plan ledger: docs/fix_plan.md (lines 1–110)
  * Active focus on [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001]
  * In-progress items: [DETERMINISM-001], [CLI-FLAGS-003], [VECTOR-TRICUBIC-002], [VECTOR-PARITY-001]
  * Blocker notes: [DTYPE-NEUTRAL-001] status verification required

- Test suite triage plan: plans/active/test-suite-triage.md (tasks J1–J3)
  * J1: Draft remediation tracker (cluster→owner→fix-plan mapping)
  * J2: Define execution sequence (sprint order + gating tests)
  * J3: Update fix_plan dependencies

### Supporting References
- Spec: specs/spec-a-core.md (physics, geometry, RNG)
- Spec: specs/spec-a-cli.md (CLI surface)
- Spec: specs/spec-a-parallel.md (parity requirements)
- Architecture: arch.md (ADRs, runtime guardrails)
- Testing strategy: docs/development/testing_strategy.md (§§1.4–2.5)

## Artifacts Produced

1. remediation_tracker.md
   * Per-cluster table: ID, owner, fix-plan ID, count, priority, reproduction command, dependencies, exit criteria
   * Direct mapping from Phase I triage summary cluster table

2. remediation_sequence.md
   * Narrative execution order (P1 critical path → P2 infrastructure → P3 medium → P4 deferred)
   * Gating tests per sprint (e.g., determinism cluster gates before source weighting)
   * Blocker chain resolution strategy
   * Spec/arch citations justifying sequence

3. This file (commands.txt)
   * Provenance and methodology documentation

## Environment
- Python: 3.13.5
- pytest: 8.4.1
- PyTorch: 2.7.1+cu126
- CUDA: 12.6 (tests run with CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1)
- KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK: TRUE (required for all PyTorch test execution)

## Execution Notes
- No pytest execution this loop (docs-only per input.md line 21)
- Cluster IDs and counts exactly match Phase I triage_summary.md (no renumbering)
- Fix-plan IDs reused from existing ledger entries (no new IDs invented)
- Blocker chain preserved from Phase I classification_overview.md
- Protected assets (loop.sh, input.md, docs/index.md) untouched

## Next Actions (per plan task J3)
1. Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #12 with Phase J summary and artifact paths
2. Mark [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase J tasks (J1–J3) complete in plan
3. Commit Phase J bundle with descriptive message citing plan completion
