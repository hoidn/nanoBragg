# Phase K Analysis Summary
## Test Suite Triage - Post-Determinism Resolution

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Timestamp:** 20251011T072940Z
**Initiative:** [TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Attempt #16
**Phase:** K (K2-K3) — Classification Refresh & Tracker Update

---

## What Was Done

Phase K2-K3 delivered comprehensive triage artifacts reconciling Phase K pytest execution (31 failures) against the Phase I baseline (36 failures):

### K2: Triage Classification (COMPLETE)
✅ **Artifact:** `triage_summary.md`
- Classified all 31 failures across 14 active clusters
- Documented 3 resolved clusters (C2, C15: determinism; C1: CLI defaults)
- Identified 2-failure improvement in C3 (source weighting: 6→4)
- Labeled C12 as deprecation candidate (5 legacy tests)
- Updated reproduction commands and exit criteria for all clusters
- Cross-referenced Phase I → Phase K deltas with justifications

✅ **Artifact:** `classification_overview.md`
- Tallied implementation bugs (30) vs deprecations (1)
- Analyzed delta patterns: 3 resolved, 1 improved, 10 unchanged
- Assessed Sprint 1 readiness (blocker status: ALL CLEAR)
- Documented test suite health metrics (pass rate: 73.8%→74.5%)
- Provided runtime analysis (1867s→1841s, -1.4%)

### K3: Tracker Refresh (IN PROGRESS)
🔄 **Next Actions:**
1. Update `remediation_tracker.md` table:
   - Mark C2/C15 as ✅ RESOLVED
   - Update C3 count (6→4)
   - Refresh Sprint 1 completion (0→3 failures resolved, 17.6% complete)
2. Update `remediation_sequence.md`:
   - Note Sprint 1.1 (Determinism) complete
   - Update Sprint 1 progress bar (3/17)
   - Adjust remaining sprint targets
3. Create this summary file documenting K2/K3 highlights

## Key Findings

### 1. Determinism Resolution Validated (CRITICAL)
- **C2 (Determinism - Mosaic RNG):** 2 failures → 0 ✅
- **C15 (Mosaic Determinism):** 1 failure → 0 ✅
- **Total Impact:** -3 failures (-8.3% of Phase I total)
- **Validation:** All AT-PARALLEL-013 and AT-PARALLEL-024 tests passing (10 passed, 2 skipped)
- **Artifacts:** `reports/determinism-callchain/phase_e/20251011T060454Z/validation/`
- **Resolution Date:** 2025-10-11 (Attempt #10)

### 2. Source Weighting Partial Progress
- **C3 (Source Weighting):** 6 failures → 4 ⬇️
- **Improvement:** -2 failures (-33% cluster reduction)
- **Status:** Paused per input.md directive (awaiting K3 completion)
- **Next:** Resume Phase C implementation post-tracker refresh
- **Artifacts:** `reports/2026-01-test-suite-triage/phase_j/20251011T062955Z/source_weighting/` (Phase B semantics)

### 3. No New Regressions
- **10 clusters unchanged** — confirms determinism fixes did not introduce instability
- **Test collection stable** — 683→687 tests (+4, no collection errors)
- **Runtime improved** — 1867s→1841s (-26s, -1.4%)
- **Pass rate increased** — 73.8%→74.5% (+0.7pp)

### 4. Sprint 1 Progress Update
- **Sprint 1 Target:** 17 failures (C2, C3, C4, C8, C10, C15, C16, C18)
- **Resolved:** 3 failures (C2, C15)
- **Progress:** 17.6% complete (3/17)
- **Remaining:** 14 failures across 6 clusters
- **Next Priority:** C3 (source weighting, 4 failures) per Sprint 1.2

## Artifacts Delivered

### Phase K2 (Classification)
- ✅ `analysis/triage_summary.md` (31 failures, 14 clusters, full details)
- ✅ `analysis/classification_overview.md` (delta analysis, sprint readiness)
- ✅ `analysis/summary.md` (this file — K2/K3 highlights)

### Phase K3 (Tracker Refresh) — IN PROGRESS
- 🔄 Updated `remediation_tracker.md` (pending)
- 🔄 Updated `remediation_sequence.md` (pending)
- 🔄 Updated `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #16 entry (pending)

## Observations

1. **Determinism fix was high-impact** — Eliminated 3 failures with a single fix-plan item, demonstrating value of focused remediation on blocker clusters.

2. **Source weighting showing incremental progress** — 2-failure reduction suggests partial implementation or test alignment fixes; full resolution requires Phase C completion.

3. **Test suite stability confirmed** — No new failures introduced by determinism work; all unchanged clusters remain at Phase I counts.

4. **Sprint 1 on track** — With determinism complete, Sprint 1.2 (source weighting) is unblocked and can proceed immediately post-K3.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed with K3 tracker refresh** — Update remediation_tracker.md and remediation_sequence.md to reflect Phase K results.

2. **Resume [SOURCE-WEIGHT-002] Phase C** — Implement Option A semantics (equal-weight, dtype-neutral parser) per approved Phase B design.

3. **Maintain K-series discipline** — Continue full-suite reruns after major remediation milestones to catch regressions early.

4. **Consider C12 deprecation review** — Schedule spec discussion to determine if legacy test suite should be marked deprecated.

---

## Next Loop Guidance

**Per input.md "Do Now" (implicit):**
1. Complete K3 by updating `remediation_tracker.md` and `remediation_sequence.md`
2. Update `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempt #16 with K2/K3 artifact links
3. Commit K2/K3 deliverables with message: `[TEST-SUITE-TRIAGE-001] Phase K2-K3 complete: 31 failures classified, tracker refreshed`
4. Resume [SOURCE-WEIGHT-002] Phase C implementation in next loop

---

**Phase K2 COMPLETE. K3 tracker refresh in progress.**
