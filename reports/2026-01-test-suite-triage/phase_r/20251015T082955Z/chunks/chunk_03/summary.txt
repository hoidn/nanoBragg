CHUNK 03 TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY
================================

Status: TIMEOUT (20 minutes exceeded)
Exit Code: 124

Tests Collected: 62 items (1 skipped at collection)

Completed Tests Before Timeout:
- PASSED: ~43 tests
- FAILED: 1 test (test_at_perf_001.py::test_vectorization_scaling)
- SKIPPED: ~10 tests
- XFAIL: 1 test

Test that Caused Timeout:
- test_gradients.py::TestPropertyBasedGradients::test_property_gradient_stability

Analysis:
The test suite timed out during gradient stability tests. This is expected behavior
for gradient tests which can be computationally intensive. The test_property_gradient_stability
test likely involves extensive numerical gradient verification that exceeded the 20-minute limit.

Recommendation:
- Consider increasing timeout for gradient test chunks to 30+ minutes
- Or split gradient tests into a separate chunk with extended timeout
- The gradient tests that completed (11+) all passed successfully before the timeout
