**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Attempt:** #184  
**Mode:** Docs  
**Executor:** Ralph (loop i=181)

## Overview

Phase D2 ledger sync completed successfully. All documentation updated to reflect Phase D1 completion, shim plan archived, and references updated across plans/docs.

## Changes Made

1. **docs/fix_plan.md** (CLI-FLAGS-003 section):
   - Added Attempt #184 entry with Phase D2 completion summary
   - Updated Next Actions (line 461-464): Marked D1 complete (✅), D2 complete (✅), D3 remains open
   - Changed date from "2025-12-14 refresh" to "2025-10-08 refresh"

2. **plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md** → **plans/archive/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md**:
   - Moved via `git mv` to preserve history
   - Added comprehensive closure note (19 lines) at top of file
   - Closure note references Phase D1 bundle, explains archival rationale, provides cross-references

3. **plans/active/phi-carryover-removal/plan.md**:
   - Line 64: Updated D2 state from [ ] to [D] with completion summary
   - Line 56: Updated Status Snapshot to reflect D2 completion

## Verification

- **Test Collection:** `pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` → 2 tests collected (0.79s)
- **Reference Sweep:** All active plans now point to `plans/archive/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md`
- **Phase D Bundle:** Canonical evidence at `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_phi_removal/phase_d/20251008T203504Z/`

## Exit Criteria Met

✅ docs/fix_plan.md shows Attempt #184 with D2 completion  
✅ Next Actions updated to show only D3 open  
✅ Shim plan archived with closure note  
✅ Phase D bundle path referenced in ledger  
✅ pytest collection verified (2 tests)  
✅ galph_memory.md update pending (will be done in commit)

## Next Actions

- **galph_memory.md:** Update with D2 completion note and archived plan reference (Step 10 of input.md procedure)
