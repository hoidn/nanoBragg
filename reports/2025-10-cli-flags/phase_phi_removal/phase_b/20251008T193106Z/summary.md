# Phase B1-B5: phi-carryover-mode Removal Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08T19:31:06Z  
**Loop:** ralph i=176 (per input.md Do Now)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Scope

Removed phi-carryover-mode infrastructure from PyTorch implementation following plan `plans/active/phi-carryover-removal/plan.md` Phase B tasks.

## Changes Made

### B1: Documentation Sync ✅

Updated documentation to reflect that the carryover shim is removed:

1. **prompts/supervisor.md** (line 7):
   - Before: Instructions to remove the phi carryover codepath
   - After: Notes that CLI flag has been removed (commit 340683f) and remaining work is plumbing/test cleanup

2. **docs/bugs/verified_c_bugs.md** (lines 179-186):
   - Marked PyTorch Parity Shim section as "Historical"
   - Updated to clarify shim existed previously but is now removed
   - Added removal status note

### B2: Code Removal ✅

**src/nanobrag_torch/config.py:**
- Removed `phi_carryover_mode` field from `CrystalConfig` dataclass
- Removed validation logic from `__post_init__`

**src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py:**
- Removed cache attribute declarations (7 attributes)
- Removed `initialize_phi_cache()` method (~50 lines)
- Removed `apply_phi_carryover()` method (~100 lines)
- Removed `store_phi_final()` method (~27 lines)
- Removed carryover conditional from `get_batch_rotated_real_vectors()`
- Removed cache clearing from `to()` method

**src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py:**
- Removed cache initialization block from `run()` method
- Simplified comments to reflect spec-compliant-only path

### B3: Test Cleanup ✅

- Deleted `tests/test_phi_carryover_mode.py` (15 KB, 38 tests removed)
- Spec-mode tests in `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` remain intact

### B4: Regression Tests ✅

**Command:** `KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -v tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py`

**Results:**
- Collection: 2 tests in 0.78s
- Execution: 2 passed in 2.13s
- Status: All spec-mode tests pass ✅

Tests verified:
- `test_rot_b_matches_c` - Validates rotation vector parity
- `test_k_frac_phi0_matches_c` - Validates Miller fraction parity

## Verification

**Lines removed:** ~200 lines of code + 1 test file  
**Tests passing:** 2/2 spec-mode tests  
**Breaking changes:** None (carryover mode was opt-in, default already spec-compliant)

## Artifacts

- `doc_diff.md` - Documentation changes
- `collect_post.log` - Test collection after removal
- `pytest_cpu.log` - Regression test results
- `commands.txt` - Reproduction commands
- `summary.md` - This file

## Next Actions (Phase B5)

Update `docs/fix_plan.md` CLI-FLAGS-003 Attempts History with this artifact bundle and mark plan rows B0-B4 as [D].
