# Phase L1–L3 Documentation Sync — BLOCKED

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Loop:** ralph i=135
**Directive:** `input.md` Phase L1–L3 documentation sync

## Blocking Issue

The `input.md` references multiple artifacts and plan files that **do not exist** in the repository:

### Missing Plans
- `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` — File does NOT exist
- `plans/active/cli-phi-parity-shim/plan.md` — File does NOT exist

### Missing Artifact Directories
- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/` — Directory does NOT exist
- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/diagnosis.md` — File does NOT exist
- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/rot_vector/fix_checklist.md` — File does NOT exist
- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/parity_shim/20251201_dtype_probe/analysis_summary.md` — File does NOT exist

### Missing Test Files
- `tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py` — File does NOT exist (pytest selector from `input.md` line 5)

## Evidence

```bash
$ find . -name "cli-noise-pix0" -type d
# No results

$ find . -name "cli-phi-parity-shim" -type d
# No results

$ find reports/2025-10-cli-flags -type d 2>/dev/null
# No such file or directory

$ KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest --collect-only -q tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
ERROR: file or directory not found: tests/test_cli_scaling_phi0.py
no tests collected in 0.00s
```

## Analysis

The `input.md` references appear to be from a **prior initiative** or a **different branch** that was never merged into `feature/spec-based-2`. The referenced work (CLI-FLAGS-003, Phase L tolerance documentation) does not match the current repository state.

Current git status:
- Branch: `feature/spec-based-2`
- Latest commit: `55077fb [SYNC i=134] actor=ralph status=running`
- Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Verify branch context:** Check if this work should be on a different branch
2. **Supervisor clarification:** Request updated `input.md` with correct file references or confirmation to skip this loop
3. **Alternative task:** If Phase L work is complete/archived, provide new Do Now directive

## What Actually Exists

The repository DOES contain:
- 448+ pytest tests (collected successfully)
- Full test suite under `tests/test_at_*.py`
- Working PyTorch implementation in `src/`
- Documentation in `docs/`
- Spec files under `specs/`

But **none** of the CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase L artifacts referenced in `input.md` exist.

## Artifact Metadata

Created: 2025-10-07T[current time]
Purpose: Document blocking condition per `input.md` lines 13-14
Next: Await supervisor guidance before proceeding with documentation edits
