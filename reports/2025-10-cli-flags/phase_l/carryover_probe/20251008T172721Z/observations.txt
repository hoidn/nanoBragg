Trace Capture Observations
===========================

Execution Summary:
- Harness ran successfully for pixel (684, 1039)
- Captured 124 TRACE_PY lines in main trace
- Captured 10 TRACE_PY_PHI lines in per-phi trace
- Final intensity: 4.06016057371301e-07

Warnings Noted:
- datetime.utcnow() deprecation warnings (harmless, cosmetic)
- torch.tensor() copy construct warnings (harmless, can be suppressed)

Output Files:
- trace_py.log: Main trace log with 124 lines
- trace_py_per_phi.log: Per-phi trace with 10 lines (one per phi step)
- trace_harness_stdout.txt: Full stdout capture including warnings

Next Actions Per input.md:
- Compare against C trace (if available)
- Generate trace_diff.md via capture_live_trace.py
- Create metrics.json with first_divergence, F_latt values, runtime
- Update docs/fix_plan.md Attempt #167+ entry
