# Phase M4b Normalization Fix — Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08T22:38:05Z
**Objective:** Eliminate double `/ steps` division to restore I_before_scaling parity with nanoBragg.c
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS**

---

## Problem Statement

Prior to this fix, PyTorch was dividing the accumulated intensity by `steps` **twice**:

1. **Early division** at line 955 (oversample path) and line 1042 (no-oversample path):
   ```python
   normalized_intensity = intensity / steps
   ```

2. **Final division** at line 1130:
   ```python
   physical_intensity = (
       normalized_intensity
       / steps  # ← Second division
       * self.r_e_sqr
       * self.fluence
   )
   ```

This resulted in a ~14.6% intensity deficit (PyTorch: 805,473.79 vs C: 943,654.81) as documented in Phase M1 baseline evidence.

## Specification & C Reference

Per `specs/spec-a-core.md:247-250`, the normative contract requires:

> Final per-pixel scaling: Define steps = (number of sources) · (number of mosaic domains) · (phisteps) · (oversample²).
> After all loops, compute: **S = r_e² · fluence · I / steps**.

The authoritative C implementation (`golden_suite_generator/nanoBragg.c:3358`) confirms:

```c
/* convert pixel intensity into photon units */
test = r_e_sqr*fluence*I/steps;
```

Only **ONE** division by `steps` is required, occurring alongside the physical constants `r_e²` and `fluence`.

## Changes Implemented

### File: `src/nanobrag_torch/simulator.py`

#### Change 1: Oversample Path (lines 954-956)
**Before:**
```python
# Normalize by the total number of steps
subpixel_physics_intensity_all = subpixel_physics_intensity_all / steps

# PERF-PYTORCH-004 P3.0b: Polarization is now applied per-source inside compute_physics_for_position
# Only omega needs to be applied here for subpixel oversampling
```

**After:**
```python
# PERF-PYTORCH-004 P3.0b: Polarization is now applied per-source inside compute_physics_for_position
# Only omega needs to be applied here for subpixel oversampling
# NOTE: Do NOT divide by steps here - normalization happens once at final scaling (line ~1130)
```

#### Change 2: No-Oversample Path (lines 1039-1042)
**Before:**
```python
# CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1: Save both post-polar (current intensity) and pre-polar for trace
# The current intensity already has polarization applied (from compute_physics_for_position)
I_before_normalization = intensity.clone()

# Normalize by steps
normalized_intensity = intensity / steps

# PERF-PYTORCH-004 P3.0b: Polarization is now applied per-source inside compute_physics_for_position
# Only omega needs to be applied here
```

**After:**
```python
# CLI-FLAGS-003 Phase M1: Save both post-polar (current intensity) and pre-polar for trace
# The current intensity already has polarization applied (from compute_physics_for_position)
I_before_normalization = intensity.clone()

# PERF-PYTORCH-004 P3.0b: Polarization is now applied per-source inside compute_physics_for_position
# Only omega needs to be applied here
# NOTE: Do NOT divide by steps here - normalization happens once at final scaling (line ~1130)
normalized_intensity = intensity
```

## Adherence to Requirements

✅ **CLAUDE Rule #11:** C-code reference (nanoBragg.c:3336-3365) present in docstring at line 1113
✅ **Vectorization preserved:** No Python loops introduced; all operations remain batched tensor ops
✅ **Device/dtype neutrality maintained:** No `.cpu()`, `.cuda()`, or type-specific casts introduced
✅ **Differentiability intact:** No `.item()` or `.detach()` calls; computation graph preserved

## Next Actions (Phase M4d & Beyond)

### Immediate (Phase M4d)
- [ ] Run `scripts/validation/compare_scaling_traces.py` to confirm `first_divergence = None`
- [ ] Update `lattice_hypotheses.md` to close Hypothesis H4
- [ ] Capture checksums via `sha256.txt`

### Phase M5
- [ ] Repeat parity validation on CUDA (`--device cuda --dtype float64`)
- [ ] Re-run gradcheck harness from `reports/.../20251008T165745Z_carryover_cache_validation/`

### Phase M6
- [ ] Update `docs/fix_plan.md` Attempts History with closure metrics
- [ ] Append closure note to `scaling_validation_summary.md`
