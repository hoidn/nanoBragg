# Phase M2 Lattice Hypotheses ‚Äî 2025-12-06 Update

**Context**
- Plan: `plans/active/cli-noise-pix0/plan.md` Phase M2 (Fix lattice factor propagation)
- Focus pixel: (spixel=1039, fpixel=685) from supervisor command configuration
- Canonical traces:
  - PyTorch: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T075949Z/trace_py_scaling.log`
  - C reference: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/c_trace_scaling.log`
- Manual reproduction: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T075949Z/manual_sincg.md`

## Observed deltas (œÜ tick = 0)
| Term | PyTorch | C trace | Œî (abs) | Œî (rel) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `F_latt_a` | -2.35819512010207 | -2.36012735995387 | +1.93e-03 | -8.19e-04 |
| `F_latt_b` | 1.05066739326683 | 1.05079664302326 | -1.29e-04 | -1.23e-04 |
| `F_latt_c` | 0.960630659359605 | 0.960961003611676 | -3.30e-04 | -3.44e-04 |
| `F_latt` | -2.38013414214076 | -2.38319665299058 | +3.06e-03 | -1.29e-03 |
| `k_frac` | -0.607262620986129 | -0.607255839576692 | -6.78e-06 | +1.12e-05 |
| `rot_a_star[1]` | -0.0293789623945766 | -0.0293958845208845 | +1.69e-05 | -5.76e-04 |
| `rot_c_star[1]` | -0.0143496591104365 | -0.0143330159705160 | -1.66e-05 | +1.16e-03 |

- Using the PyTorch sincg helper with the **PyTorch** HKL fractions reproduces the PyTorch lattice factor (`-2.380125274`, matches manual_sincg.md).
- Repeating the calculation with the **C** HKL fractions yields the C lattice factor (`-2.383196653`), confirming the mismatch originates upstream of the sincg call (HKL fractions / rotated reciprocal vectors).
- Per-œÜ traces (`‚Ä¶/per_phi/‚Ä¶/trace_py_scaling_per_phi.log` vs `c_trace_scaling.log:277-287`) diverge at every tick by ~0.13%, so the issue is systematic rather than a single œÜ slice.

## Hypotheses

### H1 ‚Äî Rotated reciprocal vectors deviate after misset + œÜ pipeline
- Evidence: `rot_a_star_y` and `rot_c_star_y` differ by O(1e-5) between traces, while `rot_b_star_y` is identical.
- Impact: These components feed directly into `h = S¬∑a*`, `k = S¬∑b*`, `l = S¬∑c*`; a 1e-5 shift in `a*_y` alters `k_frac` by ~6.8e-06, large enough to move the sincg argument by ~2.1e-05œÄ.
- Suspect locus: `Crystal.get_rotated_reciprocal_vectors` (PyTorch) vs `nanoBragg.c` rotation block (lines 3008-3120). The PyTorch path likely accumulates rounding error when rebuilding reciprocal vectors from re-normalised real vectors; we need to verify volume renormalisation per œÜ tick, especially after spindle rotation.
- Next probe: extend trace instrumentation to dump PyTorch `ap/bp/cp` and `rot_*_star` immediately after œÜ rotation (before sincg) and compare numerically with C `TRACE_C_PHI` values. Confirm whether the mismatch appears before or after the `torch.cross` recomputation of reciprocal vectors.

### H2 ‚Äî œÜ rotation sequence may omit the "recalculate reciprocals from actual volume" step per tick
- Observation: C rotates real vectors for each œÜ and then recomputes reciprocal vectors using the actual triple product (Rule #13). The PyTorch implementation caches the base reciprocal vectors and applies rotation tensors, but may not re-enforce metric duality per œÜ (see `crystal.py:1084-1136`). If the cached tensors are reused without re-solving for `V_actual` each tick, small orthogonality drift accumulates.
- Validation step: instrument PyTorch œÜ loop to emit `V_actual` per tick and compare with C (which remains constant at `24682.2566301114 √Ö¬≥`). Any deviation suggests the duality enforcement is drifting.

### H3 ‚Äî Mixed precision in sincg inputs amplifies rounding error
- Clue: Supervisor command runs default dtype=float32. Even though traces were captured in float64 mode, several intermediate tensors (e.g., structure-factor lookups, rotation matrices) still originate as float32 and are cast late. The ‚âà1e-3 relative error would disappear if we force the entire lattice path to float64.
- Proposed check: rerun `trace_harness.py --pixel 685 1039 --dtype float64` and inspect whether `k_frac` and `F_latt` converge to the C values. If yes, the implementation change should promote the relevant tensors (rotated reciprocal vectors and scattering vector) to float64 before the sincg call.

## Recommended next steps

1. **Trace audit (H1/H2):** capture a fresh PyTorch trace with additional taps for `ap/bp/cp`, `rot_*_star`, and `V_actual` per œÜ tick; place output under `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<new_ts>/` and diff against `TRACE_C_PHI` entries.
2. **dtype experiment (H3):** use the harness to run in float64-only mode; if the lattice delta collapses, update plan notes to require float64 promotion or compensated evaluation in sincg.
3. **Implementation guardrails:** whenever the fix is attempted, reference `nanoBragg.c:3062-3095` in docstrings (CLAUDE Rule #11) and rerun `compare_scaling_traces.py` so `metrics.json` reports `first_divergence=None`.

## 2025-12-07 Update ‚Äî Carryover Shim Hypothesis
- Fresh inspection of `Crystal.get_rotated_real_vectors` shows the c-parity shim replaces œÜ=0 with the **current** pixel's œÜ=final vectors (advanced indexing over the œÜ dimension).
- C trace (`TRACE_C_PHI`) confirms œÜ=0 reuses the **previous** pixel's final œÜ state because `ap/bp/cp` persist across pixel iterations.
- Direct dumps from the harness (`python -m nanobrag_torch` snippet in supervisor loop 2025-12-07) show:
  - spec mode: œÜ=0 reciprocal vectors match the MOSFLM base orientation.
  - c-parity mode: œÜ=0 vectors exactly equal spec œÜ=9 vectors (`a*_y` delta ‚âà +1.69e-05), which matches the lattice drift recorded in `trace_py_scaling.log`.
- Consequence: `k_frac` in c-parity mode is biased by ‚âà6.8e-06 for this pixel, producing the observed 0.13% `F_latt` deficit and keeping `I_before_scaling` outside the ‚â§1e-6 gate.
- Next probe: Capture consecutive-pixel traces (e.g., pixel 684,1039 then 685,1039) to quantify the true C carryover vector and decide whether to cache œÜ-final state between pixels or introduce a deterministic seed to mimic the C bug exactly.

## 2025-12-08 Parity Test Failure ‚Äî M2e Evidence Capture

**Test Run:** 2025-12-08T10:21:55Z
**Artifacts:** `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T102155Z/parity_test_failure/`

**Command:**
```bash
env KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE pytest -vv tests/test_cli_scaling_parity.py::TestScalingParity::test_I_before_scaling_matches_c --maxfail=1
```

**Result:** FAILED (exit code 1)

**Key Metrics:**
- F_cell: Perfect match (190.27)
- F_latt: **DIVERGED**
  - Expected (C): -2.3831966530
  - Actual (PyTorch): 1.3794838506
  - Relative error: **157.88%** (1.57884)
  - Absolute delta: 3.762680504
- Test tolerance: ‚â§1e-6 relative (VG-2 gate)

**Root Cause:**
œÜ=0 carryover cache not working per-pixel. The current `_phi_carryover_cache` implementation operates between separate `run()` invocations (different images), not between consecutive pixels within the same image. Per M2d probe (Attempt #152), consecutive pixels show identical œÜ=0 ROTSTAR values, confirming no per-pixel carryover is occurring.

**Environment:**
- Python 3.13.7
- PyTorch 2.8.0+cu128
- CUDA available: true
- Device: CPU (dtype=float64 for precision)
- Git SHA: d25187b8370733bcbf94dcd702ab0c65fd837d30
- Prerequisites present: A.mat, scaled.hkl

**Next Steps:**
Per plan.md M2g‚ÄìM2i, implement pixel-indexed cache with shape `(S,F,N_mos,3)` per Option 1 design documented in `phi_carryover_diagnosis.md`. Cache must be device/dtype neutral, gradient-preserving (no `.detach()`), and indexed by `(slow, fast)` pixel coordinates during `_compute_physics_for_position` execution.

## 2025-10-08T17:47:53Z Metrics Refresh (M2i.2)
- Artifacts: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/20251008T174753Z/`
- Command: see `commands.txt` in the artifact directory (Phase M2i.2 metrics rerun).
- Result summary:
  - `I_before_scaling` remains the first divergence (relative delta ‚âà -0.9999995).
  - Downstream scaling factors (`polar`, `omega_pixel`, `cos_2theta`, `I_pixel_final`) continue to diverge because of the upstream lattice mismatch.
  - `r_e_sqr`, `fluence`, `steps`, and `capture_fraction` still PASS exactly (matching C within tolerance).
- Interpretation: Replaying the comparison with the latest Option‚ÄØB trace (`carryover_probe/20251008T172721Z/trace_py.log`) confirms no improvement ‚Äî the cache plumbing did not correct `F_latt`. Hypothesis H1/H2 (reciprocal vector drift/carryover semantics) remains active; no evidence yet that dtype (H3) is the primary driver.
- Next step: Proceed with plan task M2g.5 (trace tooling patch) so we can instrument per-œÜ taps under the cache-aware pipeline; keep focus on verifying per-pixel carryover rather than recalculating metrics again.

## 2025-10-22 Update ‚Äî Spec-Mode Bundle 20251008T212459Z (Phase M2)

**Context:**
- Fresh spec-mode baseline captured after œÜ-carryover shim removal (Phase D complete)

**Source Lines:**
- PyTorch: `trace_py_scaling.log:25-28` (F_latt), `:23` (hkl_frac), `:15` (rot_b)
- C: `c_trace_scaling.log:273-276` (F_latt), `:271` (hkl_frac), `:266` (rot_b)

### Ranked Hypotheses

#### H4 ‚Äî œÜ-Rotation Application Inconsistency (HIGH CONFIDENCE, NEW)

**Evidence:**
- rot_b Y-component differs by **6.8%** (0.672 vs 0.717 √Ö) ‚Äî largest relative vector component error
- This 0.0457 √Ö shift in rot_b propagates to k_frac via dot product S¬∑b
- k_frac shift of 3% (Œî=+0.018) moves sincg(œÄ¬∑k, Nb=47) evaluation point significantly
- sincg has zero-crossings and sign changes near k ‚âà integer values; shift from -0.607 to -0.589 crosses a critical boundary
- F_latt_b flips sign: C = +1.051, PyTorch = -0.858
- F_latt product inherits sign flip: C = -2.383, PyTorch = +1.379

**Mechanism:**
1. PyTorch œÜ-rotation implementation differs from C (spindle axis orientation? rotation matrix order? sign convention?)
2. Small rotation error accumulates in rot_b vector (especially Y-component)
3. k_frac = S¬∑b is pulled toward zero (less negative: -0.607 ‚Üí -0.589)
4. sincg(œÄ¬∑(-0.589), 47) evaluates at different regime than sincg(œÄ¬∑(-0.607), 47)
5. Sign flip or magnitude change in F_latt_b propagates to F_latt product
6. Net I_before_scaling = Œ£(F_cell¬≤ √ó F_latt¬≤) drops by 14.6%

**Validation Probes (Phase M3):**
- Add per-œÜ instrumentation to PyTorch (`TRACE_PY_PHI` lines matching C format)
- Manual sincg table: compute sincg(œÄ¬∑k, 47) for k ‚àà [-0.61, -0.58] in steps of 0.001
- Compare rotation matrix construction: `src/nanobrag_torch/models/crystal.py::get_rotated_real_vectors` vs `nanoBragg.c:2797-3095`
- Single-œÜ parity test (phisteps=1, phi=0) to isolate rotation vs accumulation issues

**Priority:** P0 (blocks Phase M4 implementation)

---

#### H5 ‚Äî Metric Duality Enforcement Missing Per-œÜ (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)

**Evidence:**
- C code regenerates reciprocal vectors from rotated real vectors per œÜ tick using actual volume (CLAUDE Rule #13)
- PyTorch may cache reciprocal vectors and apply rotation tensors without re-enforcing metric duality
- Small orthogonality drift could accumulate across œÜ steps
- However, single œÜ=0 snapshot already shows divergence, suggesting issue manifests immediately

**Validation Probes:**
- Instrument PyTorch œÜ loop to emit V_actual per tick
- Compare with C constant volume (24682.3 √Ö¬≥)
- Verify a¬∑a* = 1 holds within machine precision for each œÜ step

**Priority:** P1 (secondary to rotation issue)

---

#### H6 ‚Äî sincg Edge Case Handling (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE, REFINED FROM H2)

**Evidence:**
- sincg(x, N) = sin(N¬∑x) / sin(x) is sensitive near x ‚âà 0 and x ‚âà nœÄ
- PyTorch sincg implementation may differ from C in numerical stability guards
- For k_frac ‚âà -0.6, œÄ¬∑k ‚âà -1.88 rad (between -3œÄ/2 and -œÄ)
- Small shift in k_frac can cause large output swings if crossing zero-crossing

**Validation Probes:**
- Compare `src/nanobrag_torch/utils/physics.py::sincg` implementation vs `nanoBragg.c` sincg
- Manual calculation table (already listed under H4)
- Check Taylor expansion cutoffs and limit handling (x‚Üí0, x‚ÜínœÄ)

**Priority:** P1 (likely secondary to rotation issue, but needs verification)

---

#### H7 ‚Äî Per-œÜ Cache Artifact (LOW CONFIDENCE, HISTORICAL)

**Evidence:**
- Phase D explicitly removed œÜ-carryover shim and validated removal
- Prior hypothesis that cached vectors propagate across œÜ steps
- Evidence bundle from Phase D shows shim removal successful

**Status:** RULED OUT by Phase D validation
- `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_phi_removal/phase_d/20251008T203504Z/`
- Still listed for historical continuity

---

#### H8 ‚Äî Tricubic Interpolation Mismatch (RULED OUT, CONFIRMED)

**Evidence:**
- Both C and PyTorch access same HKL grid cell (-7, -1, -14)
- F_cell_nearest = 190.27 matches exactly
- PyTorch emits full 4√ó4√ó4 tricubic grid matching HKL file
- C appears to use `-nointerpolate` or defaults to nearest neighbor

**Conclusion:** NOT a divergence source; both implementations agree on structure factor value.

---

### Next Actions (Phase M3 Gate)

Before proceeding to Phase M4 implementation:

1. **Deliver per-œÜ PyTorch trace** with TRACE_PY_PHI format matching C
2. **Generate sincg sensitivity table** for k ‚àà [-0.61, -0.58]
3. **Execute single-œÜ parity test** (phisteps=1, phi=0) to isolate issue
4. **Audit rotation matrix construction** comparing PyTorch vs C line-by-line
5. **Document findings** in Phase M3 validation probe reports

All artifacts under: `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_validation/<date>/phase_m3_probes/`

### Summary

The 14.6% I_before_scaling divergence is **fully attributed to F_latt sign flip** caused by **œÜ-rotation inconsistency** between PyTorch and C implementations. The rot_b Y-component error (6.8%) is the smoking gun, propagating through k_frac to F_latt_b and ultimately to I_before_scaling. All downstream scaling factors (r_e¬≤, fluence, steps, capture, polar, omega, cos_2theta) remain in perfect parity (‚â§1e-6 relative).

**Root Cause Hypothesis:** H4 (œÜ-Rotation Application Inconsistency) ‚Äî HIGH CONFIDENCE

**Blocking Issue:** PyTorch rotation implementation deviates from C, requiring systematic comparison of rotation matrix construction and spindle axis application.
