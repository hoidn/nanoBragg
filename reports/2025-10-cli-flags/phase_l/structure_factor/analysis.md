## Findings Summary

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY: All Sources Contain Target Reflection

**Result:** The target reflection (-7,-1,-14) with F=190.27 **IS PRESENT** in all tested data sources.

| Source | Grid Shape | h Range | k Range | l Range | Target In Range? | Retrieved F | Delta from C |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| scaled.hkl | 49×57×62 | [-24,24] | [-28,28] | [-31,30] | ✅ YES | 190.27 | 0.0 |
| Fdump_181401.bin | 49×57×62 | [-24,24] | [-28,28] | [-31,30] | ✅ YES | 190.27 | 0.0 |
| Fdump_c_20251109.bin | 49×57×62 | [-24,24] | [-28,28] | [-31,30] | ✅ YES | 190.27 | 0.0 |

### HKL File Coverage (scaled.hkl)

- **Grid ranges:** h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30]
- **Grid shape:** 49×57×62 = 168,546 reflections
- **Target in range:** YES ✅
- **Retrieved F_cell:** 190.27
- **Delta from C:** 0.0 (exact match)

**Conclusion:** The expanded HKL file contains the full grid needed for the supervisor command, contradicting previous belief that it was a 13-byte stub with only (1,12,3).

### Fdump Coverage

Both Fdump binaries tested have identical coverage:

1. **Fdump_scaled_20251006181401.bin**
   - Grid shape: 49×57×62
   - Ranges: h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30]
   - Retrieved F_cell for (-7,-1,-14): 190.27
   - Delta from C: 0.0

2. **Fdump_c_20251109.bin**
   - Grid shape: 49×57×62
   - Ranges: h∈[-24,24], k∈[-28,28], l∈[-31,30]
   - Retrieved F_cell for (-7,-1,-14): 190.27
   - Delta from C: 0.0

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### Previous Misdiagnosis (2025-10-07 Attempt #75)

The previous analysis stated:
> "HKL coverage gap confirmed: scaled.hkl contains exactly ONE reflection (1,12,3) with F=100.0"

This was **INCORRECT**. The scaled.hkl file actually contains the full 168k reflection grid.

### Actual Root Cause

The PyTorch F_cell=0 divergence is **NOT** due to missing data in scaled.hkl. Instead, it stems from one of:

1. **Harness configuration mismatch:** The trace harness may not be loading scaled.hkl at all, defaulting to default_F=0
2. **HKL attachment timing:** The HKL data may be loaded but not properly attached to the Crystal instance before simulation
3. **Metadata mismatch:** The probe uses explicit `hkl_metadata` attachment, but the simulator flow may use a different loading path
4. **Different file path:** The simulator may be looking for HKL data in a different location than scaled.hkl

### Evidence from Probe

The probe demonstrates that PyTorch's structure-factor lookup logic works correctly when HKL data is properly attached:

```python
crystal.hkl_data = F_grid
crystal.hkl_metadata = metadata
F_result = crystal.get_structure_factor(h_t, k_t, l_t)  # Returns 190.27 ✅
```

This proves the interpolation/lookup math is correct; the issue is configuration/loading.

## Reconciliation with Attempt #75 Findings

Attempt #75 stated:
> "scaled.hkl contains exactly ONE reflection (1,12,3)"

This was based on examining the file with incorrect assumptions. The actual file structure is:
- **File size:** 1.3 MB (not 13 bytes)
- **Grid coverage:** Full reciprocal space grid with 168,546 reflections
- **Format:** Binary Fdump format, NOT the minimal text HKL stub

The 13-byte reference may have been confusing scaled.hkl with a different file or misinterpreting file header metadata.

## Next Actions (Phase L3c)

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify harness HKL loading:** Review `reports/2025-10-cli-flags/phase_l/scaling_audit/trace_harness.py` to confirm:
   - Does it call `read_hkl_file('scaled.hkl')` or similar?
   - Are `crystal.hkl_data` and `crystal.hkl_metadata` properly attached?
   - Is the attachment happening before `Simulator` instantiation?

2. **Compare probe vs harness setup:** The probe successfully retrieves F=190.27. Identify what the probe does differently from the trace harness.

3. **CLI validation:** Verify that the PyTorch CLI (`nanoBragg` command) properly loads HKL files when provided via `-hkl` flag.

### Ingestion Strategy (Phase L3c Implementation)

**Recommendation:** NO SIMULATOR CODE CHANGES NEEDED for structure factor ingestion.

The probe confirms that:
- PyTorch's `read_hkl_file` correctly parses scaled.hkl ✅
- PyTorch's `get_structure_factor` correctly retrieves values when data is attached ✅
- All necessary data exists in scaled.hkl ✅

**Required fix:** Ensure the trace harness (and by extension, the CLI) properly loads and attaches HKL data:

```python
# Correct pattern (from probe.py)
F_grid, metadata = read_hkl_file('scaled.hkl', default_F=0.0, device=device, dtype=dtype)
crystal = Crystal(config)
crystal.hkl_data = F_grid
crystal.hkl_metadata = metadata
```

### Updated Plan Task Guidance

**L3b → L3c transition:** Instead of patching simulator.py scaling chain (lines 930-1085), the fix should:

1. Audit `trace_harness.py` to find why HKL data isn't being loaded/attached
2. Fix the harness to mirror the probe's successful data attachment pattern
3. Verify the CLI `__main__.py` follows the same pattern when `-hkl` is provided
4. Re-run the scaling trace to confirm F_cell=190.27 appears in PyTorch output

**L3d regression tests:** Should validate that:
- CLI with `-hkl scaled.hkl` loads all 168k reflections
- Structure factor lookup for (-7,-1,-14) returns 190.27
- End-to-end intensity matches C reference

## Technical Notes

### File Size Reconciliation

| File | Size | Format | Reflections |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| scaled.hkl | 1.3 MB | Binary Fdump | 168,546 |
| Fdump_181401.bin | 1.4 MB | Binary Fdump | 168,546 |
| Fdump_c_20251109.bin | 1.4 MB | Binary Fdump | 168,546 |

All three files contain the same grid (49×57×62) and the same F value (190.27) for the target reflection.

### Grid Density Analysis

```
Grid: 49×57×62 = 168,546 total points
Coverage: h∈[-24,24] (49 values)
          k∈[-28,28] (57 values)
          l∈[-31,30] (62 values, includes l=-31)
```

This is a comprehensive reciprocal space grid suitable for the detector geometry and wavelength in the supervisor command.

## Conclusion

**Phase L3b Complete:** Structure-factor source confirmed. The C code derives F_cell=190.27 from the same scaled.hkl file that PyTorch should be using. The divergence is a **configuration/loading issue**, not a data coverage issue.

**Next Phase:** L3c should focus on fixing HKL data attachment in the trace harness and CLI, not on modifying simulator.py scaling math.

**Artifacts for Closure:**
- ✅ `probe.log` — Complete execution log with all three source tests
- ✅ `analysis.md` — This document
- ✅ Updated fix_plan.md entry pending (Attempt #76)
