"""Acceptance test AT-SRC-001: Sourcefile and weighting.

From spec-a.md:
- AT-SRC-001 Sourcefile and weighting
  - Setup: -sourcefile with two sources having distinct weights and λ; disable other sampling.
  - Expectation: steps = 2; intensity contributions SHALL sum with per-source λ and weight,
    then divide by steps.

Source file format (from spec):
- Each line: X, Y, Z (position vector in meters), weight (dimensionless), λ (meters)
- Missing fields default to:
  - Position along −source_distance·b (source_distance default 10 m)
  - Weight = 1.0
  - λ = λ0
- Positions are normalized to unit direction vectors
- The weight column is read but ignored (equal weighting results)
